### Efficient Search over Personal Repositories - Secure and Sovereign!


The EPSRC-funded ESPRESSO project (“Efficient Search over Personal Repositories – Secure and Sovereign”) researches, develops and evaluates decentralised algorithms, meta-information data structures, and indexing techniques to enable large-scale data search across personal online datastores, taking into account varying access rights and caching requirements. It is a joint project between the University of Southampton and Birkbeck, University of London.
