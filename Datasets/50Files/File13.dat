1	Primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder. A clinicopathologic analysis of 72 cases. Adenocarcinomas account for approximately 2% of primary epithelial malignancies of the urinary bladder. The clinicopathologic features of 72 cases treated at one institution are reported; 22 cases were evaluated immunohistochemically. Twenty-four tumors were urachal and 48 nonurachal. The cases were analyzed according to their stage at presentation, histologic type, and mucin staining; they were tested immunohistochemically to determine their reaction to carcinoembryonic antigen, Leu-M1, prostate-specific antigen, and prostatic acid phosphatase. Tumor stage was a highly significant predictor of outcome (P = 0.001). Nonurachal tumors tended to have a worse outcome than urachal, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Histologic type was not a significant predictor of outcome (P = 0.10). For adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder, stage was the most significant predictive factor; separating urachal from nonurachal tumors was important, but mucin histochemistry and immunohistochemistry did not help in this distinction. On occasion, a few tumors may react with some polyclonal antibodies to prostate-specific antigen; thus these results must be interpreted with caution. In these instances, the possibility of using highly sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies such as the one employed in this study should be considered. 
4	Diagnosis and evaluation of renovascular hypertension. Indications for therapy. Renovascular hypertension is caused by two distinct conditions with different causes, fibromuscular dysplasia and atheroma. Diagnosis of the former is both simpler and more rewarding, whereas atheromatous lesions of the renal artery may be secondary to essential hypertension. It is therefore important to establish existence of functional renal ischemia as well as an anatomical lesion. Universal screening of all hypertensive patients is not recommended because of the relatively low prevalence of the disease and insufficient accuracy of available screening tests. When renovascular hypertension is clinically suspected, an oral captopril test is the most reliable office screening test. After this, digital subtraction angiography with renal vein renins or captopril renography are appropriate steps. However, the latter procedure, while promising, requires further evaluation. Duplex scanning of the renal arteries also comes into this category. Arteriography is done last, so that if renal ischemia is indicated, angioplasty can be attempted at the same time as arteriography. 
3	Concomitant neurocysticercosis and brucellosis. A young Mexican woman had headache and left arm weakness develop shortly after immigrating to the United States. A solitary cerebral cysticercus was found at surgery, but, instead of the expected finding of clear fluid, the cyst contained pus from which Brucella melitensis was cultured. Although the patient had no signs or symptoms suggestive of brucellosis, agglutination studies revealed IgM and IgG antibodies consistent with active brucellosis. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of multiple infections in immigrants from countries where parasites and bacteria that are uncommon in the United States are endemic. 
5	Influence of untreated chronic plastic iridocyclitis on intraocular pressure in leprosy patients. The intraocular pressures of a total of 286 eyes of patients with lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy who never had regular ophthalmological care or local eye treatment were measured. The patients were categorised according to the type of leprosy they had, and the eyes were categorised as without or with chronic plastic iridocyclitis. In patients with lepromatous and borderline lepromatous types of leprosy the intraocular pressure was significantly lower in eyes with chronic plastic iridocylitis 10.1 (3.6) mmHg than in both unaffected eyes 11.0 (3.2) mmHg and control eyes 13.5 (2.5) mmHg. It has been shown that chronic plastic iridocyclitis which remains untreated for years results in a lower intraocular pressure than normal. 
1	Prognostic implications of DNA histogram, DNA content, and histologic changes of regional lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer. Forty-six cases of resected lung cancer, including 20 cases at Stages I and II and 26 cases at Stage III (N2), were subdivided into two groups: a good prognosis group with a longer survival period and a poor prognosis group in which the patients died earlier of the cancer. From paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues of these patients, the authors examined DNA histogram pattern and DNA content, using flow cytometry, and histologic hyperplasia of germinal center and paracortical area; they also evaluated their correlation with the prognosis. In the good prognosis group at Stages I and II, paracortical hyperplasia (PH) of the lymph nodes was observed significantly more frequently. In the good prognosis group at Stage III, the incidence of PH, G2M phase in the DNA histograms, and DNA content were all significantly higher. DNA content was positively correlated with the grade of PH. 
1	Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and interleukin-1 by epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor. The immunoreactivity for class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in Warthin's tumor (WT) cells was studied. In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells, and capillary endothelia, the luminal tumor cells and some keratinocytes in the metaplastic squamous foci exhibited immunoreactivity for both class II antigens and IL-1. The distribution of the class II antigens in the luminal tumor cells was limited to their basolateral membrane. These data, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the luminal tumor cells of WT introduce the luminal antigen to the underlying lymphoid tissue and, thus, act as an antigen-presenting cell. 
4	Determinants and significance of diltiazem plasma concentrations after acute myocardial infarction. The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial Research Group. A total of 1,975 plasma diltiazem concentrations were obtained from 1,067 patients enrolled in a multicenter secondary intervention study of diltiazem after acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the determinants and significance of diltiazem concentrations in this patient population, we related drug concentrations to a variety of clinical variables recorded on the case history forms. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that (1) time from the last drug dose, (2) drug dose taken, (3) patient height (an index of lean body weight), and (4) patient age were important determinants of plasma concentration. For an equivalent dose, plasma diltiazem concentrations in a 75-year-old patient were about double those of a 25-year-old patient. Total weight and drug dose prescribed did not significantly affect plasma concentrations. Whereas drug concentrations were higher (p = 0.01) among patients with left-sided heart failure, they were not altered by renal dysfunction, hepatic disease or beta blockers. Diltiazem concentrations were a significant determinant of diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 10(-9), but neither systolic pressure nor heart rate were significantly related to diltiazem concentration. The overall incidence of adverse experiences was not related to drug concentrations, but the occurrence of second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in the coronary care unit and the need for a temporary pacemaker were substantially higher among patients with a drug concentration greater than 150 ng/ml (7.4 and 1.9%, respectively) than among patients with lower concentrations (2.6% for atrioventricular block, 0.3% for pacemaker; p = 0.02 for each). The risk of atrioventricular block was particularly increased by high diltiazem concentrations in the face of acute inferior infarction. These results suggest that diltiazem's pharmacologic and clinical effects in a large population are concentration-related, and that the consideration of patient size, age, and left ventricular function in selecting a diltiazem dose may allow for effective drug therapy with a reduced likelihood of adverse effects. 
1	Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. A study in resected cases. The radiologic and histologic findings are presented of the resection of 14 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), less than 2 cm in maximum diameter, after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TCE) using iodized oil. The effect of TCE on small HCC depended on the morphologic type of the tumors. When no extracapsular invasion of tumor cells occurred, TCE was extremely effective against encapsulated tumors. However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor. The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC. 
4	Bronchiolar morphology after systemic arterial interruption. To assess ischemic lesions as a factor in obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation, the authors severed the left bronchial arteries of 15 dogs, together with the left stem bronchus, the latter being immediately reanostomosed. They examined the bronchioles at weekly interfals up to three and a half months. On the week chosen each dog was anesthetized, totally heparinized, and exsanguino-perfused with saline. Just after heart arrest, the thoracic aorta was injected with a barium solution until this white medium appeared in the bronchial arteries. The heart-lung blocs were excised en bloc, submitted to soft-tissue x ray, fixed, and then sliced to 1 cm. Corresponding right and left 5-mm-thick samples of these slices were prepared for contact microradiography followed by histologic 5-to-20-micron-thick, stained, correlated specimens. For two weeks the left bronchial arteries remained empty, but there was no necrosis or edema. Between two and four weeks barium solution appeared in the bronchial arteries, and the bronchiolar epithelium had become multistratified. Later the left bronchiangiogram became similar to the right, but there were more folds of the mucosa and a little submucosal fibrosis. These studies provide proof that no significant ischemic lesions occurred during repermeation of the bronchiolar vascular bed. Ischemia, if existent, is not a significant factor in obliterative bronchiolitis. 
3	Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases. Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy. Serious postoperative complication is unlikely. However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus. The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%. The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension. 
4	Infective endocarditis and an embolomycotic aneurysm in a 25-month-old child. Infective endocarditis in young children is uncommon, especially where there is no underlying structural heart disease. While septic embolization in adults occurs in up to 43% of the cases of endocarditis, there is little data on systemic embolization in cases of children. We present an unusual case of a 25-month-old child with infective endocarditis and an embolomycotic aneurysm treated by mitral valve replacement and aortoiliac reconstruction. 
4	Retinal arterial macroaneurysms: risk factors and natural history. A case control study was conducted to identify the systemic and ocular risk factors for retinal arterial macroaneurysms. Forty-three patients with 52 photographically confirmed macroaneurysms were located. Forty-three age-matched, race-matched concurrent control patients were also identified. The patients with macroaneurysms had decreased visual acuity (p less than 0.0001) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.037), female sex (p = 0.099), and retinal vein occlusions (p = 0.055) than controls. In patients with both a macroaneurysm and venous occlusion there was a 12.0 times higher prevalence of macroaneurysms in the area of retina drained by the occluded vein (p less than 0.05). Common findings associated with macroaneurysms included retinal haemorrhage (81% of patients), retinal exudate (70%), vitreous haemorrhage (30%), macular involvement (30%), and distal arteriolar narrowing (26%). Arteriolar occlusion occurred spontaneously (8%) or after laser photocoagulation (16%). 
4	Pulse rate, coronary heart disease, and death: the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. To determine whether associations of elevated resting pulse rate with CHD incidence or death in white men are independent of other risk factors and whether such associations exist for women and blacks, data were examined from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Over a follow-up period of 6 to 13 years, elevated RR for CHD incidence were found for older white men with baseline pulse greater than 84 beats/min compared with less than 74 beats/min after controlling multiple risk factors (RR = 1.37, 95% CL 1.02, 1.84). Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors. CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate. Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases, were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors. CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate. Risk of death from all causes and cardiovascular diseases was elevated in black men and women with elevated pulse rate. Risk of death from noncardiovascular disease was elevated in black men with elevated pulse rate. The association with cardiovascular death was particularly striking in black women, even after adjusting for baseline risk factors (RR 3.03, 95% CL 1.46, 6.28). Further studies are needed to assess associations of pulse rate with CHD in blacks and to elucidate mechanisms in all groups. 
5	Achieving pH control in the critically ill patient: the role of continuous infusion of H2-receptor antagonists. Stress-related gastric mucosal damage is a common occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this mucosal damage, many ICU patients routinely receive prophylactic therapy, usually with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Gastric acid secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, with late afternoon and evening surges. H2RAs by continuous infusion may control this uneven pattern of secretion more effectively than H2RAs given by bolus injection. More studies are needed to identify the target ICU population for prophylactic treatment. 
5	Managing prostatitis in the elderly. Bacterial prostatitis is primarily a disease of elderly men, and it is the most common urinary tract infection seen in this age group. Urosepsis from prostatitis or prostatic abscess occurs less frequently than with urological manipulation, but must always be considered in elderly men with prostatitis. This article focuses on the diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of bacterial prostatitis in the elderly. 
1	Esthesioneuroblastoma with intracranial extension. The authors present five cases of olfactory neuroblastoma with intracranial extension operated on in the Department of Neurosurgery in collaboration with otorhinolaryngologists. This tumor is most frequently reported as growing inside the nasal cavities, and it can extend to the paranasal sinuses. Cases presenting initially as intracranial tumors have been infrequently reported. At present, histological diagnosis of this tumor is aided by the use of electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Total resection combined with radiation therapy remains the most satisfactory treatment. 
4	Assay of serum cardiac myosin heavy chain fragments in patients with acute myocardial infarction: determination of infarct size and long-term follow-up. To evaluate the correlation between myosin heavy chain release and the necrosis mass, serum levels of myosin heavy chain fragments were determined serially in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Eight of these patients were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents: the others were not treated. The same myosin titration was applied to the sera of 25 dogs with an experimental myocardial infarction. Six of the dogs were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents. The time courses of the myosin concentrations are typical and monophasic for all patients with a noncomplex myocardial infarction. The values for the kinetic parameters of myosin release are comparable to those previously reported. We have now determined that cumulative myosin release significantly correlates with cumulative creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase release, as well as with thallium-201 distribution, as determined for different patient groups. Thrombolytic treatment does not seem to qualitatively upset myosin kinetics. The results obtained in dogs with or without thrombolysis conclusively indicate that myosin release is a quantitative index of the necrosis mass. From a practical point of view, a few serial determinations of serum levels of myosin heavy chains are enough to estimate the necrosed mass in patients with acute myocardial infarction. More generally, serum myosin titration could be useful in detecting any cardiac disturbance involving myocardial injury resulting in membrane leakage of cardiac cells. 
1	Vimentin expression appears to be associated with poor prognosis in node-negative ductal NOS breast carcinomas. Vimentin expression in tumors from 83 node-negative and 112 node-positive patients with infiltrative ductal not otherwise specified (NOS) breast carcinomas has been compared with 5-year survival. For node-negative, but not for node-positive patients, there was a significant inverse relation between vimentin expression and survival. Five-year survival of node-negative patients with vimentin-positive tumors was significantly worse compared with vimentin-negative tumors (P less than 0.0001). In the node-negative group, only 36% of patients with vimentin-positive tumors but 82% of patients with vimentin-negative tumors survived 5 years. Tumors of all eight node-negative patients with ductal NOS cancer who died in the first 27 months expressed vimentin. Multivariate analysis of the node-negative group showed a strong correlation of vimentin expression and overall survival, but weak and not significant correlation between histologic grade or size and overall survival at 5 years. Thus vimentin expression seems to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis in node-negative ductal NOS breast carcinomas. 
1	Trends in female breast cancer in Connecticut and the United States. Trends for female breast cancer were examined by age, period and cohort for the years 1950-1984 in U.S. mortality. Connecticut mortality and Connecticut incidence. Birth cohort patterns were evident for all three sets of data. The results confirm a continuing increase in invasive breast cancer by providing evidence of a strong birth cohort pattern, over a time series of 90 years of birth cohorts. This trend appears to be real for the most part because of the cohort patterns and because there is minimal underdetection in data obtained by autopsy and blind biopsy. Secondly, when cohort modeling is applied to breast cancer mortality, there is an indication of a modest decline in recent breast cancer mortality (in the face of an apparent long-term increase), which suggests that control of breast cancer mortality may have developed in recent decades, perhaps through earlier detection and improved treatment. Finally, in contrast with a prior report, there is little evidence for a clinically important difference in time trend between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. 
4	Late effects of treatment for Wilms' tumor. A report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group. The National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) was initiated in 1969. One of its objectives was to modulate treatments according to risk factors to minimize the number and severity of treatment-related short-term and long-term iatrogenic complications. The NWTS has therefore incorporated a Long Term Follow-up Study (LTFS) within its framework to monitor late effects. The LTFS is confined to relapse-free survivors alive 5 years or longer after initial surgery, and data are collected using specifically designed forms. A total of 787 patients registered on NWTS-1 or NWTS-2 (1969 to 1979) were eligible, of whom 680 (86%) were available for analysis regarding musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychologic status, and the presence of benign and malignant tumors. Patients with early-stage disease who were treated with radiation had scoliosis reported, along with other musculoskeletal abnormalities (32 versus 2), nearly seven times as often as did the members of the cohort population who did not undergo radiation (35 of 57 versus 5 of 53, respectively). The difference in cardiovascular problems recorded in survivors who did and did not receive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (2.4 versus 1.1 per 100-person years at risk) had borderline statistical significance (P = 0.06). No excess in neuropsychologic events was reported for those given the neurotoxin vincristine. When considering patients with disease of all stages, all 5 second malignant tumors occurred in the 623 patients who underwent radiation (RT patients); benign tumors were also more frequent in RT patients than in those patients who did not undergo radiation (41 of 486 or 8% versus 4 of 194 or 2%). Continuing study of this unique body of patients is needed, especially for those given Adriamycin, because of the known long interval needed for latent cardiomyopathy to become clinically manifest in some patients. 
5	IL-2-PE40 prevents the development of tumors in mice injected with IL-2 receptor expressing EL4 transfectant tumor cells. A number of different immunotherapeutic reagents are currently being developed to target IL-2R for the treatment of leukemia, graft rejection, and certain autoimmune diseases. Previously, we have shown that IL-2-PE40, a chimeric protein composed of human IL-2 linked to the N-terminus of a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), could effectively kill a variety of cell lines in vitro expressing either low, intermediate, or high affinity IL-2R. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2-PE40 can successfully retard or prevent the growth of a lethal ascites tumor or a solid tumor composed of EL4J murine thymoma cells transfected with the p55 murine IL-2R. The transfected line, EL4J-3.4, expresses 1,000 to 3,000 high affinity IL-2R. Survival extension in the ascites model was achieved by initiating treatment either after 4 to 6 h or within 5 days post-tumor injection in both athymic nude and C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, the growth of an aggressive s.c. solid tumor could also be inhibited. Extension of survival was not achieved either by using the truncated toxin alone not attached to IL-2 or by using an IL-2-PE40Asp553 mutant lacking a functional toxin. Survival extension was not caused by IL-2 activated NK or other host effector mechanisms as IL-2-PE40 was unable to prevent the receptor-negative EL4J parental line from forming a lethal ascites or a solid tumor. Thus, IL-2-PE40 is a potent, specific cytolytic reagent that may prove useful in the arsenal of anti-IL-2R immunotherapeutics. 
4	Reliability of death certificate diagnoses. Consistency between death certificates and clinical records from 5 general hospitals in Kuwait was studied for 470 deaths with the following underlying or associated causes: hypertensive (HYP), ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Direct causes were not considered since they are of little interest analytically. Only deaths with definite or most probable ascertainment were included. One cardiologist, who was provided with the WHO criteria and relevant documents on death certification, independently reviewed the records. To test the reviewer's bias and the reliability of his judgement, an adjudication process was effected by having one senior cardiologist re-review a random subsample of 140 records. The two reviewers showed good agreement. Specific diagnoses criteria for deciding the underlying cause of death in multiple morbid conditions by the reviewer were followed. Due to possible reviewer bias, we aimed at measuring the difference between initial certifiers and the reviewer rather than measuring the diagnostic accuracy of initial certifiers in reference to the reviewer. The agreement index kappa showed poor agreement between original and revised certificates. The original certificates under-estimated CVD as an underlying cause of death by 69.2%, DM by 60%, IHD by 33.5% and HYP by 31.8% in our sample. Associated causes were also consistently under-estimated by initial certifiers as compared with the reviewer. This bias calls for basing mortality statistics in Kuwait on hospital death committees' reports rather than on initial certifier death certificates, use of multiple-causes of death instead of one underlying cause and adequate training of the medical profession on the value and process of death certification. 
1	Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons. Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone. Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors. 
3	Intracranial hypertension in relation to memory functioning during the first year after severe head injury. The relationship between intracranial hypertension and residual memory deficit after closed head injury was evaluated using the 6-month and 1-year neurobehavioral outcome data obtained by the Traumatic Coma Data Bank. Intracranial pressure was analyzed using the percentage of time that it exceeded 20 mm Hg and the maximum value recorded during the first 72 hours after injury. Memory measures included recall of word lists, prose recall, and visual memory for designs that were obtained 6 months (n = 149) and 1 year (n = 132) after injury. Intracranial hypertension occurred in more than half of the Traumatic Coma Data Bank cohort who met the criteria for the neurobehavioral follow-up study. Linear regression analysis disclosed an effect of elevated intracranial pressure on some, but not all, measures of memory at 6 months, whereas the results were negative for the 1-year follow-up examination. We conclude that the elevation of intracranial pressure exerts little if any effect on later memory functioning, and that any effect it does have diminishes over 1 year in survivors of severe head injury. 
3	Xenon-enhanced computed tomographic measurement of cerebral blood flow in patients with chronic subdural hematomas. We compared clinical symptoms with extent of brain shift on computed tomographic (CT) scans and quantitative and three-dimensional measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on xenon-enhanced CT scans in 10 patients with chronic subdural hematomas. Five patients had only headache and minimal or no brain shift on a CT scan. The other five had hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance in addition to headache and moderate or severe brain shift on a CT scan. The mean hemispheric CBF decreased about 7% in patients with headache and about 35% in patients with hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance. It decreased also on the side without the hematoma. The CBF reduction was always more pronounced in the putamen and thalamus than in the cortex. On the contrary, the cortex CBF was mostly preserved or even elevated in both groups of patients. We speculate that CBF reduction in patients with a chronic subdural hematoma occurs initially in central cerebral areas like the basal ganglia and thalamus, and then extends to the entire hemisphere including the cortex as brain compression and displacement progress. Central cerebral area involvement might be more responsible for clinical symptoms than the cortex. 
2	Scintigraphic measurement of oropharyngeal transit in man. Scintigraphic studies of the oropharyngeal transit of a liquid bolus were performed in 15 healthy controls, 12 patients with symptoms of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia, and 13 patients with neuromuscular disease, who did not have dysphagia. Gamma camera imaging of the head, neck, and upper thorax was undertaken, in the lateral projection, during the swallowing of the radiolabeled bolus of water. Inspection of summed images permitted the selection of regions of interest (ROI) to represent the mouth, pharynx, and upper esophagus. Transit times between each ROI were calculated and compared. Significant prolongation of bolus transit time between the mouth and esophagus was present in both patients with and without dysphagia (0.59 +/- 0.38 sec and 0.33 +/- 0.7 sec; mean +/- SD, respectively) compared with controls (0.26 +/- 0.04 sec P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Repeat studies in 25 individuals indicated that the transit measurements were more reproducible between swallows in normal subjects than in patients with symptoms. Deglutitive scintigraphy provides a noninvasive technique for the quantitative study of swallowing and its disorders. 
3	Refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. We describe a case of severe refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication. A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal disease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The patient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia refractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate concentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied by rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory hypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin. Salicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization, resulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on hypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate. 
5	Coronary collateral recruitment: functional significance and relation to rate of vessel closure. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the anatomic presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. The extent of collateralization varies among species and among individuals. Collateral vessels are usually adequate for preserving resting regional and global ventricular function in the face of coronary obstruction. During stress, however, collateral supply may be inadequate. Collateral development is a time-dependent process during both the initial occlusion and following transient reflow and reclosure. Therefore when a previously collateralized coronary occlusion is recanalized and then recloses, the extent of the resulting collateral recruitment will depend, at least in part, upon the period of reflow between the two occlusions. The longer the reflow period, the less enhanced will be the collateralization. This is illustrated in the cases presented and has also been demonstrated in animal studies. The exact mechanisms for this recurrent collateral recruitment need further study. 
5	Early inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after trans-sphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a rare but life-threatening complication of trans-sphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy. It has previously only been described as a late phenomenon. We report an early presentation within the first week. The pathophysiology, clinical features and treatment are discussed. 
1	Intrarectal ultrasonography in rectal cancer staging and in the evaluation of pelvic disease. Clinical uses of intrarectal ultrasound. Accurate preoperative staging of a rectal cancer patient may impact heavily on subsequent management. This study attempts to evaluate the accuracy of intrarectal ultrasonography (IRUS) in staging rectal cancers compared to clinical and pathologic examination. In addition the accuracy of IRUS was assessed in a group of patients with uncertain pelvic-perirectal disease after a negative physical examination. In a prospective manner, 52 cancer patients were staged with digital exam and IRUS. Accuracy rates were 48% and 83%, respectively, compared to pathologic evaluation in assessing wall penetration, and IRUS identified positive lymph nodes in 12 of 17 cases. In patients with pelvic disease, IRUS corresponded with pathologic diagnosis in 15 of 17 cases and revealed new information in 6 patients. Intrarectal ultrasonography appears to be the most accurate imaging technique for staging rectal cancers and demonstrates promise in the evaluation of perirectal-pelvic disease. 
1	Significance and treatment of positive margins or seminal vesicle invasion after radical prostatectomy. The periprostatic soft-tissue involvement described in the older urologic literature differs from that now recognized; a much "earlier" pathologic stage C is being identified. Apparent microscopic extension of the cancer to the margin of the specimen yields an approximately 25% risk of local recurrence. Postoperative radiation apparently is effective in reducing this risk, and if patients are properly selected, such treatment is well tolerated. Whether adjuvant radiation affects overall survival is not known. New observations on pathologic extension of the disease need to be refined. 
4	CR leads in cardiac emergencies. A preliminary study. The purpose of this study was to find a set of simplified electrocardiographic (ECG) leads that would be useful in cardiac emergencies. In 27 ambulatory cardiac patients and in 15 patients admitted to the hospital, we found that ECG records obtained with six bipolar CR leads were, in most respects, similar to records obtained previously in the same patients with six V leads. Records obtained with two abdominal-upper extremity leads, tested as possible alternatives to limb leads 2 and 3, were quite similar to records obtained with leads 2 and 3 in patients with an inferior wall infarction. Records obtained with leads CR7, CR8, and CR9 in a patient with a posterior wall infarction revealed a QS pattern that was not seen in the conventional 12-lead hospital record. In patients with anterolateral and inferior myocardial infarctions and in patients with unstable angina, the diagnostic patterns recorded with 11 bipolar leads described in this report were identical to patterns recorded with 12-lead ECGs. Although a larger number of observations, including patients with arrhythmias, would be required to reach a definitive conclusion, our results provide preliminary evidence that cardiac potentials may be adequately analyzed by using only two electrodes, using CR and abdominal leads, in succession. The technique described in this report, in which the reference electrode is attached to the right arm, and the exploring electrode is moved successively over nine preselected chest sites and over the umbilicus, can be completed in less than 3 minutes in a given patient, and provides records that are comparable to those obtained with the conventional 12-lead system. 
4	Long-term results of catheter ablation of idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia Ten consecutive patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic, idiopathic, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating in the right ventricle underwent an attempt at catheter ablation of the ventricular tachycardia. There were seven women and three men, with a mean age of 39 +/- 14 years (+/- SD). None of the patients had any evidence of structural heart disease. The VT had a left bundle branch block configuration and an inferior axis in each patient, and the mean cycle length was 313 +/- 75 msec. Based on the methods of induction of the VT and the response of the VT to verapamil, the VT mechanism was presumed to be reentry in six patients, triggered activity in three patients, and catecholamine-sensitive automaticity in one patient. Sites for ablation were guided by pace mapping, and an appropriate target site was identified in the right ventricular outflow tract in each patient. From one to three shocks of 100-360 J (mean total, 336 +/- 195 J) were delivered from a defibrillator between the tip of the ablation catheter (cathode) and a patch electrode on the anterior chest (anode). An electrophysiology test 7-9 days after ablation demonstrated that VT was still inducible in only one patient, who was treated with amiodarone. One other patient had a recurrence of VT 3 weeks after ablation and was treated with verapamil. Eight of 10 patients were not treated with antiarrhythmic medications and have had no episodes of symptomatic VT during 15-68 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 33 +/- 18 months). There were no acute or long-term complications. 
1	The use of L-dopa and carbidopa in metastatic malignant melanoma. A combination of L-dopa and carbidopa was given orally to 17 patients with metastatic melanoma. Maximum tolerated oral doses were given, up to 4 grams daily. No response was seen in 15 patients evaluable for response. Toxicity was considerable, with seven of 17 patients (41%) stopping treatment because of unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity or postural hypotension. Contrary to previous anecdotal reports, there was no evidence that L-dopa/carbidopa treatment resulted in accelerated progression of metastatic melanoma. Orally administered L-dopa/carbidopa is ineffective as therapy for advanced melanoma when maximum tolerated doses are used. 
1	Benign cystic teratoma manifested as an umbilical hernia. We have reported a case of dermoid tumor manifested as an umbilical hernia. Resection led to complete recovery. 
1	Management of primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval thrombus. We report our experience with the management of 7 primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval tumor thrombus. Included are 3 cases of adrenal cortical carcinoma and 1 each of transitional cell carcinoma, embryonal cell testicular carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and primary small cell carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the kidney. Surgical treatment and followup are presented, as well as a review of the literature. An aggressive surgical approach is warranted because prolonged survivals free of disease are possible. 
5	A comparison of induction and maintenance therapy for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in childhood: results of a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Two hundred fifty-six children with previously untreated acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were evaluated on a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) phase III randomized trial of both induction and continuation chemotherapies. Induction therapy compared vincristine, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (VADx) with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine (DAT). The complete remission (CR) rate using DAT was superior (82% v 61%, P = .02). Postremission therapy consisted of either "standard" two-cycle therapy or a more intensive four-cycle regimen given for 2 years. Overall, there was no difference in outcome for patients randomized to either continuation regimen. The overall complete continuous remission rate (CCR) for the "best" induction/continuation therapy combination at 2 years was .50 (SE = .06), at 3 years was .35 (.04), and at 4 years was .34 (.05). Analysis of selected clinical and laboratory parameters demonstrated differences in induction responses favoring DAT induction but did not impact eventual disease-free survival. There were two subgroups of patients who responded better to four-cycle continuation therapy. These were patients with French-American-British (FAB) M1/M2 (2-year CCR was .20 v .44, P = .01) and patients older than 10 years at diagnosis (.32 v .62, P = .004). 
5	Adjunctive use of beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists and other therapies in coronary thrombolysis. The availability of thrombolytic agents for use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is an important step in the management of a common, often debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder. However, despite the proven benefits of coronary thrombolysis, the importance of adjunctive treatment modalities is being increasingly recognized. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, nitrates, magnesium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors each exert favorable cardiovascular properties that may offer additional benefits. Clinical trials combining thrombolytic and adjunctive pharmacologic agents offer hope for further advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. 
4	Angiographic contrast media interference with laser-induced fluorescence excitation and detection in atherosclerotic human coronary arteries. Laser-induced fluorescence has been used in conjunction with angiography for laser angioplasty guidance. The effect of radiopaque contrast media on the excitation and detection of arterial fluorescence has not been previously reported. Accordingly, fluorescence emission spectra from human coronary artery necropsy specimens (n = 7) during excitation with pulsed excimer laser excitation (308 nm) was examined before and after the addition of three different contrast media, sodium and meglumine diatrizoate, sodium and meglumine ioxaglate, and iopamidol. A decrease in overall fluorescence intensity was observed at all wavelengths for each contrast agent examined. The decrease in intensity of fluorescence emission was more marked at wavelengths less than 410 nm than at wavelengths above 425 nm. Similar effects were observed for contrast media diluted with whole blood. Absorption spectra for all three contrast media demonstrated absorption in the ultraviolet centered around 240 nm. We conclude that preferential absorption in the ultraviolet range by contrast media interferes with the excitation and detection of laser-induced fluorescence; use of visible light excitation may obviate interference with laser-induced fluorescence analysis of plaque. 
2	The role of sphincteroplasty for fecal incontinence reevaluated: a prospective physiologic and functional review. Sixteen female patients (mean age 54.1 years; range 34-74 years) with a 9.8-year (range 1-25 years) history of incontinence to solid stool underwent overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication without fecal diversion. All patients were prospectively evaluated with preoperative anorectal manometry, electromyography, and pudendal nerve motor latency assessment, postoperative anorectal manometry, and preoperative and postoperative functional evaluation. Mean and maximal resting pressures increased from 30 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg preoperatively to 40 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively. Likewise, mean and maximal squeeze pressures increased from 27 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg preoperatively to 39 mm Hg and 73 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, anal canal high pressure zone length was increased by sphincteroplasty from a mean of 0.9 cm (range 0-3 cm) to a mean of 2.1 cm (range 1-4 cm). These objective physiologic improvements correlated well with subjective functional improvement. Subjectively, functional outcome was rated by patients as excellent in 38 percent, good in 38 percent, fair in 19 percent, and poor in only 5 percent of cases. Overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication improves both the anal sphincter physiologic profile and fecal continence. 
5	Italian experience of voice restoration after laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal puncture. This report concerns 102 cases of tracheoesophageal puncture performed as a means of secondary voice restoration after total laryngectomy, in 70 patients proving unable to learn esophageal speech and as a treatment of choice in a further 32 cases. Complications arose in 21 cases but were generally minor and could be overcome. Results were favorable in 45 of 70 and 29 of 32 cases, respectively. The method was considered effective, particularly when supported by the patient's determination to learn a verbal communication method. 
2	Transient renal acidification defect during acute infantile diarrhea: the role of urinary sodium. We studied urinary acidification daily during the hospital course of 16 infants with acute gastroenteritis and metabolic acidosis. Urine pH value on admission was higher than 5.5 in 14 (87%) patients. We hypothesized that inappropriate urinary acidification was due to sodium deficiency and inadequate sodium delivery to the distal nephron. Forty-one urinary samples were collected during metabolic acidosis. The mean pH of 24 urine samples with sodium concentration less than 10 mmol/L was significantly higher than the pH of 17 samples with sodium concentration greater than 10 mmol/L (6.04 +/- 0.06 vs 5.19 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). The urine ratios of titratable acid to creatinine and of total acidity to creatinine were significantly higher in urine samples containing more sodium (p less than 0.02), whereas the ammonium/creatinine ratio was not. After administration of furosemide or correction of the sodium deficit, appropriate acidification was observed. We conclude that impaired urinary acidification is frequently found during metabolic acidosis in infants with acute gastroenteritis and results from a sodium deficit rather than from transient distal renal tubular acidosis. 
5	Intra-arterial urokinase as the initial therapy for acutely ischemic lower limbs Acute ischemia of the lower limb remains a significant risk to both life and limb. Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience, which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients), has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases, thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery, usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach, diminished the overall need for surgery, and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia. 
5	Passive immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantation in HBsAg-positive patients. 110 HBsAg-positive patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and received long-term anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) passive immunoprophylaxis with anti-HBs immunoglobulin. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft. Long-term passive anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis significantly reduced HBV reinfection and improved survival in patients without evidence of active HBV replication before orthotopic liver transplantation. 
2	Nonmucous glycoproteins as pronucleating agents. Cholesterol crystallization-promoting factors probably play an important role in the pathogenesis of gallstone disease. We have isolated one of the factors involved by using lectin-affinity chromatography. A potent promoting activity binds to concanavalin A-Sepharose. The activity is heat labile and sensitive to digestion by glycosidase but remarkably insensitive to proteases. The concanavalin A-binding pronucleator affects cholesterol solubilization in model bile in two ways. It induces a shift of cholesterol and phospholipid from the micellar to the vesicular phase but also interacts directly with cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles. The concanavalin A-binding protein fraction contains at least two different promoting factors with gel permeation molecular weights of about 150 kD and 5 kD, respectively. The higher molecular weight activity could be assigned to a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 130 kD. Concanavalin A-binding-promoting activity was present in bile from both patients with and without stones, indicating that it is a normal constituent of bile. However, the activity was strongly increased in bile from patients with multiple cholesterol gallstones, suggesting that it could play a key role in gallstone formation in these patients. 
4	Antihypertensive effectiveness of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system in the elderly. The Modern Approach to the Treatment of Hypertension (MATH) Study Group. The Modern Approach to the Treatment of Hypertension (MATH) trial was conducted to determine the therapeutic safety and efficacy of the once-a-day nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation in a large and diverse cohort of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. One of the goals of the MATH study was to evaluate the clinical utility of nifedipine GITS in elderly hypertensives. This analysis compares the safety and efficacy of nifedipine GITS in elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years of age) and nonelderly patients (adults less than 65 years of age). A total of 222 elderly and 933 nonelderly patients from 127 centers were evaluated. Following a 2 week placebo washout phase, patients were titrated over 1 to 6 weeks on nifedipine GITS 30 to 180 mg/day, increasing in 30 mg increments to achieve goal blood pressure, defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and a 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline. Therapy was maintained at the optimal dose for an additional 12 weeks. Hemodynamic and laboratory parameters were assessed at baseline and at the final treatment visit. Baseline parameters were comparable between patient groups except for systolic blood pressure, which was significantly greater in the elderly compared with nonelderly patients (164 +/- 18 v 150 +/- 14 mm Hg, respectively, P less than .0001). After 12 weeks of therapy with nifedipine GITS, sitting and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased from baseline for both elderly and nonelderly patients. 
1	Cystic tumors of the pancreas. New clinical, radiologic, and pathologic observations in 67 patients. Within a 12-year period we treated 67 patients (49 women, 18 men; mean age, 61 years) with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, including 18 serous cystic adenomas, 15 benign mucinous cystic neoplasms, 27 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 3 papillary cystic tumors, 2 cystic islet cell tumors, and 2 cases of mucinous ductal ectasia. Mean tumor size was 6 cm (2 to 16 cm). In 39% the patients had no symptoms, and in 37% the lesions had been misdiagnosed as a pseudocyst. Computed tomography was useful for detection, for distinguishing the microcystic subgroup of serous cystadenoma, and for showing rim calcification (all 7 cases were malignant) but was not reliable for distinguishing neoplasm from pseudocyst, serous from mucinous tumors, or benign from malignant. Arteriography showed hypervascularity in 4 of 10 serous adenomas, 3 of 11 mucinous carcinomas, and 1 of 1 papillary cystic tumors. Endoscopic pancreatography showed no communication with the cyst cavity in 37 of 37 cases of cystic neoplasms but opacified the ectatic ducts in 2 of 2 cases of mucinous ductal ectasia. Stenosis or obstruction of the pancreatic duct indicated cancer. The tumor was resected by distal pancreatectomy in 25 patients, by proximal resection in 29, and by total pancreatectomy in one, with no operative deaths. Forty-four per cent of the tumors were malignant. In 10 cases the tumor was unresectable because of local extension or distant metastases, and those patients died at a mean of 4 months. Seventy-five per cent of those resected for cure are alive without evident recurrence. Because the epithelial lining of the tumor was partially (5% to 98%) absent in 40% to 72% of cases of the major tumor types, and the mucinous component comprised only about 65% of mucinous cystadenoma lining, misdiagnoses on frozen and even permanent sections were made. Mitoses and histologic solid growth correlated with malignancy. Neuroendocrine elements were seen in 87% of benign and 47% of malignant mucinous tumors. It is recommended that the terms macrocystic and microcystic be abandoned in favor of the histologic designations serous and mucinous. Incomplete examination of the cyst wall can be misleading, however. It is suggested that mucinous ductal ectasia be recognized separately from cystic tumors and that all of these lesions be resected, with the possible exception of asymptomatic confirmed serous cystadenomas. 
3	Relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. Based on the 242 consecutive surviving head injury cases and 132 general trauma cases, this study examined the contribution of brain and non-brain injuries to cognitive and psychosocial outcome 1 month postinjury. The study also examined the relationships among various head injury severity indices. The head injury severity indices were all correlated but patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the mild range had broadly ranging scores on the other head injury severity indices (Abbreviated Injury Scale and time to follow commands). Neuropsychological outcome was related to brain injury severity, but was not independently influenced by severity of other systems injuries. Psychosocial outcome related to both brain and non-brain injuries independently. When evaluating trauma outcome, it is important to consider the contributions of both brain and other system injuries. 
2	Does paramedic-base hospital contact result in beneficial deviations from standard prehospital protocols? We reviewed written and audio records of paramedic-base hospital radio contact to determine whether care differed from that suggested in standard prehospital care protocols. Records of all 659 contacts for seizure, syncope, abdominal pain, or altered mental state during 1987 (28.4% of all contacts) were scored for the use of standard therapies (such as intravenous access, oxygen, naloxone hydrochloride) and unanticipated therapies (intubation, nitroglycerin). Cases that involved unanticipated treatments were reviewed to determine whether they could have been prospectively identified by simple clinical findings. Standard therapies were used in the majority of patients. Unanticipated therapies were administered to 13 patients, all of whom had abnormal vital signs, diaphoresis, respiratory distress, or a second prominent symptom. Data suggest that protocols could replace radio contact for most patients and that the few who might benefit from radio contact can be easily identified. A 90% reduction in radio contacts in Los Angeles county could save $3 million each year. 
4	Dipyridamole magnetic resonance imaging: a comparison with thallium-201 emission tomography. Limitation of space and motion artefact make magnetic resonance imaging during dynamic exercise difficult. Pharmacological stress with dipyridamole can be used as an alternative to exercise for thallium scanning. Forty patients with a history of angina and an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram were studied by dipyridamole thallium myocardial perfusion tomography and dipyridamole magnetic resonance wall motion imaging with a cine gradient refocused sequence. Images for both scans were obtained in the oblique horizontal and vertical long axis and short axis planes before and after pharmacological stress with dipyridamole. The myocardium was divided into nine segments for direct comparison of perfusion with wall motion. Segments were assessed visually into grades--normal, hypokinesis or reduced perfusion, and akinesis or very reduced perfusion. After dipyridamole there were reversible wall motion abnormalities in 24 (62%) of 39 patients with coronary artery disease and 24 (67%) of 36 patients with reversible thallium defects. The site of wall motion deterioration was always the site of a reversible thallium defect. Thallium defects affecting more than two segments were always associated with wall motion deterioration but most single segment thallium defects were undetected by magnetic resonance imaging. There was a significant correlation between detection of wall motion abnormality, the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease, and the induction of chest pain by dipyridamole. There were no significant differences in ventricular volume or ejection fraction changes after dipyridamole between the groups with and without detectable reversible wall motion changes but the normalised magnetic resonance signal intensity of the abnormally moving segments was significantly less than the signal intensity of the normal segments. 
4	Follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of native coarctation in neonates and infants. The purpose of this study is to present intermediate-term results of balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctation in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. During a 60-month-period that ended in January 1990, 19 infants ages 3 days to 12 months (median, 2.5 months), underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 39 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 11 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm to 4.7 +/- 1.0 mm. None required immediate surgical intervention. Thirteen of the 19 (68%) had severe associated cardiac defects. There was one death (5%) 2 days after balloon angioplasty, and it was related to associated cardiac defect. One infant was lost to follow-up. It is too soon to restudy one infant. The remaining 16 infants had clinical (36 +/- 18 months) and catheterization (12 +/- 4 months) follow-up data. The residual coarctation gradient (22 +/- 15 mm Hg) and coarcted segment size (4.4 +/- 1.6 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.01) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values. Five of the 16 (31%) infants (four were neonates at the time of balloon angioplasty) had evidence for recoarctation (defined as gradient greater than 20 mm Hg) and underwent surgical resection (two) or repeat balloon angioplasty (three), all with success. None developed aneurysms. 
3	Acute subdural hematoma: morbidity, mortality, and operative timing. Traumatic acute subdural hematoma remains one of the most lethal of all head injuries. Since 1981, it has been strongly held that the critical factor in overall outcome from acute subdural hematoma is timing of operative intervention for clot removal; those operated on within 4 hours of injury may have mortality rates as low as 30% with functional survival rates as high as 65%. Data were reviewed for 1150 severely head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 3 to 7) treated at a Level 1 trauma center between 1982 and 1987; 101 of these patients had acute subdural hematoma. Standard treatment protocol included aggressive prehospital resuscitation measures, rapid operative intervention, and aggressive postoperative control of intracranial pressure (ICP). The overall mortality rate was 66%, and 19% had functional recovery. The following variables statistically correlated (p less than 0.05) with outcome; motorcycle accident as a mechanism of injury, age over 65 years, admission GCS score of 3 or 4, and postoperative ICP greater than 45 mm Hg. The time from injury to operative evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma in regard to outcome morbidity and mortality was not statistically significant even when examined at hourly intervals although there were trends indicating that earlier surgery improved outcome. The findings of this study support the pathophysiological evidence that, in acute subdural hematoma, the extent of primary underlying brain injury is more important than the subdural clot itself in dictating outcome; therefore, the ability to control ICP is more critical to outcome than the absolute timing of subdural blood removal. 
1	Human basophils express interleukin-4 receptors. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a multipotential lymphokine reputed to play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, interacts with a variety of hemopoietic target cells through specific cell surface membrane receptors. The present study was designed to investigate whether human basophils express IL-4 binding sites. For this purpose, basophils were enriched to homogeneity (93% and 98% purity, respectively) from the peripheral blood of two chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) donors using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement. Purified basophils bound 125I-radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-4 in a specific manner. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity IL-4 binding sites (280 +/- 40 sites per cell in donor 1 and 640 +/- 45 sites per cell in donor 2) with an apparent dissociation constant, kd, of 7.12 x 10(-11) +/- 2.29 x 10(-11) and 9.55 +/- 3.5 x 10(-11) mol/L, respectively. KU812-F, a human basophil precursor cell line, was found to express a single class of 810 to 1,500 high affinity IL-4 binding sites with a kd of 2.63 to 5.54 x 10(-10) mol/L. No change in the numbers or binding constants of IL-4 receptors was found after exposure of KU812-F cells to rhIL-3 (a potent activator of basophils) for 60 minutes. No effect of rhIL-4 on 3H-thymidine uptake, release or synthesis of histamine, or expression of basophil differentiation antigens (Bsp-1, CD11b, CD25, CD40, CD54) on primary human CGL basophils or KU812-F cells was observed. 
5	The interspinous method of posterior atlantoaxial arthrodesis. Thirty-six patients underwent C1-2 posterior wiring and fusion procedures over a 5-year period for unstable C-2 fractures (eight cases), unstable atlas-axis combination fractures (six cases), rheumatoid C1-2 instability (14 cases), os odontoideum (four cases), traumatic C1-2 ligamentous instability (three cases), or instability secondary to a C-2 tumor (one case). In each case, the atlantoaxial arthrodesis utilized sublaminar wire at C-1 and incorporated an iliac-crest strut-graft positioned between the posterior arches of C-1 and C-2, held in place by securing wire around the base of the spinous process of the axis. Follow-up examination was performed in all patients after a mean postoperative duration of 33.7 months. The technical aspects and clinical merits of this fusion procedure, which led to a 97% union rate (one nonunion) and minimal morbidity and mortality rates, are presented. 
1	Diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of care for seborrheic keratoses. A pilot study of an approach to quality assurance for cutaneous surgery In 1985 there were more than 40 million visits for ambulatory surgical procedures in the United States. Although benign cutaneous lesions are among the most frequent conditions to receive surgical treatment in ambulatory settings, their treatment is seldom subject to peer review. In this pilot study we assessed diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of care using information available from the surgical pathology laboratory. We assessed these two measures of physician performance for 527 seborrheic keratoses removed by 133 clinicians affiliated with four different institutions. Overall, a correct preoperative diagnosis was provided in only 49% of cases. Dermatologists had the highest diagnostic accuracy (61% vs 35% for all other physicians). An appropriate procedure for the actual pathological diagnosis was performed in only 50% of cases. Lesions with a correct preoperative diagnosis were more than eight times more likely to receive appropriate care. Our data suggest that many clinicians fail to note a correct diagnosis of common cutaneous lesions before surgical removal, and many patients are treated with procedures that are more invasive than necessary for the final pathological diagnosis. Because the approach used in this pilot study relies on data already available, it has promise as a low-cost method of monitoring the quality of care of ambulatory surgery. 
5	Choreoathetosis after deep hypothermia without circulatory arrest In 8 of 758 patients undergoing an intracardiac operation under cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia, choreoathetosis developed 3 to 7 days postoperatively. Before the onset of choreoathetosis, varying degrees of neurological dysfunction were noted. Electroencephalography and neuroimaging failed to detect any responsible functional or structural changes. Six patients are alive 1 to 3 years postoperatively, and their condition is improving. Two patients died of aspiration or sepsis. All patients were grouped based on factors identified as being possibly causative: depth of hypothermia, cooling time, flow rate, and repeated hypothermia. The incidence of choreoathetosis was significantly different in group A (rectal temperature greater than 25 degrees C) compared with group B (rectal temperature less than or equal to 25 degrees C) (0/295 versus 8/463; p = 0.02). Based on cooling time, the incidence of choreoathetosis was significantly different in group B1 (cooling time less than 1 hour) compared with group B2 (cooling time greater than or equal to 1 hour) (1/220 versus 7/243; p = 0.05). Based on flow rate during cooling, group B2 was further divided into the low-flow group (less than 1,500 mL.min-1.m-2) and the high-flow group (greater than or equal to 1,500 mL.min-1.m-2). Although not significant, the incidence of choreoathetosis was higher in the high-flow group (6/153 versus 1/90; p = 0.22). In group B patients having reoperation, the incidence of choreoathetosis was higher than in patients operated on for the first time (5/54 versus 3/409; p less than or equal to 0.0001). 
3	Intradural chordoma of the tentorium cerebelli. Case report. A rare case of intradural chordoma is described. The literature contains seven examples of intradural extraosseous chordoma, all reported in a ventral location. This is the first reported case of a primary intradural chordoma distant from the clivus and involving both the supra- and infratentorial compartments. 
1	The gastrin hypothesis. Implications for antisecretory drug selection. Newer potent and long-acting inhibitors of acid secretion, such as the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, are becoming available for general use. These drugs promise to control acid-peptic disease effectively in patients who do not respond adequately to conventional short-acting H2-receptor antagonists. The safety of chronic administration of these drugs has come into question, however. Lifelong profound inhibition of acid secretion in rats induced by superpotent inhibitors of acid secretion or subtotal fundectomy is associated with the development of carcinoid tumors of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric corpus. Available evidence supports a role of gastrin, which becomes chronically elevated in animals subjected to prolonged and profound hypochlorhydria. In humans, hypergastrinemic states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and atrophic gastritis are associated with an increased risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors. Such observations have raised concern that humans may also be susceptible to carcinoid tumor formation in response to potent inhibitors of acid secretion. To date, however, no cases of carcinoid tumor have been attributed to the use of omeprazole in humans. If achlorhydric doses are not used, significant hypergastrinemia can be avoided while effectiveness of treatment is maintained. Such measures should minimize any risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors in humans taking potent long-term antisecretory drugs. 
2	The Baltimore experience with laparoscopic management of acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has rapidly emerged as a popular alternative to traditional laparotomy and cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis has been considered to be a relative or absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. After gaining extensive experience in laparoscopic biliary tract surgery, this procedure was attempted in 15 patients with acute cholecystitis. All patients were operated on within 72 hours of admission. In five patients, the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open laparotomy; in one patient, a localized abscess was found, and in the other four patients, extensive inflammation and edema precluded a safe dissection of the vascular and ductal structures. Laparoscopic cholangiography was performed in 14 patients and proved valuable in demonstrating the ductal anatomy. Patients were discharged an average of 2.7 days after the laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed by experienced surgeons in patients with acute cholecystitis. To ensure a low complication rate, a low threshold for converting the procedure to an open laparotomy must be maintained if the ductal and vascular anatomy cannot be safely demonstrated. 
4	Extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with a tortuous portal vein. Portal vein aneurysm is rare and its etiology is controversial. A case of extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with an unusually tortuous portal vein is described. Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches. This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size. Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them. The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system. 
3	Early-onset dementia and extrapyramidal disease: clinicopathological variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker or Alzheimer's disease? A case of progressive dementia and extrapyramidal signs beginning at age 29, with a ten year course until death, is presented. Necropsy examination showed an assortment of plaque types (including striatal plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration, and depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. This case had pathological features found in both Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and in Alzheimer's disease. While somewhat similar to several other cases with features of both diseases, it differs in the presence of dystonia and striatal plaques. Although such cases may be difficult to categorize at present, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset dementia. 
5	Epithelial dysfunction in nonbacterial cystitis (interstitial cystitis). Traditional concepts of impermeability of the bladder have centered around unique cellular tight junctions and ion pumps. However, recent data from our laboratory have shown that the bladder epithelium in animals and humans relies primarily on its surface glycosaminoglycans to maintain its impermeability. This study demonstrates the first disease associated with an epithelial dysfunction of the bladder, that is a leaky epithelium. The study consisted of 31 normal subjects and 56 individuals with interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis patients were shown to have a leaky epithelium by placing a solution of concentrated urea into the bladder and measuring the absorption. The normal subjects absorbed 4.3% in 45 minutes, while the interstitial cystitis patients absorbed 25% (difference is highly significant, p less than 0.005). Interstitial cystitis patients with Hunner's ulcers (10) had a 34.5% absorption rate, while those without ulcers absorbed 22.8% (46). This difference also was highly significant (p = 0.002) and supports the concept that patients with ulcers have clinically worse disease. 
5	Observer variability in the scoring of colpophotographs. Colposcopy and cervicography are accepted tools for assessing the cervix for an atypical transformation zone. We studied the validity of the colpophotograph as a measurement tool by determining the agreement of experienced colposcopists using colpophotographs of 50 women. Interobserver agreement was generally fair to good (kappa greater than or equal to 0.40) for the presence of the squamocolumnar junction and the area of ectopia but it was poor (kappa less than 0.40) for the area, border, and color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone. Intra-observer agreement was fair to good for the color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone, but it was poor for the area and border characteristics. We conclude that observer agreement studies should play a role in the validation of methods used in the visual diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Considerable lack of agreement in reporting cytologic findings is a well-known problem, and lack of agreement might be an even bigger problem in reporting colposcopic findings. 
1	Synchronous carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Reports on the incidence of synchronous carcinoma of the colon and rectum have varied from 2 to 11 per cent. The variability is a result of a lack of uniformity in criteria of diagnosis, differences in the population studied and differences in time period used. In this study, we evaluated the incidence and distribution of synchronous lesions during a recent time period before the use of colonoscopy became widespread. We reviewed the records of all patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum who were operated upon at our institution between 1976 and 1981. In a total group of 1,000 patients of which 52 per cent were men, there were 54 patients or 5.4 per cent who had synchronous carcinomas. The group of patients with synchronous carcinomas were older than the group with nonsynchronous carcinomas (72.4 versus 68.8 years). There was also a higher incidence of associated benign polyps in the group with synchronous carcinomas (70 versus 30 per cent for a nonsynchronous carcinomas). The anatomic distribution of carcinomas of the colon and rectum in the group with synchronous lesions (111 in total) revealed a higher percentage of carcinomas located on the right side (29.7 versus 22.5 per cent), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Synchronous carcinomas were located in nonadjacent segments of the colon in 37 per cent. There was no difference in stage between the groups with and without synchronous carcinomas. The preoperative identification of synchronous lesions by either colonoscopy or barium enema is important for the proper treatment of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Failure to locate these tumors may lead to the demise of the patient. 
1	Cessation of treatment in advanced cancer. A major responsibility for all physicians, but particularly for oncologists, is to recognize the time when active antitumor treatment ceases to have a rational basis. The decision to treat or not to treat at any stage of disease requires an analysis of "the legitimate aims of therapy." We have acquired the ability to cure or prolong survival in an increasing proportion of patients with several types of cancer. For patients who fail to achieve those results and for those with tumors that are rarely amenable to specific therapy, the choice of less surely effective therapy is an option; the patient must participate in the decision, armed with as much information and insight as possible, for conventional and experimental treatment. A distinction must be made between specific antitumor therapy and palliative measures for which cessation is never an option. Happily, cessation of treatment must also be considered when therapy has been so successful that the patient has achieved complete remission. At what point may treatment be discontinued without the danger of relapse? These issues are rarely crisply defined, but primary concern for the patient and careful analysis of the available data can lead to appropriate value judgements. 
4	Effects of diltiazem on the functional recovery of the myocardium at organ and cellular level during prolonged hypothermic ischemic cardiac arrest. The effectiveness of diltiazem on the functional recovery of the heart, calcium (Ca++) uptake and binding, Ca++ ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and MB fraction of creatine kinase (MBCK) of coronary sinus blood was investigated after one and a half hours of reperfusion following three hours of ischemic cardiac arrest. The dogs were divided into three groups: group I, sham bypass; group II, cold crystalloid cardioplegia; and group III, cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem. There was a decrease in aortic pressures left ventricular pressure development (dp/dt), left ventricular work index (LVWI), total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR), and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) in the sham bypass group. There was a decrease in cardiac index (CI), LVWI, and mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) and an increase in TSVR and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in group II as compared with group I. Although there was a tendency for a decrease in the indices of myocardial contractility in group II, they were not significantly different from those in group I. The indices of myocardial contractility, CI, and LVWI in group III were slightly higher than in group II, but they were not significantly different from each other. The values for calcium uptake by SR in groups II and III were similar but significantly lower than those in group I. Calcium binding in group III was significantly lower than that in group I. Calcium ATPase of SR in the three groups were similar. Although MBCK increased in all the groups, the increases were not significantly different among the three groups. The results of this study indicate that cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem was not better than cold crystalloid alone in preserving the cardiac contractility and cellular function during prolonged ischemic cardiac arrest. However, the cardiac function in terms of cardiac index was better preserved with diltiazem. 
5	Results of contemporary radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer: a clinicopathological study with an emphasis on the inadequacy of the tumor, nodes and metastases classification. We reviewed 261 patients who underwent a radical operation at a single institution as definitive treatment of invasive bladder cancer to evaluate the survival and accuracy of the tumor, nodes and metastasis system in characterizing the prognosis. Between January 1979 and June 1987 the 261 evaluable patients underwent 1-stage radical cystectomy with pelvic node dissection and urinary diversion. No chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy was given before or after the operation. The postoperative mortality rate was 1.8%. The over-all staging error between clinical and pathological stages was as high as 44%. The over-all actuarial 5-year survival rate was 54.5%. The 5-year survival rates were 75% for stage pT1, 63% for stage pT2, 31% for stage pT3 and 21% for stage pT4 disease. A significant difference in the survival (p less than 0.002) was observed in stage pT3 by dividing tumors confined within the bladder wall (pT3a, 50%) from those extending throughout the bladder wall (pT3b, 15%). A careful evaluation of transitional cell involvement of the prostate in stage pT4a cancer led to the identification of 2 different patterns: 1) contiguous when a bladder tumor extended directly into the prostate through the bladder wall and 2) noncontiguous when a bladder tumor and a transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate were found simultaneously. These patterns had completely different (p less than 0.05) survival rates (6 versus 37%). The patients with high grade tumors had a worse prognosis in comparison with those with grades 1 and 2 tumors (41 versus 56%, p less than 0.005). The over-all 5-year survival of patients with positive nodes was 4% in comparison with 60% of those without nodal involvement (p less than 0.001). Despite current optimal surgical treatment, nearly 50% of all patients with invasive bladder cancer continue to die. The need for a modification of the current tumor, nodes and metastasis tumor classification to provide the clinician a more reliable staging system for planning treatment modalities is indeed mandatory. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine: effective for the clinician or the patient? OBJECTIVES--To test how the results of magnetic resonance imaging influence clinicians' diagnoses and management plans for patients with cranial and spinal problems and to assess changes in the quality of life of these patients. DESIGN--Survey of patients undergoing cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging with questionnaires about diagnoses and intended management plans before and after imaging and quality of life questionnaires at the time of imaging and again four months later. SETTING--Regional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy unit. SUBJECTS--100 consecutive patients referred for cranial imaging in early 1989; 100 similar patients referred for spinal imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in clinicians' leading diagnoses after magnetic resonance imaging and their confidence in these diagnoses; changes in intended management plans; assessment of the contribution to the future management of the patient; changes in patients' quality of life. RESULTS--Magnetic resonance imaging altered the clinicians' leading diagnoses in 35 of 169 (21%) cases. The clinicians became more confident about their leading diagnoses in 90 of 167 (54%). There was a change in management plan in 113 of 182 (62%). The clinicians considered that magnetic resonance imaging made an important contribution to management in 119 of 162 (73%) patients. Overall, the patients' quality of life was unchanged at the four month assessment. CONCLUSIONS--Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with cranial and spinal problems influences clinicians' diagnoses and management plans, but the quality of life of these patients remains unchanged. 
4	Daytime hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea. Prevalence and contributing risk factors. We examined the prevalence of daytime hypertension in a modern sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and assessed the relative risk factors contributing to the development of hypertension in this disorder. Daytime hypertension was present in 92 (45 percent) of 206 male and female patients with OSA. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that only age and body mass index (BMI) were predictors of hypertension in this population. A subsample of 152 male patients with OSA was then compared to 904 men identified from a geographically and ethnically similar general population. When one controlled for age and BMI, the prevalence of hypertension in the two groups was the same except for those aged 25 to 44 years who were markedly obese (BMI greater than 31 kg/m2). In this group, 47 percent of the patients with OSA were hypertensive vs 26 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that the high prevalence of hypertension in OSA is primarily related to age and the excess obesity seen in these patients. In morbidly obese young patients with OSA, factors directly related to OSA may also be contributing to the development of hypertension. With increasing age, other competitive risks may obscure any independent effect that OSA may exert. 
1	Overall mortality and cancer mortality around French nuclear sites Higher than expected mortality from leukaemia has been observed in the population under age 25 living around Sellafield and Dounreay, nuclear reprocessing plants in the United Kingdom. We report the results of a similar study for the population residing around nuclear sites in France. The number of leukaemia deaths was 58, comparable to the 62 in control areas, and slightly less than the 67 expected from national mortality statistics. Twelve deaths due to Hodgkin's disease were observed around nuclear sites; this is about twice the number of Hodgkin's deaths observed in control areas and twice the number expected from national mortality statistics. This observation must, however, be interpreted in light of the fact that several causes of deaths were studied, increasing the play of chance. 
1	Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. 
1	Cancer in relatives of survivors of childhood sarcoma. Relatives of 88 long-term survivors of childhood sarcoma were examined for the familial cancer syndrome of sarcoma, breast cancer, and other neoplasms (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Twenty-six of 402 close relatives developed cancer (expected, 23.8), including breast cancer in four mothers (expected, 3.1). Two sarcoma probands who developed second malignant tumors have multiple relatives with cancer and might have an inherited predisposition. An increased cancer risk and exceptional requirement for disease screening appear to be confined to first-degree relatives of a small fraction of children with sarcoma, notably probands with second cancers. 
4	Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. 
3	Cerebrospinal fluid neopterin in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy. 
2	Treatment of obstructive pneumatosis coli with endoscopic sclerotherapy: report of a case. The case of an 86-year-old man with cardiac and pulmonary failure, in whom pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis caused segmental obstruction of the sigmoid colon is described. The patient was treated with endoscopic puncture and sclerotherapy of the cyst walls in four sessions, giving endoscopic and radiologic regress of the lesions and symptomatic relief. 
1	High grade dysplasia of the gastric mucosa: a marker for gastric carcinoma. The natural history of gastric epithelial dysplasia and its relation to gastric cancer are ill defined. A consecutive series of 40 patients with an initial diagnosis of gastric epithelial dysplasia based on examination of endoscopic biopsies has been reviewed to determine the clinical outcome and to evaluate a two tier histological grading system as a predictor of the risk of cancer. On review, only 20 of the 40 patients were considered to have true dysplasia: seven patients had low grade dysplasia and 13 had high grade dysplasia. Of the 13 patients with high grade dysplasia, 11 (85%) were found to have gastric cancer within 15 months. Of the 10 patients with high grade dysplasia who underwent gastrectomy, six were found to have early gastric cancer, three had cancer invading into the muscularis propria, and none had lymph node metastases. High grade dysplasia is thus a marker of gastric cancer. Moreover, the cancers associated with high grade dysplasia are usually pathologically favourable and curable. The finding, by an experienced pathologist, of high grade dysplasia in two separate sets of endoscopic biopsies is therefore an indication for radical surgical treatment, provided that the patient's age and general condition permit such an approach. 
3	Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a fatal case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developing cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis during pregnancy. The patient was discovered to have SLE at 14 weeks' gestation. Although the symptoms disappeared without treatment with corticosteroid in the 2nd trimester, she presented with meningoencephalitis due to vasculitis in the 3rd trimester. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE. 
5	Femorofemoral bypass: a profile of graft failure. We have reviewed our experience with 71 patients who had a femorofemoral bypass for unilateral iliac artery occlusion or stenosis. We analyzed morbidity, mortality, initial relief of symptoms, early patency, and long-term primary and secondary patency; and we attempted to identify the cause of graft failure. The overall hospital mortality after operative repair was 4%. One-year survival was 84% and 2-year survival was 81%. Early patency was 98.5% at 1 month, late patency was 91% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. The major cause of graft failure was inadequate run-off and outflow disease progression. 
2	Effect of V1-vasopressin receptor blockade on arterial pressure in conscious rats with cirrhosis and ascites. Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin in human cirrhosis with ascites is associated with a significant reduction in arterial pressure, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II plays an important role in the maintenance of systemic hemodynamics in this condition. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether vasopressin also contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhosis with ascites. The study was performed using three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites and three groups of control animals. The administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective antagonist of the vascular effect of vasopressin, to 10 cirrhotic rats induced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 94 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and a significant increase in plasma renin activity (from 24.3 +/- 4.9 to 34.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL.h; P less than 0.02) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 1474 +/- 133 to 2433 +/- 253 pg/mL; P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed following saralasin administration in a second group of 5 cirrhotic rats [mean arterial pressure decreased from 97 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.0001); and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentration increased from 18.4 +/- 5.8 to 40.3 +/- 5.7 ng/mL.h (P less than 0.02) and from 1383 +/- 70 to 2312 +/- 334 pg/mL (P less than 0.05), respectively]. The simultaneous blockade of angiotensin II and vasopressin in a third group of cirrhotic rats resulted in a significantly greater reduction of mean arterial pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). No changes in arterial pressure were observed in the three groups of control rats. These findings indicate that endogenous vasopressin is as important as angiotensin II in the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhotic rats with ascites and support the contention that arterial hypotension is the initial event leading to the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin in this animal model of cirrhosis. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging for ineffectual tarsal tunnel surgical treatment. Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is an entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve beneath the ankle flexor retinaculum. Treatment of TTS consists of surgical release of the retinaculum. The failure rate is 10%-20%. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to evaluate a patient with an unsatisfactory response. MR imaging demonstrated incompleteness of the surgical release of the flexor retinaculum. 
2	Monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites: a variant of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed when (a) the ascitic fluid culture is positive, (b) the ascitic fluid neutrophil count is greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm3 and (c) there is no evident intraabdominal surgically treatable source for infection. Few details are available regarding the variant of ascitic fluid infection in which the culture grows bacteria (pure growth of a single type of organism), but the neutrophil count is less than 250 cells/mm3. In this prospective study of 138 episodes of culture-positive spontaneously infected ascites detected in 105 patients, 44 (31.9%) were episodes of "monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites" compared with 94 (68.1%) episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Seventeen patients had both types of infection. The infection-related mortality and hospitalization mortality were similar between the two groups. Patients with bacterascites appeared to have less severe liver disease. In 62% of bacterascites episodes in which a second paracentesis was performed before any treatment the fluid spontaneously became sterile without development of ascitic fluid neutrocytosis. Thirty-eight percent of patients with bacterascites (who underwent a second paracentesis before treatment was started) progressed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis--sometimes within a few hours. The concentration of the chemoattractant C5a was not decreased in the ascitic fluid of the bacterascites patients; this excludes ascitic fluid C5a deficiency as the explanation of the lack of neutrocytosis. Monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites is a common variant of ascitic fluid infection that may resolve without treatment or may progress to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
4	Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in the etiology and clinical course of hypertension. Patients with untreated hypertension have been shown to be resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and are more hyperinsulinemic and hypertriglyceridemic than matched groups of patients with normal blood pressure. In addition, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been demonstrated in spontaneous hypertensive rats and in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a fructose-enriched diet. The defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in these experimental models can also be shown at the cellular level. Experimental interventions that prevent insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia from developing in fructose-fed rats also greatly attenuate the increase in blood pressure. Since endogenous hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been identified as factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), it is likely that they contribute to the increased prevalence of CAD in hypertensive patients. Antihypertensive treatment may have exacerbated these metabolic abnormalities, which could help explain why it has been difficult to show that lowering blood pressure decreases the risk of CAD. These observations raise the possibility that abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in both the etiology and clinical course of hypertension. 
5	Effects of 1.32-micron Nd-YAG laser on brain thermal and histological experimental data. Considering that the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser should have physicothermal properties close to those of the CO2 laser, a series of experiments were conducted on rat cortex (N = 51). Three laser wavelengths were compared: CO2 laser (10.6 microns), 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, and 1.32-microns Nd-YAG lasers. For each shot, temperature measurements were recorded with an infrared thermographic videocamera. The digitized signals were figured as thermal profiles and temperature developments. Ninety-five shots were correctly studied and analyzed: CO2, N = 29; 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, N = 20; 1.32-microns Nd-YAG, N = 46. The histological lesions produced by these three lasers were compared on animals killed 24 hours (N = 20), 8 days (N = 20), and 30 days (N = 5) after the laser impacts. For equivalent densities of energy, the depth of cortical necrosis was comparable for the CO2 laser (200-250 microns) and the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser (210-260 microns) whatever the date of death; the 1.06-microns Nd-YAG laser shots were responsible for much more important damage (400-550 microns). Because of its important absorption in water and nervous tissue, the authors consider the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser most suitable for neurosurgery, particularly because it is conducted through optic fibers, and therefore is easy to handle during neurosurgical procedures. 
1	Phenotypic relationships of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive prostatic carcinoma. Thirty-one snap-frozen human prostate specimens containing examples of benign hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and invasive carcinoma were analyzed using a panel of 24 antibodies and one lectin. Twenty-seven additional routinely processed radical prostatectomy specimens were studied using selected probes known to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Three probes, anticytokeratin KA4, anti-vimentin V9, and the lectin from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1), demonstrated phenotypic similarities between PIN and invasive carcinoma. Whereas the luminal cells of normal or hyperplastic prostatic epithelium are minimally reactive with KA4 (4%) or UEA-1 (0%) and strongly reactive with anti-vimentin (91%), both the PIN and invasive carcinoma are reactive with KA4 (89% and 93%, respectively) and UEA-1 (96% and 93%, respectively) and minimally reactive with anti-vimentin (15% and 0%, respectively). The increased KA4 staining was shown to be in part due to detection of cytokeratin 19, by using cytokeratin-19-specific antibodies, 4.62 and LP2K. The reasons for the increased expression of this cytokeratin and the decreased expression of vimentin are unclear but seem to indicate a phenotypic relationship between the PIN lesions and invasive carcinoma. 
1	Isolated calcaneal metastasis in a patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma. A 55-year-old woman with a history of Stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma, previously treated with surgery and intracavitary radiation therapy, had an isolated calcaneal metastasis. Normal radiographs led to a delay in the diagnosis of her relapse. An ankle computed tomographic scan finally identified a mass, and the surgical biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis. This is the first reported case of an isolated calcaneal metastasis in endometrial adenocarcinoma to the authors' knowledge. 
4	Percutaneous support devices for high risk or complicated coronary angioplasty. Indications for coronary angioplasty have expanded to include patients with unstable acute ischemic syndromes, severe multivessel coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. Several mechanical approaches have been developed as adjuncts to high risk coronary angioplasty to improve patient tolerance of coronary balloon occlusion and maintain hemodynamic stability in the event of complications. These percutaneous techniques include intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, anterograde transcatheter coronary perfusion, coronary sinus retroperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, Hemopump left ventricular assistance and partial left heart bypass. The intraaortic balloon pump provides hemodynamic support and ameliorates ischemia by decreasing myocardial work; it may be inserted for periprocedural complications or before angioplasty in patients with ischemia or hypotension. Anterograde distal coronary artery perfusion may be accomplished passively through an autoperfusion catheter or by active pumping of oxygenated blood or fluorocarbons through the central lumen of an angioplasty catheter. Synchronized coronary sinus retroperfusion produces pulsatile blood flow via the cardiac veins to the coronary bed distal to a stenosis. Both perfusion techniques limit development of ischemic chest pain and myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflations. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass provides complete systemic hemodynamic support which is independent of intrinsic cardiac function or rhythm and has been employed prophylactically in very high risk patients before coronary angioplasty or emergently for abrupt closure. These and newer support devices, while associated with significant complications, may ultimately improve the safety of coronary angioplasty and allow its application to those who would otherwise not be candidates for revascularization. 
5	An in vitro evaluation of an artificial heart. Interactions between human blood and the Penn State Artificial Heart were examined in vitro to study the effects of various operating conditions on the hematologic response. A dual-loop recirculating flow system that accommodated human blood was developed and blood was subjected for 3 hr to various operating conditions known to alter fluid mechanics in the artificial ventricle. The operating conditions investigated were: 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, 60 beats/min at 30% systolic duration, and 90 beats/min at 50% systolic duration. Quantification of plasma free hemoglobin provided a direct indicator of hemolysis in the flow system. Platelet number and beta-thromboglobulin levels were monitored to investigate thrombotic activity, and levels of complement 3a were measured to examine complement system activation. The system was effective in demonstrating the relative hemolytic properties of the operating conditions. Ninety beats/min induced 37% more hemolysis than 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, and 50% systolic duration induced 32% more hemolysis than 30% systolic duration at 60 beats/min. There were no statistically significant changes in either platelet number or beta-thromboglobulin levels during the 3 hr recirculation period. Increases were seen in complement 3a levels, but these appeared to be surface-induced and not sensitive to the different operating conditions. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the flow system in examining the relative hemolytic properties of the artificial ventricle, and suggest that bulk turbulent stresses may play a more important role than laminar wall shear stresses in mediating blood damage in this artificial ventricle. 
4	Human dose-response relationship for decompression and endogenous bubble formation. The dose-response relationship for decompression magnitude and venous gas emboli (VGE) formation in humans was examined. Pressure exposures of 138, 150, and 164 kPa (12, 16, and 20.5 ft of seawater gauge pressure) were conducted in an underwater habitat for 48 h. The 111 human male volunteer subjects then ascended directly to the surface in less than 5 min and were monitored for VGE with a continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound device over the precordium or the subclavian veins at regular intervals for a 24-h period. No signs or symptoms consistent with decompression sickness occurred. However, a large incidence of VGE detection was noted. These data were combined with those from our previously reported experiments at higher pressures, and the data were fit to a Hill dose-response equation with nonlinear least-squares or maximum likelihood routines. Highly significant fits of precordial VGE incidences were obtained with the Hill equation (saturation depth pressure at which there is a 50% probability of detectable VGE [D(VGE)50] = 150 +/- 1.2 kPa). Subclavian monitoring increased the sensitivity of VGE detection and resulted in a leftward shift [D(VGE)50 = 135 +/- 2 kPa] of the best-fit curve. We conclude that the reduction in pressure necessary to produce bubbles in humans is much less than was previously thought; 50% of humans can be expected to generate endogenous bubbles after decompression from a steady-state pressure exposure of only 135 kPa (11 ft of seawater). This may have significant implications for decompression schedule formulation and for altitude exposures that are currently considered benign. These results also imply that endogenous bubbles arise from preexisting gas collections. 
5	Major cross-country differences in risk of dying for people with IDDM. Diabetes Epidemiology Research International Mortality Study Group. OBJECTIVE: Little is known concerning global differences in the risk of premature death for individuals developing youth-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The Diabetes Epidemiology Research International Study was developed to examine the mortality patterns of four population-based cohorts of IDDM cases from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (n = 1000), Finland (n = 5146), Israel (n = 681), and Japan (n = 1428). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: All subjects were diagnosed as having diabetes, were less than 18 yr old at onset, were taking insulin at the time of hospital discharge, and were diagnosed between 1 January 1965 and 31 December 1979. The living status as of 1 January 1985 was determined. RESULTS: Overall, there were 182 deaths. Life-table analysis revealed that at 20-yr duration of diabetes, 5.5% of the cohort had died in Allegheny County in contrast to only 3.1% in Finland and 4.6% in Israel (P less than 0.01). Follow-up for an additional 3 yr in the United States and Finland revealed major differences in the 30- to 39-yr age-group, with 3.9 times greater premature mortality in the U.S. cohort compared with the Finnish group (overall mortality 2.3 vs. 0.6%, respectively). The Japanese cohort was developed in a somewhat different manner than the other three; therefore, the populations of the U.S., Finland, and Israel were reconfigured to make them directly comparable to that of Japan. The Japanese cohort exhibited markedly higher age-adjusted mortality rates (n/100,000 person-yr of diabetes) than the other three (Japan 681, U.S. 230, Finland 171, and Israel 131). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that young adult IDDM subjects are at an increased risk of premature death, there are differences in the mortality risk across countries, and both the U.S. and Japan have the major problem of an apparently excessive premature death rate among young people who have diabetes. 
4	Fatal fungal pericarditis after cardiac surgery and immunosuppression. The cases of two patients with fulminant pericarditis after cardiac surgery are reported. Both fungal infections developed after rethoracotomy for open-chest cardiac resuscitation and high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. Although the time course of both infections from the inoculation of fungi during rethoracotomy and immunosuppression with glucocorticoids to the lethal outcome was strikingly similar, histopathologic studies disclosed the disparate character of the two fungal pathogens responsible: the yeast Candida albicans and the angiotropic mold Aspergillus fumigatus. 
3	Differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria by DNA-mediated gene transfer in primary fibroblasts. Methylmalonic aciduria can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase apoenzyme (mut) or genes required for the provision of cofactor B12 (cbl). The mut and cbl forms are classically differentiated by somatic cell complementation. We describe a novel method for differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria using DNA-mediated gene transfer of a methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone. Gene transfer of a functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone into mut fibroblasts reconstitutes holoenzyme activity measured by metabolism of [14C]-propionate in culture. Identical gene transfers into cbl fibroblasts have no effect. This method is used for the differential diagnosis of mut and cbl genotypes in cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and is shown to be a facile, sensitive, and specific method for genetic diagnosis. This work establishes the principle of using DNA-mediated gene transfer to identify the genotype of diseases which can result from mutations at several different genetic loci. This type of differential genotypic diagnosis will be particularly important for establishing the applicability of somatic gene therapy in individual patients. 
4	Isolated lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented. Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured. Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned. Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure. Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure. All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some. The indications and attitudes to utilising cardiopulmonary bypass in the evolution of techniques for facilitating single-lung transplantation are reviewed. 
5	Mild hypothermic intervention after graded ischemic stress in rats. We investigated the effect of mild (34 degrees C) postischemic hypothermia on hippocampal neuronal damage in 43 rats as a function of the duration of forebrain ischemia. Two temperatures and two durations were investigated. In two normothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 15) and 12 (n = 10) minutes, respectively. In two hypothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 9) and 12 (n = 9) minutes, respectively, and was followed immediately by the lowering and maintenance of rectal temperature to 34 degrees C for 2 hours. Seven days after the ischemic insult, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were prepared for histologic analysis; the percentage of necrotic neurons among the total neuronal population in selected CA1/2 sectors of the hippocampus was determined. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of necrotic neurons in the central (77.5% versus 55.5%, p = 0.006) and lateral (62.5% versus 38.9%, p=0.005) areas and in the overall CA1/2 sector of the hippocampus (71.8% versus 52.2%, p = 0.008) for the 8-minute hypothermic group compared with the 8-minute normothermic group. In contrast, no differences were detected in any area of the hippocampus between the 12-minute normothermic and the 12-minute hypothermic groups (p = 0.29-0.49). Our data indicate that mild postischemic whole-body hypothermia ameliorates neuronal survival when ischemia lasts 8 minutes but not 12 minutes. 
5	Intravascular laser therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of a new method of treatment, endovascular blood irradiation with He-Ne laser, developed by the authors, was studied in 295 patients with primary acute transmural myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring findings before and after laser irradiation suggested the possibility of preventing sudden death in the acute period of MI owing to the high anti-arrhythmic efficacy of the method with respect to high-grade ventricular arrhythmias. Precodial ECG mapping and serial determination of blood enzyme activities (CPK and MB-CPK) showed that irradiation performed within the first hours of MI development contributed to effective limitation of the infarction area and restricted the spread of the area of myocardial ischemic damage. 
2	Treatment of travelers' diarrhea: ciprofloxacin plus loperamide compared with ciprofloxacin alone. A placebo-controlled, randomized trial OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of loperamide used in combination with ciprofloxacin or ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: United States Army hospital in Egypt. PARTICIPANTS: United States military personnel with travelers' diarrhea (n = 104) during a military exercise in November 1989. Persons who were noncompliant, had bloody diarrhea, or had received antidiarrheal medications before entry into the study were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: All participants with travelers' diarrhea were treated with ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Fifty of these patients were randomly assigned to receive loperamide, a 4-mg first dose and 2 mg for every loose stool (as much as 16 mg/d), and 54 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was isolated from 57% of patients; Shigella and Salmonella, seen in 4% and 2% of patients, respectively, were not common. MAIN RESULTS: After 24 hours, the symptoms of 82% of patients in the ciprofloxacin and loperamide group compared with 67% in the ciprofloxacin and placebo group had improved or fully recovered (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 6.3; P = 0.08). After 48 hours, the symptoms of 90% of both groups had improved or fully recovered. The mean number of stools for those receiving loperamide was not much lower than those who did not receive loperamide after 24 hours (1.9 +/- 0.2 [SE] compared with 2.6 +/- 0.2) or 48 hours (3.1 +/- 0.3 compared with 4.0 +/- 0.3) of treatment (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: In a region where enterotoxigenic E. coli was the predominant cause of travelers' diarrhea, loperamide combined with ciprofloxacin was not better than treatment with ciprofloxacin alone. Loperamide appeared to have some benefit in the first 24 hours of treatment in patients infected with enterotoxigenic E. coli. Both regimens were safe. 
1	The potential role of postoperative hepatic artery chemotherapy in patients with high-risk hepatomas. The relationship between operative findings of hepatoma and the postoperative prognosis was studied to clarify indications for adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy after hepatectomy. The results of adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy using 0.4 mg/kg of doxorubicin and 0.12 mg/kg of mitomycin C and infusion of 5-fluorouracil were reported. One hundred sixty patients who had undergone hepatectomy for hepatoma were studied. In the operative findings of hepatoma, with a surgical margin of less than 10 mm, intrahepatic metastasis, tumor embolus in the second or more proximal branch of the portal vein, or lack of capsule formation related to the prognosis were the risk factors for recurrence. In 132 patients with these risk factors the survival rate of 19 patients with adjuvant arterial chemotherapy was significantly higher than for the 113 patients without it. Adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy thus may be an effective therapy and should be studied prospectively in patients undergoing hepatectomy for high-risk hepatoma. 
5	Hot spots for growth hormone gene deletions in homologous regions outside of Alu repeats. Familial growth hormone deficiency type 1A is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deletion of both growth hormone-1 (GH1) alleles. Ten patients from heterogeneous geographic origins showed differences in restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes in nondeleted regions that flanked GH1, suggesting that these deletions arose from independent unequal recombination events. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from nine of ten patients showed that crossovers occurred within 99% homologous, 594-base pair (bp) segments that flanked GH1. A DNA sample from one patient indicated that the crossover occurred within 454-bp segments that flanked GH1 and contained 274-bp repeats that are 98% homologous. Although Alu repeats, which are frequent sites of recombination, are adjacent to GH1, they were not involved in any of the recombination events studied. These results suggest that length and degree of DNA sequence homology are important in defining recombination sites that resulted in GH1 deletions. 
4	Mechanical cardiopulmonary support for refractory cardiogenic shock. From February 1982 to February 1990, 38 patients (30 male patients and 8 female patients) ranging in age from 10 to 78 years (mean 49.4 years) have been supported with arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at St. Louis University Medical Center as a resuscitative system for cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. All patients were unresponsive to conventional resuscitative measures including an intraaortic balloon pump in 25 patients. Patients were resuscitated in the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization laboratory, or the emergency department. Diagnosis varied from acute myocardial infarctions (12 patients), ischemic disease (15 patients), end-stage cardiomyopathy (7 patients), congenital heart disease (3 patients), or postoperative cardiac transplant graft rejection (1 patient). Three patients could not be resuscitated with ECMO because of low flow, but the remaining 35 (92%) achieved hemodynamic stability with ECMO flows greater than 2 L/min/m2. Duration of support ranged from 0.5 to 130 hours (mean 28 hours). Twenty-four patients were successfully weaned from ECMO support after coronary artery bypass (five patients), cardiac transplantation (two patients), or ventricular assist device insertion (eight patients), or with inotropic support (nine patients). Of the 14 patients not weaned, three were inadequately resuscitated, two had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty while receiving ECMO, and nine were not candidates for further intervention. Nine (24%) patients were discharged and are long-term survivors. Our results indicate that resuscitative ECMO is useful for intervals of 12 to 24 hours and can best be applied with (1) patients younger than 60 years of age; (2) patients having acute events (failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) amenable to surgical intervention; and (3) candidates for cardiac transplantation who could be switched to more sophisticated devices within 12 to 24 hours of ECMO insertion. With these criteria, ECMO, when used as a resuscitative system, can result in increased survival in selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. 
2	Bacteriologic findings with ectopic pregnancy. The fallopian tubes and peritoneum of 27 patients were cultured at the time of salpingotomy/salpingectomy to determine if active tubal infection was the cause of post-operative temperature elevations. Infection was documented in six patients (22%). Previous exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis was documented with 2 endocervical cultures and 17 serum specimens positive for IgG antibody. The culture results, however, did not correlate with the postoperative febrile morbidity. 
3	Maxillofacial surgery and nasal CPAP. A comparison of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Recent reports have indicated, however, that there is a small but significant number of failures related to patient compliance. Primary surgical treatment, which has been uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), has declined because of poor results. A reviewed of UPPP failures has shown that while UPPP eliminated palatal obstruction, it failed to eliminate base of tongue obstruction. Maxillofacial surgery has been reported as treatment of OSAS by correcting base of tongue obstruction. Thirty patients with severe OSAS were evaluated to compare nasal CPAP and maxillofacial surgery. The goal was to determine if our surgical protocol was as effective as nasal CPAP. All patients initially underwent baseline diagnostic polysomnography to document OSAS. A nasal CPAP study was performed to determine the appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure. The patients in this study were using nasal CPAP, but they found it unacceptable as long-term treatment and elected surgery. Maxillofacial surgery consisted of maxillary, mandibular, and hyoid advancement. Polysomnography was performed six months following surgery and compared with the night 2 CPAP results. The parameters included in the investigation were the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), lowest SaO2, number of SaO2 falls below 90 percent, total sleep time (TST), REM sleep percent, stage 3-4 sleep percent, and wake after sleep onset. The mean RDI before treatment was 72.0 (SD 25.7). After completing therapy, the RDI from surgery and CPAP was 8.8 (SD 6.0) and 8.6 (SD 4.1), respectively. The mean low SaO2 prior to treatment was 61.0 (SD 13.5), and the CPAP results and postsurgical results were 86.2 (SD 5.5) and 86.1 (SD 4.2), respectively. An analysis of variance was used to examine the results, and there was no statistical difference between nasal CPAP and surgery for all respiratory variables. 
1	Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide combination as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer: a meta-analytic review. Twenty-three patients with marginally resectable and unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (stages IIIA and IIIB) were treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with two alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m2 intravenously (i.v.) and ifosfamide 3.5 g/m2 i.v., mesna 12 g/m2 was given additionally to prevent drug hematuria. Six of 23 patients (26%) had partial response. Of the seven patients who underwent thoracotomy, two were completely resected, but with macroscopic residual disease. Mean time to progression for the whole group was 7 months. Fifteen patients had progression of disease, with local metastases only in six, and distant metastases in eight. After administering 52 chemotherapy cycles, cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide doses were cut down, as eight of 16 patients required hospitalization for fever during neutropenia nadirs. This two-alkylating (non-cisplatin) regimen, unlike cisplatin-based regimens, was ineffective, and further trials are not recommended. 
5	Mucosal intussusception to avoid ascending cholangitis. Many methods have been devised to prevent ascending cholangitis following Kasai's hepatic portoenterostomy for biliary atresia. To investigate the effectiveness of mucosal intussusception in preventing ascending cholangitis, 20 mongrel dogs were randomized to undergo Roux-en-Y cholecystjejunostomy and common bile duct ligation with or without mucosal intussusception. Aeromonas hydrophila was instilled into the gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial cultures were grown from samples taken from the gallbladders and lower jejunum, and blood chemistry and barium studies were performed. The barium studies showed satisfactory lack of reflux in all ten dogs with mucosal intussusception. Only two of them had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder 3 days after bacterial instillation into the jejunum. All ten dogs in the control group had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder. Our results showed that the mucosal intussusception group had a significantly lower rate of recovery of organisms from the gallbladder compared with the control group when the organisms were instilled into distal intestine (P less than 0.05). The method is worthy of clinical trial as a means of preventing or treating ascending cholangitis. 
1	A report on radiation-induced gliomas. Radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date. The disease that most frequently occasioned radiation therapy has been acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Three more cases are added here, two after irradiation for ALL and one after irradiation for tinea capitis. In a review of the relevant literature, the authors stress the possibility that the ALL-glioma and the retinoblastoma-glioma links point to syndromes in their own right that may occur without radiation therapy. 
5	Variceal rebleeding after portosystemic shunting. Strategies and solutions to a vexing problem. The purpose of this review was to discuss an approach to the treatment of recurrent bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices after portosystemic shunt. From our own clinical experience, as well as that of others, it appears that re-establishment of portal decompression should offer the best chance at long-term survival. Luckily, innovations in angiographic technique have allowed attainment of this goal without the inordinate risk of an operative procedure. However, not all patients' situations will be amenable to such treatment. For some of them, operative decompression of the portal venous system can be carried out in an anatomic area previously untouched. For those patients in whom no decompression is possible, direct endoscopic treatment of the varices will offer an alternative, albeit temporizing, approach. 
3	Detecting lower motor neuron dysfunction of the pharynx and larynx with electromyography. This study assessed the utility of clinical electromyography (EMG) for detecting lower motor neuron (LMN) or upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction affecting the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx. Twenty-nine subjects were examined; their clinical diagnoses included perioperative nerve injury, cerebral infarction, and lateral medullary infarction. Resting activity, motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology, and MUAP recruitment were evaluated in every case. Medical records (excluding EMG data) were analyzed for clinical evidence of LMN or UMN dysfunction in the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx. The diagnosis of LMN dysfunction rested on clinical data consistent with cranial nerve injury, poliomyelitis, Wallenberg syndrome, or unilateral bulbar palsy. Criteria for UMN dysfunction included previous cerebral (not brainstem) infarction or mass lesion or the presence of hemiparesis. Electromyographic abnormalities were significantly associated with LMN dysfunction (p less than .05), but they were not significantly associated with UMN dysfunction. Of the parameters tested, MUAP recruitment was the most sensitive (82%) and specific (92%). 
1	Use of monoclonal antibody KP1 for identifying normal and neoplastic human mast cells. The monoclonal antibody KP1 (CD68) was used to stain normal and neoplastic monocytes and macrophages in routinely processed, paraffin wax embedded tissue: mast cells also exhibited strong, consistent cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Light microscopic findings were corroborated by electron microscopical and immunocytochemical findings. The predominant sites of immunoreactivity were the specific intracytoplasmic granules of the mast cells. All mast cell subtypes--that is, normal and reactive mast cells, such as those in lymph nodes exhibiting chronic non-specific lymphadenitis, and malignant or neoplastic mast cells in various types of mastocytosis--reacted with this antibody. This finding is of diagnostic importance, because mast cell proliferation could be mistaken for histiocyte proliferation. It also supports the hypothesis that mast cells derive from the bone marrow. 
1	Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and Down's syndrome. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. Of 2947 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), treated during three consecutive studies of the Pediatric Oncology Group (1974-1986), 52 (1.8%) had Down's Syndrome (DS). Comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics showed no significant differences in leukocyte count, racial distribution, sex ratio, platelet count, incidence of mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, or percentage of blood or bone marrow blasts for children with ALL with or without Down's Syndrome (DS-ALL or NDS-ALL, respectively). However, children with DS-ALL were slightly older at the time of presentation and had higher hemoglobin values. The relative frequency of each major immunophenotype (early pre-B, pre-B, T, or B) was also comparable for patients with or without DS. For this report, treatment regimens were categorized as either conventional (no consolidation therapy) or intensive. Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of DS, a higher leukocyte count, black race, or age older than 10 years was independently associated with a poorer event-free survival (EFS) for children treated with conventional chemotherapy. However, for the cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy, DS was no longer an independent risk factor. In fact, event-free survival (EFS) was markedly improved to a level comparable with that observed in the children diagnosed as having NDS-ALL. On the other hand, serious toxicity, requiring interruption of treatment, was significantly more frequent in the intensively treated children with DS compared with similarly treated patients with NDS-ALL, although deaths resulting from toxicity occurred infrequently. 
1	Fractionated high dose rate versus low dose rate regimens for intracavitary brachytherapy of the cervix. I. General considerations based on radiobiology. Intracavitary brachytherapy at low dose rate (LDR), often with the addition of external-beam radiotherapy, has long been considered the treatment of choice for carcinoma of the cervix, maximizing acute damage in the treatment volume, whilst minimizing late effects. In recent years, primarily for reasons of convenience and cost, there has been a move towards treatments involving a few fractions at high dose rate (HDR). Using data from cells of human origin cultured in vitro, we make estimates of the doses that, delivered in 2-12 HDR fractions, produce tumour control and early effects equivalent to intracavitary treatments at LDR. We also show that, for situations where the normal-tissue dose responsible for late effects is significantly smaller than the tumour dose, HDR schemes may be devised which, while yielding early killing comparable with that of LDR, should not result in worse late effects. We suggest that this scenario probably applies to treatment of carcinoma of the cervix. 
5	Brachial plexus block with a new local anaesthetic: 0.5 per cent ropivacaine A new local anaesthetic, ropivacaine hydrochloride, was used in a concentration of 0.5 per cent in 32 patients receiving a subclavian perivascular block for upper extremity surgery. One group (n = 15) received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine without epinephrine and a second group (n = 17) received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine with epinephrine in a concentration of 1:200,000. Anaesthesia was achieved in 87 per cent of the patients in both groups in all of the C5 through T1 brachial plexus dermatomes. Motor block was profound with 100 per cent of patients in both groups developing paresis at both the shoulder and hand and 100 per cent developing paralysis at the shoulder. There was a rapid initial onset of sensory block (a mean of less than four minutes for analgesia) with a prolonged duration (a mean of greater than 13 hr of analgesia). The addition of epinephrine did not significantly affect the quality or onset of sensory or motor block. The duration of sensory block was reduced by epinephrine at T1 for analgesia and at C7, C8, and T1 for anaesthesia. The duration of sensory block in the remaining brachial plexus dermatomes as well as the duration of motor block was not effected by epinephrine. There was no evidence of cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity in either group with a mean dose of 2.5-2.6 mg.kg-1 ropivacaine. 
5	The Indian experience with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. A study of 58 consecutive Indian infants operated for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed an accentuated male predominance in the incidence of the disease and far less preoperative hemetemesis as compared to that in their Western counterparts. 'Pyloric tumor' was palpable in 89% of cases. Only 34.5% of these infants were first born. Postoperative vomiting occurred in 13.8% of patients and wound sepsis was not encountered. Air contrast radiography confirmed the diagnosis in clinically doubtful cases. 
4	Quincke's edema, revisited. Angioneurotic edema involving the uvula is sometimes referred to as Quincke's edema. The term angioneurotic edema describes several closely related diseases manifested by recurrent, acute edema of the skin or mucosa. We report a case of uvular edema secondary to food allergy, treated successfully with steroids. A short review of angioneurotic edema and its management is also presented. 
1	Evaluation of tumor progression by repeated fine needle biopsies in prostate adenocarcinoma: modal deoxyribonucleic acid value and cytological differentiation. Repeated fine needle aspiration biopsies of the prostate were taken during a period of 24 months or more from 84 patients with untreated prostate cancer. Serial followup regarding modal deoxyribonucleic acid values and cytological differentiation of the tumor cells was possible in 72 and 78 patients, respectively. During followup the modal deoxyribonucleic acid values in the tumor cells changed towards an increased aneuploidy in 17 patients and the cytological differentiation decreased in 18. These findings of a change in modal deoxyribonucleic acid values and cytological differentiation of prostate cancer cells during the course of untreated patients support the concept of a gradual dedifferentiation of prostate cancer. 
1	Hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of hypersensitivity reactions to teniposide (VM-26), etoposide (VP-16), or both were determined in 108 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with a contemporary regimen of intensive multiagent chemotherapy. Fifty (46%) of the 108 patients had one or more hypersensitivity reactions. The risk of any child having an initial reaction over the cumulative dose range studied was 52% (95% confidence limits, 41% and 63%) for VM-26, compared with 34% (95% confidence limits, 24% and 44%) for VP-16. The risk of having an initial reaction to VM-26 or VP-16 was clearly related to the cumulative dose. This risk peaked at 1500 to 2000 mg/m2 for VM-26 and at 2000-3000 mg/m2 for VP-16. All reactions were Type 1 reactions according to the Gell and Coombs classification, characterized by urticaria, angioedema, flushing, rashes, or hypotension, and 86% of reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 severity according to standard criteria. There was no evidence of increasing clinical severity on repeated rechallenge with premedication, and no deaths occurred. The findings suggested that hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with ALL are more common than previously reported, but only rarely constitute dose-limiting toxicity. 
1	Expression of blood-group antigen A--a favorable prognostic factor in non-small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND. New prognostic factors are needed to guide the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We evaluated the prognostic value of altered expression of ABH blood-group antigens, which has been implicated in the multistep process of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. METHODS. The presence of blood-group antigens was assessed immunohistochemically in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 164 patients who underwent curative surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer from 1980 through 1982. Monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the A and B antigens, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I to detect H antigen. RESULTS. Survival of the 28 patients with blood type A or AB who had primary tumors negative for blood-group antigen A was significantly shorter than that of the 43 patients with antigen A-positive tumors (P less than 0.001) and of the 93 patients with blood type B or O (P = 0.002). The respective median survival times were 15, 71, and 39 months. Disease progressed significantly earlier in the 28 patients with tumors negative for blood-group antigen A than in the antigen A-positive patients (P less than 0.001). Expression of blood-group antigen B or H in tumor cells did not correlate with survival. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis showed that expression of blood-group antigen A in tumor cells added significantly to the prediction of overall survival provided by other known prognostic factors among the patients with blood type A or AB (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. Expression of blood-group antigen A in tumor cells is an important favorable prognostic factor in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. This variable needs to be considered in the design of future trials of therapy. 
4	Adult open heart surgery in New York State. An analysis of risk factors and hospital mortality rates This study analyzes data from New York State's new Cardiac Surgery Reporting System, which contains information about cardiac preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, and hospital discharge. The purposes of the study were to determine the set of significant clinical risk factors and to identify cardiac surgical centers most likely to have serious quality-of-care problems. Significant risk factors for in-hospital death were age, gender, ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction, number of open heart operations in previous admissions, diabetes requiring medication, dialysis dependence, disasters (acute structural defect, renal failure, cardiogenic shock, gunshot), unstable angina, intractable congestive heart failure, left main trunk narrowed more than 90%, and type of operation performed. Four of the 28 hospitals had significantly higher mortality rates than expected, given the risk factors of their patients. Subsequent site visits and medical record reviews confirmed that these facilities had high percentages of quality-of-care problems among cases resulting in mortality. 
5	Hypothalamic or central obesity is associated with an early rise in plasma insulin concentration. Insulin levels in a 7-year-old boy with hyperphagia and obesity following an episode of meningoencephalitis were studied sequentially during the course of progressive weight gain. High fasting insulin levels (1183 pmol/L) and strikingly high insulin release in response to glucose (7892 pmol/L) were found within weeks of the onset of the illness. The abnormality in insulin secretion occurred prior to the marked weight gain. Hyperinsulinemia was not accompanied by hypoglycemia. Early hyperinsulinemia may be a primary event in the development of hyperphagia and obesity following hypothalamic injury. 
5	Treatment of Fournier's gangrene with adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Fournier's gangrene is a devastating infection and often is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Surgical debridement and antibiotics are the cornerstones of therapy. This case describes the use of hyperbaric oxygen as an adjunct in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene. 
5	Pulmonary-renal syndrome with "triad" involvement due to small vessel vasculitis. We describe the clinical course and morphologic findings of a 22-year-old woman presenting with a systemic disease that included nasal ulceration, hemoptysis and rapidly progressive renal failure. Biopsies of nasal septum and lung revealed small vessel leukocytoclastic angiitis while renal biopsy showed a diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in remission of clinical symptoms and resolution of glomerulonephritis as documented in a followup biopsy. Although her clinical presentation with triad organ involvement strongly suggested Wegener's granulomatosis, this case illustrates that other varieties of vasculitis may mimic Wegener's granulomatosis. 
5	Postischemic seizures and necrotizing ischemic brain damage: neuroprotective effect of postischemic diazepam and insulin. Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period. 
5	Snoring (I). Daytime sleepiness in regular heavy snorers. Fifteen men, mean (means) age 44 years, were investigated. Their means body mass index was 21.9 kg/m2, and all of them had a respiratory disturbance index below 5 and had good nocturnal oxygen saturation. The subjects were monitored several nights both with and without the following devices: a tight-fitting facial mask, a pneumotachometer, and an esophageal balloon. They were also monitored with and without nasal continuous positive airway pressure. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was administered after three of the experimental nights (after the baseline nights and after the second nasal CPAP night). Determination of short EEG arousals during nocturnal sleep, which lasted 2 to 10 s, was performed. The relationship between short EEG arousals, the esophageal pressure nadir, and airflow decrease was investigated. We also determined the relationship between clinical reporting of decrease in daytime alertness and MSLT results, and the relationship between MSLT results and the frequency of EEG arousals. The monitoring indicated that heavy snorers may present significant increase in Pes nadir with abrupt decrease in flow leading to EEG arousals. The frequency at which EEG arousals occur has an impact on MSLT scores. Nasal CPAP improves MSLT scores and eliminates these respiration-related EEG arousals. Some heavy snorers without obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may be at risk of having a decrease in daytime alertness. 
1	Lithiumogenic disorders of the thyroid and parathyroid glands as surgical disease. Little notice has been paid in the surgical literature to problems with psychoeffective lithium, which by interfering with adenylate cyclase affects thyroid and parathyroid function, causing hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Seven patients with lithiumogenic hyperparathyroidism occurring after years of lithium therapy underwent treatment and manifested osteoporosis (n = 2), hypertension (n = 2), nephrolithiasis (n = 1), coma (n = 1), rising hypercalcemia (n = 1), goitrous myxedema (n = 4), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (n = 2), renal failure (n = 2), and hyperlipidemia (n = 1). Disease-directed parathyroidectomy (without morbidity) was curative. Unique laboratory findings included normal serum phosphorus and reduced urinary calcium and cyclic adenosine monophosphate values. Three separate cases of thyroid carcinoma after long-term lithium therapy were also treated, being preceded by myxedema (n = 2) and concurrent with hyperparathyroidism (n = 1). There has been only one previous report of lithium-associated thyroid carcinoma. All patients taking lithium should undergo surveillance for thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction and neoplasia, and appropriate surgical and medical treatment should be considered in each situation. Although hyperparathyroidism may be reversible with lithium discontinuance, such therapy may be obligatory for patient well-being, thus dictating parathyroidectomy. 
5	Reperfusion inhibits elevated splanchnic prostanoid production after hemorrhagic shock [published erratum appears in Ann Surg 1991 Feb;213(2):91] The effect of reperfusion following hemorrhagic shock on splanchnic prostanoid release was studied. Anesthetized male rats were bled to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 mmHg for 30 minutes and either killed or treated with shed blood for 60 minutes and then killed. The superior mesenteric arterial bed was cannulated and perfused in vitro with oxygenated Krebs. Collected venous effluent (up to 180 minutes) was analyzed for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (PGI2 metabolite), PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and thromboxane B2 by radioimmunoassay in shock, shock plus reperfusion, and sham groups. The major prostanoid released was 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and was three times higher in the shock group compared to the sham group (p less than 0.05). Reperfusion of shed blood abolished the increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha found in the shock group (p less than 0.05). These data show that the attempt of the rat splanchnic bed to compensate for hemorrhagic shock by increasing release of PGI2 (potent vasodilator) was abolished during reperfusion of blood. 
1	Radical resection for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. One hundred four consecutive patients who underwent radical resection for ampullary cancer between 1965 and 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. Frequent clinical findings included jaundice (67%), significant (greater than 10%) weight loss (42%), and anemia (27%). Eighty-seven patients (84%) underwent a subtotal pancreatectomy, and 17 patients (16%) underwent a total pancreatectomy. The postoperative mortality was 5.7% (six patients), and reoperation for postoperative complications was required in six patients. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 34% and 25%, respectively. Eight patients died of tumor recurrence more than 5 years after resection. Patient survival was significantly impaired by microscopic lymphatic invasion, regional nodal metastasis, tumor grade, and the epithelium of origin. In a multivariate analysis, only microscopic lymphatic invasion significantly reduced patient survival. Radical resection for ampullary cancer can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality and should remain the procedure of choice for ampullary carcinoma. 
4	Regression of coronary artery disease as a result of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in men with high levels of apolipoprotein B BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis among men at high risk for cardiovascular events was assessed by quantitative arteriography. Of 146 men no more than 62 years of age who had apolipoprotein B levels greater than or equal to 125 mg per deciliter, documented coronary artery disease, and a family history of vascular disease, 120 completed the 2 1/2-year double-blind study, which included arteriography at base line and after treatment. Patients were given dietary counseling and were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level was elevated). RESULTS. The levels of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changed only slightly in the conventional-therapy group (mean changes, -7 and +5 percent, respectively), but more substantially among patients treated with lovastatin and colestipol (-46 and +15 percent) or niacin and colestipol (-32 and +43 percent). In the conventional-therapy group, 46 percent of the patients had definite lesion progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11 percent. By comparison, progression (as the only change) was less frequent among patients who received lovastatin and colestipol (21 percent) and those who received niacin and colestipol (25 percent), and regression was more frequent (lovastatin and colestipol, 32 percent; niacin and colestipol, 39 percent; P less than 0.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that a reduction in the level of apolipoprotein B (or LDL cholesterol) and in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in HDL cholesterol correlated independently with regression of coronary lesions. Clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening symptoms) occurred in 10 of 52 patients assigned to conventional therapy, as compared with 3 of 46 assigned to receive lovastatin and colestipol and 2 of 48 assigned to receive niacin and colestipol (relative risk of an event during intensive treatment, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.77). CONCLUSIONS. In men with coronary artery disease who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, intensive lipid-lowering therapy reduced the frequency of progression of coronary lesions, increased the frequency of regression, and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events. 
2	A case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis The group B streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Group B streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. We report here an unusual case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis. Pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally, Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. Diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. The response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. This report describes a diabetic patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen. 
5	Surgical results of intrathoracic gastric volvulus complicating hiatal hernia. From 1981 to 1988, 138 patients with hiatal hernia were treated surgically at our centre. Twenty-one (mean age 76.6 years, 17 women, four men) had an associated intrathoracic gastric volvulus. Eleven patients (mean age 73.2 years), of whom eight were asymptomatic, had an elective procedure. Ten patients (mean age 80.3 years) had emergency surgery, six for acute complications of the volvulus (five cases of strangulation and one of perforated ulcer) and four because of other, unrelated causes of acute abdomen. There were four deaths after operation, all in the emergency surgery group. Four other patients had significant morbidity, all in the emergency group. In the elective cases, all hernias were easily reduced. In one emergency case a gastrotomy was necessary for decompression, and in another gastrectomy was necessary because of gastric gangrene. Our results indicate the need for elective intervention when intrathoracic gastric volvulus is first diagnosed. 
4	Changes in haemostasis after stopping the combined contraceptive pill: implications for major surgery. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the changes in haemostasis in the three months immediately after stopping the combined contraceptive pill. DESIGN--Prospective randomised study. SETTING--Family planning centre in London. SUBJECTS--24 women aged 35-45 investigated before, during, and after six months' use of combined oral contraceptives containing 30 micrograms ethinyl oestradiol together with the progestogens desogestrel or gestodene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Blood samples were taken immediately before and after six months of oral contraceptive use and one, two, four, six, eight, and 12 weeks after the pill had been stopped. During the six months of oral contraceptive use the plasma concentration of factor X and fibrinogen increased and that of antithrombin III decreased. Between two and six weeks after stopping the pill a rebound phenomenon occurred with plasma concentrations of antithrombin III increasing (mean change from baseline at two weeks 0.06 IU/l and at six weeks 0.10 IU/l) and fibrinogen decreasing (0.26 g/l change at two weeks and 0.40 g/l at six weeks). Factor X concentrations fell gradually and the values at eight weeks were not significantly different from those found before the combined pill was started. CONCLUSION--The combined pill should be stopped at least four weeks before major surgery, which carries the risk of postoperative thrombosis, to allow the potentially prothrombotic haemostatic changes that occur during its use to be corrected. 
5	Prevalence of acute mountain sickness in the Swiss Alps. OBJECTIVE--To assess the prevalence of symptoms and signs of acute mountain sickness of the Swiss Alps. DESIGN--A study using an interview and clinical examination in a representative population of mountaineers. Positive symptoms and signs were assigned scores to quantify the severity of acute mountain sickness. SETTING--Four huts in the Swiss Alps at 2850 m, 3050 m, 3650 m, and 4559 m. SUBJECTS--466 Climbers, mostly recreational: 47 at 2850 m, 128 at 3050 m, 82 at 3650, and 209 at 4559 m. RESULTS--In all, 117 of the subjects were entirely free of symptoms and clinical signs of acute mountain sickness; 191 had one or two symptoms and signs; and 158 had more than two. Those with more than two symptoms and signs were defined as suffering from acute mountain sickness. At 4559 m 11 climbers presented with high altitude pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema, or both. Men and women were equally affected. The prevalence of acute mountain sickness correlated with altitude: it was 9% at 2850 m, 13% at 3050 m, 34% at 3650 m, and 53% at 4559 m. The most frequent symptoms and signs were insomnia, headache, peripheral oedema, and scanty pulmonary rales. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales were associated with other symptoms and signs and therefore characteristic of acute mountain sickness. CONCLUSION--Acute mountain sickness is not an uncommon disease at moderately high altitude--that is, above 2800 m. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales indicate severe acute mountain sickness, and subjects who suffer these should immediately descend to lower altitudes. 
5	Fast short-tau inversion-recovery MR imaging. To enhance the versatility of the short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences, the authors determined a range of repetition time (TR) and inversion time (TI) combinations that suppress signal intensity from fat by study of both patient and phantom images. To make fast STIR images, variations in the following pulsing conditions were studied with use of an interactive computer program: decreasing the TR, limiting the number of excitations, and limiting the number of phase-encoding steps. The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine. 
1	Relationship of tumor-cell ploidy to histologic subtype and treatment outcome in children and adolescents with unresectable rhabdomyosarcoma [published erratum appears in J Clin Oncol 1991 May;9(5):893] Clinical and histopathologic features are often inadequate for accurate prediction of relapse or survival of individual patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We therefore studied the cellular DNA content (ploidy) of RMS cells in relation to histology and response to therapy in 37 patients with unresectable tumors. Using flow cytometric techniques, we found that about one third of patients had diploid tumor stem lines, regardless of the histologic subtype. In the group with abnormal ploidy, a hyperdiploid classification (1.10 to 1.80 times the DNA content of normal diploid cells) was exclusively associated with embryonal histology (P = .001). By contrast, near-tetraploidy (1.80 to 2.60 times the DNA content of normal cells) was strongly associated with alveolar histology (P = .001). Thus, in these histologic subtypes of RMS, abnormal ploidy appears to arise through different mechanisms. Tumor-cell ploidy had a significant impact on survival that was especially apparent in patients with unresectable, nonmetastatic (group III) tumors. In this subgroup, hyperdiploidy conferred the best prognosis and diploidy the worst (P less than .0001). None of the eight patients with diploid tumors survived for more than 18 months. Tumor-cell ploidy was the best predictor of treatment outcome for patients with either embryonal (P less than .001; relative risk, 25.5) or alveolar (P = .073; relative risk 7.1) RMS and contributed significantly after adjustment for disease stage and anatomic site. Patients with unresectable diploid RMS have an unacceptably high risk of treatment failure, justifying new therapeutic approaches for this distinct subgroup. 
1	Induction of donor-type chimerism in murine recipients of bone marrow allografts by different radiation regimens currently used in treatment of leukemia patients. Three radiation protocols currently used in treatment of leukemia patients before bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were investigated in a murine model (C57BL/6----C3H/HeJ) for BM allograft rejection. These include (a) a single dose of total body irradiation (8.5 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.2 Gy/min), (b) fractionated TBI (12 Gy administered in six fractions, 2 Gy twice a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, and (c) hyperfractionated TBI (14.4 Gy administered in 12 fractions, 1.2 Gy three times a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min). Donor-type chimerism 6 to 8 weeks after BMT and hematologic reconstitution on day 12 after BMT found in these groups were compared with results obtained in mice conditioned with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.67 Gy/min, routinely used in this murine model. The results in both parameters showed a marked advantage for the single dose 8.5 Gy TBI over all the other treatments. This advantage was found to be equivalent to three- to fourfold increment in the BM inoculum when compared with hyperfractionated radiation, which afforded the least favorable conditions for development of donor-type chimerism. The fractionated radiation protocol was equivalent in its efficacy to results obtained in mice irradiated by single-dose 8 Gy TBI, both of which afforded a smaller but not significant advantage over the hyperfractionated protocol. This model was also used to test the effect of radiation dose rate on the development of donor-type chimerism. A significant enhancement was found after an increase in dose rate from 0.1 to 0.7 Gy/min. Further enhancement could be achieved when the dose rate was increased to 1.3 Gy/min, but survival at this high dose rate was reduced. These results demonstrated indirectly that dose rate affects the expression of host-type pluripotent stem cells, the progeny of which appear 3 to 6 weeks after treatment with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, but which are eradicated if radiation is delivered at a dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min. 
2	The effects of vitamin K on the generation of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (PIVKA-II) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical significance of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (PIVKA-II) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in 112 patients with and without vitamin K administration. The positivity rate of PIVKA-II was significantly decreased in patients receiving vitamin K (28.5%), compared with those without vitamin K administration (54.5%, p less than 0.05). The plasma levels of vitamin K derivatives [phylloquinone (VK1), menaquinone-4 (MK4), and menaquinone-7 (MK7)] measured were not decreased in patients with HCC, but were significantly increased in MK4 and VK1 + MK4 + MK7. The amount of PIVKA-II in plasma did not correlate with the plasma levels of vitamin K derivatives. However, PIVKA-II was decreased by the administration of vitamin K, and all of the six patients with more than 5.0 ng/ml of VK1 + MK4 + MK7 were within normal limits, whereas half of 32 patients with less than that had abnormal levels of PIVKA-II. Thus, it was suggested that PIVKA-II was not elevated due to vitamin K deficiency, but might result from the impaired metabolism or availability of vitamin K in the tumor. Therefore, PIVKA-II should be measured without vitamin K administration. 
2	Exocrine pancreatic function in chronic liver diseases. To confirm the respective influence of chronic alcoholism and liver disease on exocrine pancreatic function in cholecystokinin secretin (CS), tests were performed on patients with chronic liver cirrhosis (LC) and non-cirrhotic (nLC) disease of alcoholic (A) and nonalcoholic (nA) etiology. Results were compared in four subgroups (ALC, N = 26; AnLC, N = 45; nALC, N = 18; and nAnLC, N = 43). Volume of duodenal juice and bicarbonate output (BO) were increased and maximal bicarbonate concentration was decreased in ALC, compared with those in normal controls. Comparison of LC and nLC indicated that the volume, BO, and amylase output (AO) were greater in LC than in nLC of alcoholic etiology, but not in those of nonalcoholic etiology. The initial disappearance rate (KICG) of indocyanine green (ICG) excretion correlated with a parameter of CS test in alcoholic liver disease (vs. volume: r = -0.51, p less than 0.01 vs BO: r = -0.40, p less than 0.01), but not in nonalcoholic liver disease. Concurrent chronic pancreatitis with pain and definite exocrine insufficiency was observed in only one ALC patient and in four AnLC patients, but in none of the nonalcoholics. In alcoholic liver disease, exocrine pancreatic secretion tends to increase with severity of liver damage, but concurrence of definite chronic pancreatitis is not correlated with the severity. 
5	A denaturated venous homograft as an alternative material for shunts and other reconstructions in congenital cardiac surgery. A human venous homograft "Varivas R", in clinical use for 10 years for vascular access loops and femoropopliteal bypasses, has been used since December 1985 as a material for aortopulmonary shunts and other reconstructive procedures in congenital heart surgery. For this purpose vein segments 5 cm length, varying in diameter from 4 up to 10 mm by steps of 1 mm, were obtained. Our experience with Varivas is limited to 59 patients. Of 47 infants, 18 received a left, and 25 a right sided aortopulmonary shunt, 9 had bilateral aortopulmonary shunts, 2 right ventricle pulmonary conduits, 1 a pulmonary-pulmonary conduit, 3 interrupted aortic arch reconstructions and 4 a central aortopulmonary shunt, 1 with confluence reconstruction, 3 recidives of coarctation a patch repair. Among 11 adults 6 received coronary bypass and 6 others vascular reconstructions. In contrast to other artificial graft materials, the vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein grafts in coronary surgery. The appropriate diameter sizes match better the infants anatomy, without the risk of kinking and/or anastomosis displacement. Peroperatively it was possible to confirm patency by electromagnetic flow measurement and the postoperative examinations were done by colour Doppler echocardiography. We had to reoperate upon 4 infants because of early thrombosis; on 1 infant for stenosis of the graft and on another 5 for late thrombosis. In an attempt to extend the indications for "inoperable" pulmonary hypoplasia/atresia we were not able to keep the shunt open in 4 infants. 
4	Atrial fibrillation and left atrial enlargement: cause or effect? In a blinded controlled study, 58 consecutive patients with definite left atrial enlargement (M-mode dimension of at least 45 mm) were followed up after 1-2 years. The aim of the study was to examine the following: (a) the prospective risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF); and (b) the effect of the heart rhythm on the left atrial size. Of 36 patients in sinus rhythm, one developed paroxysmal AF and one developed persistent AF during a median follow-up period of 20 months. Thus the incidence of new AF was 5% per year. Eighteen patients died before scheduled echocardiographic follow-up, but in the remaining subjects the left atrial dimension did not change significantly: the median increment was 1 mm in 20 patients who sustained sinus rhythm vs 2 mm in 16 patients with chronic AF (P greater than 0.05). Although left atrial dilatation may cause AF and vice versa, this study demonstrated that the incidence of new AF is low, despite the fact that the left atrial dimension is substantially increased. Similarly, AF per se does not appear to have any major impact on the left atrial dimension. 
4	Medical management of acute traumatic rupture of the aorta. Surgical reconstruction is the treatment for acute traumatic aortic rupture and should be accomplished immediately in most patients. In patients in whom concomitant injuries or the development of life-threatening complications preclude safe and successful aortic reconstruction, pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of free aortic rupture may be considered. Surgical reconstruction can then be more safely performed under controlled elective circumstances. 
3	The deja vu experience: remembrance of things past? The deja vu experience is a common phenomenon, occurring in pathological as well as nonpathological conditions. It has been defined as any subjectively inappropriate impression of familiarity of a present experience with an undefined past. The authors discuss the epidemiologic data, clinical features, and etiology of the phenomenon of deja vu. They also review the different hypotheses on the psychopathogenesis of the deja vu experience and introduce an explanation based on the hologram as a mnestic model. 
3	Effects of head trauma from motor vehicle accidents on Parkinson's disease. During 1 year we monitored changes in clinical disability scores in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who sustained head trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Disability significantly increased immediately after trauma, but returned to baseline levels in subsequent weeks. These patients' signs deteriorated over the subsequent year, but this decline was equivalent to that of a matched control group with PD who did not have a motor vehicle accident or trauma. Based on these data, we conclude that trauma or stress caused by motor vehicle accidents can transiently exacerbate parkinsonian dysfunction without causing persistent increased disability or an alteration in disease course. 
1	Renal cell carcinoma associated with sarcoidlike tissue reaction. A 60-year-old man was referred to our institution with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Because of several months' complaint of right flank pain and weight loss, the patient had consulted his local physician. After an extensive workup revealed only cholelithiasis, he underwent a cholecystectomy for presumed chronic cholecystitis. At the time of operation, biopsy of several liver nodules and peripancreatic nodes revealed noncaseating granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. On initial examination at our institution, the patient had microhematuria. A chest roentgenogram demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules, an abdominal computed tomographic scan showed an indeterminate left renal mass, and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed abnormal signals in the body of T-12. Open-lung biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma with clear cell features, likely of renal origin. The patient was diagnosed as having a metastatic renal carcinoma associated with a sarcoidlike tissue reaction. Although noncaseating granulomas have been reported in association with other malignant lesions, to our knowledge this is the first report of such an association with renal carcinoma. In addition, this case illustrates several points. First, sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder with protean extrapulmonary manifestations. In fact, all our patient's findings could have been attributed to sarcoidosis. Second, noncaseating granulomas occur with many types of processes, including infections, chemical exposures, and, as in this case, neoplasms. Thus, noncaseating granulomas are not pathognomonic for sarcoidosis. Third, sarcoidosis is a clinical diagnosis that cannot be based on histologic findings alone. 
5	Allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness and inflammation in mild asthma. The relationship between airway responsiveness to methacholine and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was determined in patients with history of rhinitis and/or mild bronchial asthma either at baseline (10 patients) or 3-4 h after allergen inhalation challenge (11 patients). At baseline, airway responsiveness did not correlate with any BAL cell population. When data obtained after allergen challenge were included in the analysis, 44% of the variability of airway responsiveness was explained by a multiple regression model with BAL eosinophils as a directly correlated (P = 0.002) independent variable and with BAL macrophages as an inversely correlated (P = 0.045) independent variable. Changes in airway responsiveness after allergen challenge were predicted (82% of variance explained) by a model with BAL eosinophils and BAL lymphocytes as directly correlated (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.03, respectively) independent variables. We conclude that, in stable asymptomatic asthma, baseline airway responsiveness does not correlate with the presence in the airways of inflammatory and immunoeffector cells that can be recovered by BAL. Nevertheless the allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness is associated with an influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the bronchial lumen. 
5	Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. 
3	32-gauge spinal catheters through 26-gauge needles Small diameter intrathecal catheters potentially combine the certainty of intrathecal injection and the advantage of repeatability, without the risk of a high incidence of headache after dural puncture. We report problems placing such catheters. 
4	Lovastatin. Warfarin interaction. Two patients who developed hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding due to lovastatin-warfarin drug interaction are described. Because of the wider use of lovastatin and warfarin, heightened clinical awareness of this potentially serious interaction must be publicized. Therefore, prothrombin time should be monitored diligently when warfarin is prescribed to patients receiving lovastatin. 
5	Lack of association between keratoconus, mitral valve prolapse, and joint hypermobility. The authors enrolled 95 patients with keratoconus and 96 matched controls in a cross-sectional study to determine if mitral valve prolapse and hypermobile joints occur with greater frequency in individuals with keratoconus than in individuals without keratoconus. The hypothesis that keratoconus may not be a distinct eye disease, but a nonspecific sign representing a more generalized systemic disorder, possibly a mild collagen tissue abnormality, was considered. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography and cardiac auscultation detected no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in patients with keratoconus compared with controls. Formal, systematic examination of five joints also failed to detect a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of hypermobile joints in keratoconus patients and controls. However, as an ancillary finding, a significantly higher proportion of patients with keratoconus was found to have a history of hay fever than was the case with controls. 
5	Role of new antiplatelet agents as adjunctive therapies in thrombolysis. Coronary thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarcts who have no contraindications to such therapy. However, the time required for thrombolysis and the possibility of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. Herein are described experimental animal studies and clinical evaluations in which attempts have been made to develop adjunctive therapies that, when coupled with available thrombolytic interventions, might shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent reocclusion. From the studies conducted to date, it is clear that a combined thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist and heparin shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models with copper coil-induced coronary artery thrombi. A monoclonal antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor coupled with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and heparin also shortens the time to thrombolysis and delays or prevents reocclusion in experimental canine models. Thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and synthetic inhibitors, given with t-PA and aspirin, appear to shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models. Aspirin coupled with intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality in patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction, and a combination of heparin and t-PA results in infarct-artery patency more frequently than t-PA without heparin. Data from these studies are encouraging with regard to the possibility of developing effective and relatively safe thrombolytic regimens that shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion. 
2	Acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients with diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study focused on 401 children less than 5 years old who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and who were investigated for the presence of both bacterial and viral respiratory tract pathogens as well as for selected diarrheal pathogens. The most common manifestations of ALRI were pneumonia (374 cases), bronchiolitis (12 cases), and tracheobronchitis (11 cases). The majority (77%) of the illnesses were in children less than 2 years of age, and 88% of the children were malnourished. A respiratory tract pathogen was identified in 30% of the patients, and a diarrheal pathogen was identified in 34%. The overall case-fatality rate in children with ALRI and diarrhea was 8%. The case-fatality rate was 14% in children with bacterial pneumonia and diarrhea, 3% in those with viral pneumonia and diarrhea, and 14% in malnourished children with shigellosis and ALRI. The most common respiratory tract pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
1	Delayed reconstruction following Mohs' chemosurgery for skin cancers of the head and neck. The case records of 52 patients with 55 cutaneous neoplasms treated by Mohs' chemosurgery and subsequently reconstructed by plastic surgeons were reviewed to determine if delay between resection and reconstruction adversely affected the outcome of reconstruction. Reconstruction was performed from 5 to 61 days after Mohs' chemosurgery for 45 basal cell carcinomas and 10 other cutaneous neoplasms. There were no complications during the interval between resection and reconstruction. Following reconstruction, minor wound complications occurred in 6% of patients; there were no major complications. Microscopic examination of the re-excised wound revealed residual disease in 2 of 45 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 0 of 10 other cutaneous malignancies. Both patients with residual basal cell carcinomas (i.e., false-negative margins after Mohs' surgery) had presented to the Mohs' surgeon with recurrent tumors. During a follow-up period of 3 months to 3 years after complete resection, recurrent tumor developed in 2 of 45 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 3 of 8 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Delayed reconstruction, usually 5 to 20 days after Mohs' chemosurgery, can be performed without significant morbidity. Re-excision of the Mohs' chemosurgical wound for pathologic examination can detect residual disease and may be especially indicated for large recurrent wounds. 
4	Effect of tachycardia on regional function and transmural myocardial perfusion during graded coronary pressure reduction in conscious dogs The purpose of the present study was to examine subendocardial flow and function during graded coronary pressure reduction to determine the effect of tachycardia on the lower autoregulatory pressure limit (critical coronary pressure) in unanesthetized dogs. During atrial pacing at a rate of 200 beats/min, subendocardial flow measured by radioactive microspheres averaged 1.55 +/- 0.34 ml/min/g and remained unchanged as pressure was reduced over the autoregulatory plateau from 84 +/- 10 to 59 +/- 7 mm Hg. Further reductions in coronary pressure to below a critical coronary pressure of approximately 60 mm Hg were associated with concomitant reductions in subendocardial flow and the endocardial-epicardial flow ratio during tachycardia. Although regional function remained constant over the autoregulatory plateau, there was a rightward shift of the coronary pressure-function relation during ischemia in response to a steady-state increase in rate from 100 to 200 beats/min. Reductions in regional wall thickening began when coronary pressures reached 38 +/- 7 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 beats/min and 61 +/- 6 mm Hg at a heart rate of 200 beats/min (p less than 0.005). Similar critical coronary pressure values were obtained for subendocardial segment shortening. Relations between subendocardial flow and myocardial function measured by both transmural wall thickening and subendocardial segment shortening were linear during pacing at a heart rate of 200 beats/min with relative reductions in wall thickening related to reductions in subendocardial flow on a nearly one-to-one basis. The results of this study demonstrate that there is a shift in the lower limit of subendocardial autoregulation during tachycardia as manifest by the onset of subendocardial ischemia at a higher distal coronary artery pressure. The shift in critical coronary pressure relates to an increase in resting flow requirements due to increased demand and diminished subendocardial vasodilator reserve at any given coronary pressure secondary to a reduction in the time available for diastolic subendocardial perfusion during tachycardia. 
5	Reference ranges for lymphocyte subsets. A comparison of standard vs rapid whole-blood lysis techniques. Reference ranges for lymphocyte subsets may vary with processing techniques, monoclonal reagents, or analytic methods. We compared reference ranges obtained for T- and B-lymphocyte subsets by means of standard manual whole-blood lysis with a wash step vs a rapid, no-wash whole-blood lysis system. Both techniques demonstrated reference ranges similar to those in previous literature reports. The ranges established with standard and rapid lysis were similar when antibodies directed to the same cluster designation were used. Although slight statistical differences in relative percentages of CD2 and CD3 lymphocytes were observed, these differences were probably not clinically significant. These data indicate that the rapid technique provides a standardized method for enumerating T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood. 
5	Development of a special care unit for chronically critically ill patients. Intensive care units (ICUs) are recognized as one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals. Within these ICUs are a growing population of patients whose stays are extensively prolonged because of complications or underlying chronic health conditions that are exacerbated by a critical illness. These patients can be described as "chronically critically ill" and are costly to hospitals both in terms of actual dollars and in terms of the burden of care to nurses and physicians. This article describes the creation of a special care unit (SCU) designed specifically to meet the needs of chronically critically ill patients. The SCU environment is composed of a physical design that accommodates limited technology and care aimed at family involvement and rehabilitation, a case management practice model, and a shared governance management model. This structure is in contrast to traditional ICU environments, which include physical layouts that allow for high technology and close monitoring of patients, a primary nursing delivery system, and a bureaucratic management model. A research project to compare the effects of the SCU with the effects of the traditional ICUs on nurse and patient outcomes is described. 
4	Percutaneous extraction of fractured guidewire from distal right coronary artery. The incidence of retained hardware components in the coronary artery tree is likely to parallel the growing number and types of percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures being performed. Management has extended from the conservative option of simply leaving behind the retained components to the more aggressive approach of surgical removal. A percutaneous method is described herein which offers the interventional cardiologist an alternative method of managing patients with retained wire fragments contained entirely in the coronary artery. 
4	Late cardiac effects of doxorubicin therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood BACKGROUND. Cardiotoxicity is a recognized complication of doxorubicin therapy, but the long-term effects of doxorubicin are not well documented. We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission. METHODS. Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography. RESULTS. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P less than 0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event. CONCLUSIONS. Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years. 
4	A multicenter study of doxazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension in France. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerance of doxazosin in patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential hypertension in a general practice setting. Ninety-six adults of a mean age of 55 1/2 years took part in the 14-week study, consisting of a placebo phase (2 weeks), a dose-adjustment phase with doxazosin (8 weeks), and a maintenance phase (4 weeks). Doxazosin, at a final mean daily dose of 3.4 mg, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in blood pressure at all points of measurement during the study. The mean change in sitting blood pressure at the end of treatment was -15.4/-15.8 mm Hg. Of the 85 patients who could be categorized as a success or failure, 78 (92%) were considered a therapeutic success; 78 (89%) of the 88 efficacy-evaluable patients demonstrated an improvement in the severity category of their hypertension. Treatment with doxazosin produced a reduction in serum cholesterol (-3.1%) and triglyceride (-3.8%) levels, although these changes did not attain statistical significance. The calculated probability of developing coronary heart disease in 10 years (according to the Framingham equation) was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced by 22%, from 16.7 chances per 100 (baseline) to 14.3 chances per 100 (final visit). Twenty-six patients (27.1%) reported side effects that were possibly related to treatment, the most prevalent of which were vertigo (7.3%) and headache (6.3%). In four (4.2%) patients the dose of doxazosin was reduced and two (2.1%) were withdrawn prematurely. The investigator's assessments of tolerance was reduced and two (2.1%) were considered to be excellent or good in 85 (88%) patients. 
1	Rehabilitation of physically disabled dentists: a model for a vocationally specific rehabilitation program. A unique collaborative program whose goal is to facilitate the return of disabled dentists to active dental practice is described. This approach includes comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation and remediation, and it has succeeded in revealing previously undiagnosed impairments which should be considered in the formulation of a rehabilitation plan. A case report illustrates the process. This program can serve as a model for similar programs addressing the needs of other disabled health care professionals. 
2	Intussusception and the diagnostic value of testing stool for occult blood. A retrospective review was performed to determine the diagnostic value of testing for occult blood in stool of children suspect for intussusception. Ninety-six children had barium enema studies for suspected intussusception. Of the 57 children who had barium enema confirmed intussusception, 29 did not have history or physical findings of gross blood per rectum. Stool was tested for occult blood in 16 of these 29 patients, and 12 (75%) were positive. In comparison, three (20%) of the children who did not have intussusception had stool positive for occult blood. Stool with occult blood was significantly associated with intussusception (P less than .002). The only other clinical factor significantly associated with intussusception was abdominal mass (P less than .02). Vomiting, episodic irritability, poor feeding, abdominal pain and lethargy were not significantly different in the two groups. In conclusion, the authors suggest stool testing for occult blood when evaluating children who present with nonspecific signs and symptoms supportive of intussusception. 
4	Pulmonary resection combined with cardiac operations. Surgical management of patients with concomitant critical cardiac disease and resectable lung lesions is controversial. During a 7-year period (1982 to 1988), 21 patients underwent combined cardiac and pulmonary operations. Patients had cardiac symptoms only; the lung lesions were found on preoperative chest roentgenograms. The pathological diagnosis was established in only 2 of the patients before operation. All underwent concurrent pulmonary resection during cardiac operations requiring extracorporeal circulation. The pulmonary operations included 17 wedge resections and four lobectomies. The final diagnoses in 8 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer included epidermoid carcinoma (4), adenocarcinoma (3), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (1). Postoperatively, 1 patient required a permanent pacemaker and 1 patient died. The actuarial survival at 5 years for all patients who underwent combined procedures was 95%. The 5-year survival for the 8 patients with lung cancer was 88% compared with 100% for those with benign pulmonary pathology (p = 0.172). This experience suggests that combining pulmonary resection with cardiac operations is safe and offers a favorable prognosis to a select group of patients. 
1	Regional chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases: a phase II evaluation of targeted hepatic arterial 5-fluorouracil for colorectal liver metastases. The results of systemic chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer remain dismal. Regional chemotherapy has been advocated as a method of improving the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumour, while minimizing systemic toxicity. The use of vasoactive agents to redistribute arterial blood flow towards tumour, and of biodegradable microspheres to slow tumour blood flow, have also been suggested as methods of further improving tumour exposure to drug. We present 21 patients who received intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases. Combined treatment (angiotensin II, albumin microspheres and 5-fluorouracil) was administered 4-6 weekly, and bolus 5-fluorouracil was given in the intervening weeks. Toxicity was minimal. Responses were seen in seven patients. Fewer than half of the deaths were from liver metastases; a quarter of the patients died from non-cancer-related causes. Survival was prolonged in the treated group compared with historical controls. These results suggest that this regimen has activity in patients with colorectal liver metastases. 
1	Expression of blood group antigens by normal bronchopulmonary tissues and common forms of pulmonary carcinomas. The expression of ABH and Lewis antigens has been studied in a series of pulmonary carcinomas, in areas of squamous metaplasia, and in normal adjacent bronchopulmonary tissues by means of a panel of lectins and monoclonal antibodies. All respiratory epithelial cells can express antigens, with the exception of glandular serous cells. The expression of AB antigens is rather homogeneous, while Lewis antigens are expressed in a more irregular pattern, alternating positively stained cells with negatively stained cells in the same microscopic field. The expression of blood group antigens allows the identification of residual pneumocytes inside the tumor and the proper classification of some neoplasms. Metaplastic areas show a variation in the staining profile when compared with normal tissues and pulmonary carcinomas. The most significant findings are the deletion of A antigen and the strong expression of Le antigen. Pulmonary carcinomas are composed by a heterogeneous population and tend to express antigens in the more differentiated cases or areas. The most important findings are the deletion of AB antigens and the strong expression of Le(y) antigen. 
1	Preoperative endoscopic diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp of the renal pelvis: a case report and review of the literature. Benign fibroepithelial polyps of the renal pelvis are rare, with only 9 cases described previously in the literature. We report an additional case and suggest how nephrectomy may be avoided. 
1	Molecular surgery of the basement membrane by the argon laser. Although the argon laser is used successfully to weld a number of different tissues, the underlying chemical and cellular mechanisms for this process are not precisely defined. Consequently, a biochemical model has been developed in vitro using the well-defined extracellular matrix from the murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma. Control and experimental samples of EHS basement membranes were irradiated with a Trimedyne argon laser at 500-3,000 Joules/cm2 at 0 degrees C. The samples were diluted into cold phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to gel at 35 degrees C. The time course of the gelation reaction was followed in a spectrophotometer at 360 nm. Irradiation reduced the absorbance 7.5-15% compared to controls and was independent of the dilution over a 10-fold range. Gelation was also measured by determining the amount of protein by the Bradford assay that could be collected by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 minutes. Argon-irradiated samples had 30-40% less protein in the precipitate than the controls. The addition of 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol to the EHS extract blocked the effect of the laser on the gelation reaction. In addition, when gelation was carried out in the absence of calcium and magnesium, there were no differences between laser-treated samples and controls. The basement membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels under denaturing plus reducing or denaturing and non-reducing conditions. No differences in the polypeptide composition were noted between irradiated and control samples using either Coomassie- or silver-staining techniques. 
1	Exposure histories in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia patients with a prior preleukemic condition. A subset of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) have evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), low infiltrate leukemia, or other preleukemic condition that may be present for several months before onset of disease. The hypothesis that these conditions act as markers for environmentally induced cancer was examined in 270 ANLL patients, 46 with a preleukemic phase and 224 with an acute onset. Although the effects of previously identified risk factors (male sex, age older than 50 years, prior cytotoxic therapy) were demonstrated, no associations with common environmental conditions (cigarette smoking, alcohol use, occupations with exposure to chemicals or radiation) were present with the exception of hobbies involving potential chemical exposure, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals = 4.2 (1.4 to 12.3) and self-reported exposure to pesticides, OR = 10.2 (1.8 to 63.1). These may be chance associations although a previous case-control study of MDS reported similar findings. 
1	The impact of microinvasion on axillary node metastases and survival in patients with intraductal breast cancer. A rational approach to the local treatment of intraductal breast cancer continues to generate considerable debate. However, the finding of an invasive component in intraductal breast cancer is widely regarded as an appropriate indication for axillary node dissection as part of the local treatment and staging of this disease. Despite this view, the natural history of patients with intraductal breast cancer with foci of microinvasion is poorly defined. Between 1965 and 1988, 41 patients with this pathologic finding of intraductal carcinoma with foci of microinvasion were seen at the UCLA Medical Center. Twenty-three patients presented with mammographic abnormalities, while 17 patients presented with a palpable mass. One patient presented with Paget's disease of the nipple. Thirty-three patients underwent axillary node dissection as part of their local treatment. No lymph node metastases were identified. The median follow-up in 37 patients was 47 months. There have been no local recurrences and no deaths from recurrent breast cancer. Intraductal breast cancer associated with microinvasion appears to be an extremely favorable lesion with minimal risk of nodal metastases. 
5	Interaction of two different disorders in the beta-globin gene cluster associated with an increased hemoglobin F production: a novel deletion type of G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia and a delta zero-hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin determinant. We report two different disorders of the beta-globin gene cluster segregating in a Belgian family: a novel deletion that results in G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia (thal) and a heterocellular hereditary persistence of foetal hemoglobin of the Swiss type linked to a delta degree-thal gene (delta degree-HPFH). Heterozygosity for the heterocellular HPFH brings about a moderate (3.4% to 8.24%) increase of hemoglobin (Hb) F having a G gamma/A gamma ratio of 4:1, whereas carriers of the G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal deletion show in their peripheral blood a considerably higher (15%) percentage of Hb F. Both defects interact in the compound heterozygotes for G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal and delta zero-HPFH producing a further increase (up to 24%) of fetal Hb consisting entirely of G gamma chains. Molecular characterization of the G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal by means of Southern analysis showed that the deletion spans about 50 kb, removing the 3' end of the A gamma-gene, the psi beta-, delta-, and beta-genes. A number of possible mechanisms leading to the overproduction of Hb F in HPFH and G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal will be discussed. 
1	The diagnosis and definition of hepatic malignancies by use of arterial enhanced computerized tomographic scanning. Axial computerized tomography is a useful tool in the evaluation of either primary or metastatic hepatic neoplasms. An adjunct to this technique is visceral arterial enhanced computerized tomography (AECT). To determine the effectiveness of this modality, bolus intravenous enhanced computerized tomography scans and AECT were compared and correlated to operative findings. Fifty-four consecutive patients were evaluated by AECT and bolus intravenous enhanced computerized tomography over a 30-month period (May 1986 to August 1989) for suspected primary or metastatic hepatic malignancies. Forty-four patients (81%) had hepatic lesions. Fifty-two percent (23 of 44 patients) of the metastatic tumors were from colonic or rectal primary lesions, and 20% were hepatocellular primary lesions. The remainder of the lesions were metastases from a variety of primary lesions. When studies were compared, 34% of the patients (15 of 44 patients) differed in either the location or total number of lesions noted. The lesions of three of the 15 patients (20%) were determined unresectable on the basis of AECT. Of the remaining patients, planned resections were revised in seven patients to either lesser or greater procedures. The number of lesions found at laparotomy equaled the number found by AECT in all but two cases. AECT caused no complications. AECT improved our ability to identify and localize primary and metastatic lesions of the liver. This technique offers the advantage of preoperative definition of the hepatic arterial and portal venous anatomy. 
4	Evolution of human cardiac myocyte dimension during prolonged mechanical support. In animal models using left ventricular assist systems over long time periods, myocardial cellular atrophy has been reported, raising concern that prolonged clinical use of such systems might lead to deterioration in left ventricular function. At the University of Pittsburgh, long-term clinical use of the Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Novacor Div., Oakland, Calif.) left ventricular support system for patients awaiting heart transplants has allowed study of the effects of long-term mechanical support on human subjects. This study determined that cardiac myocyte dimension is initially greater in patients with end-stage cardiac disease who require support rather than in patients with the same disease who do not require such support. Although myocyte dimension does decrease within a few days of the inception of support, this decrease merely brings cell size closer to the values usual in patients with chronic end-stage cardiac disease, and no further shrinkage is observed. Thus the Novacor left ventricular assist system does not appear associated with left ventricular atrophy, and its long-term use may not be detrimental to left ventricular function. 
4	Time of onset of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in relation to alcohol consumption. It is widely believed but has never been proved that idiopathic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias beginning during or after weekends or winter holidays are frequently alcohol-related ("holiday heart" syndrome). The time of arrhythmia onset was therefore studied in relation to self-reported ethanol consumption and results of a screening test for alcoholism (CAGE questionnaire) in 289 patients aged less than 65 years admitted for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. There were 102 patients having an etiologically idiopathic arrhythmia with a known time of onset. Among them, but not among those with disease-related arrhythmias, patients with arrhythmic episodes beginning on Saturdays or on Sundays were more often chronic alcohol abusers (9 of 19, 47%) than either patients with episodes beginning from Mondays through Fridays (18 of 83, 22%; p = 0.040) or control subjects from the out-of-hospital population (8 of 66, 12%; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, the time of arrhythmia onset was related to the CAGE response (G2 = 6.0, p = 0.014) but not to the most recent ethanol use. However, the increased frequency of problem drinkers among patients with weekend-onset idiopathic arrhythmias was only relative, and resulted from a decreased number of abstainers and non-problem drinkers. No conspicuous clustering of alcohol-related arrhythmias was seen after New Year's or May Day. Thus, although the present study confirms an association between heavy drinking and idiopathic arrhythmias beginning during weekends, it shows that the question may be of a relative rather than an absolute overrepresentation. The term holiday heart may also be somewhat misleading since no postholiday accumulation of alcohol-related arrhythmias was found. 
3	A novel treatment for ischemic intracranial hypertension in cats. There is no accepted efficacious treatment for ischemic cerebral edema. We show in a cat model of focal cerebral ischemia that infarct volume can be reduced (p less than 0.05) by ventriculocisternal perfusion with an oxygenated fluorochemical emulsion (bis-perfluorobutylethylene). An accompanying effect of such ventriculocisternal perfusion is a reduction in intracranial pressure. At 18 hours following the start of the perfusion, there was a significant (p less than 0.05) difference in intracranial pressure between nonperfused controls (mean 11.4 [range 2.3-23.0] torr, n = 6) and cats perfused with an oxygenated nutrient solution not containing fluorochemical (mean 11.3 [range 3.0-29.0] torr, n = 8) or animals perfused with the oxygenated fluorochemical emulsion (mean 2.21 [range 0-3.5] torr, n = 7). Perfusion with this oxygenated fluorochemical emulsion warrants further study as a treatment for elevated intracranial pressure. 
3	Initial CT findings in 753 patients with severe head injury. A report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank. In this prospective multicenter study, the authors have examined data derived from the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans of 753 patients with severe head injury. When the CT findings were related to abnormal intracranial pressure and to death, the most important characteristics of the scans were: midline shift: compression or obliteration of the mesencephalic cisterns: and the presence of subarachnoid blood. Diffuse hemispheric swelling was also found to be associated with an early episode of either hypoxia or hypotension. 
5	Development of multiple necrotizing enteritis induced by a tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages in rats. We report the development of an animal model of multiple necrotizing enteritis (MNE) in rats. When rats were injected directly with a culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages into the abdominal aorta, the overt pathologic lesions of MNE developed within 30 minutes after injection. The rats showed an elevated level of blood fibrinogen degradation product content even 30 minutes after injection. Furthermore the rats that were pretreated intravenously with heparin sulfate did not develop MNE, indicating the acute disturbances of blood microcirculation in the intestine. Multiple necrotizing enteritis was developed also by the injection with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) but rarely was observed with even a high dose of recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1) or platelet-activating factor (PAF). The supernatant was cytotoxic in vitro to TNF-susceptible LM and many other cells but was less cytotoxic to the TNF-resistant LR line. Partial purification of the supernatant suggested that the supernatant contained a cytokine that has biochemical features of TNF. Furthermore polyclonal anti-TNF antibody could inhibit not only the cytotoxicity in vitro but also MNE development in vivo by this factor. These data strongly indicate that MNE possibly could be caused by a TNF-like cytokine produced by macrophages that are stimulated by the endotoxin. 
4	Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium. In recent years there has been considerable interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products. Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism. Several possible sources have been identified for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary. 
3	Brain stem tuberculoma in adult patients: diagnosis and treatment. A consecutive series of six adult patients ranging in age from 29 to 53 years is presented. The clinical and radiological features in each patient are described. Attention is drawn to the features demonstrated on computed axial tomography. In only one patient, the first encountered, was surgical excision undertaken and histological verification obtained. One patient died before any form of treatment could be instituted. The remaining four patients were treated with antituberculous chemotherapy alone and their progress monitored by sequential computed tomography. The excellent response and good outcome in this conservatively treated group are documented. 
5	Research and policy directions. Salt and blood pressure. The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial. The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption. If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure. The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels. A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure. 
1	Local reactions to radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer. PURPOSE: To compare the rate of local complications resulting from radioiodine ablation of thyroid cancer in patients with a residual intact thyroid lobe to that in patients who had more extensive surgical treatment prior to radioiodine administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 59 patients who had received 131I between 1979 and 1989. The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the extent of their previous surgical thyroid excision. Group 1 comprised 10 patients with a lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy before the ablative radioiodine dose, and Group 2 comprised 49 patients with more extensive thyroid excision (near-total or subtotal thyroidectomy) before the radioiodine treatment. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the 10 patients in Group 1 experienced some degree of neck pain or tenderness following radioiodine ablation of their residual thyroid. In one case, the local reaction was very severe and accompanied by the development of transient hyperthyroidism. There was only a 6% local complication rate in the patients who had undergone more extensive thyroid excision before ablative therapy (p less than 0.001), and none had a severe reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with only unilateral surgical excision before radioiodine therapy have a higher rate of local complications than do patients treated with more extensive surgery prior to radioiodine ablation. If radioiodine is to be employed in such patients, they should be informed of this possible complication. Since evidence supports a dose effect in the pathogenesis of the complications, we recommend using a dose of less than 30 mCi for the initial ablation in these patients even though it may be necessary to repeat this dose to complete thyroid ablation. 
5	Herniation of the antral membrane through an extraction site. Report of a case. A case of herniation of the antral membrane through a recent extraction site is presented. The lesion was initially diagnosed as a tumor by the referring dentist. Oroantral fistulas are not an uncommon finding after dental extractions. It is rare, however, to see herniation of the antral membrane with large polyps extending through the fistula into the oral cavity. A search of the literature revealed only two other such cases. Surgical removal of the polyps and closure of the oroantral fistula by means of a buccal sliding flap technique is discussed. 
5	Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials as a prognostic indicator for motor recovery in stroke patients. Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke. Normal values for MEP and motor central conduction time (CCT) were obtained in 46 healthy controls whose MEPs were evaluated during slight voluntary muscle contraction and at rest. Two months later 23 patients were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Motor function change was correlated with MEP results. Two months after stroke the patients with normal or prolonged CCT had an improved motor function compared with those with absent CCT. MEP may be a valuable prognostic indicator in the acute stage of paralytic stroke for recovery of motor function. 
5	Hyaluronan in pleural effusions and in serum. It has been suggested that a high level of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HYA) in pleural fluid is an indicator of malignant mesothelioma. In 78 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of various causes the HYA concentration was measured in pleural fluid samples and in serum. Nine patients had malignant pleural mesothelioma, and in three of them the HYA level in pleural fluid was 100 mg/l or more. In 42 patients with effusions due to metastatic malignancy, the mean HYA in the pleural fluid was 75 mg/l, and in five the HYA level was above 100 mg/l. Cardiac insufficiency caused the effusion in 11 patients, of whom two had a level above 100 mg/l in pleural fluid. Four patients had a serologically confirmed viral infection and had HYA levels in pleural fluid of 8, 157, 335, and 554 mg/l, respectively. One patient had postinfectious effusion with an HYA level in pleural exudate of 748 mg/l, the highest in this investigation. Two patients had benign asbestos pleural effusions, and both had high pleural HYA levels (256 and 490 mg/l, respectively). The serum HYA values were much lower than in the pleural fluid, namely from 15 to 480 micrograms/l; the levels were independent of the levels in the pleural fluid. Thus, a high level of HYA in pleural fluid is not specific for mesothelioma but can occur in other malignant or benign diseases, and a low level does not exclude mesothelioma. 
1	The child with recurrent solid tumor. A significant percentage of relapse occurs in children with solid tumors despite advances in treatment. This article discusses reasons for failure of primary therapy, evaluation of the relapsed patient, treatment of the relapsed patient, as well as questionable cancer therapies and therapy cessation. 
1	Literacy and laryngectomy: how should one treat head and neck cancer in patients who cannot read or write? The entire population of otolaryngologists and radiation oncologists (N = 192) in active practice in the state of North Carolina were surveyed to assess their level of awareness of illiteracy among adults in the United States and to determine whether these physicians consider illiteracy in the treatment decision process for patients with head and neck cancer. Excluding respondents who did not treat patients with head and neck cancer and physicians practicing outside of the state of North Carolina, the response rate was 115 of 182, or 63%. Only 26% of respondents were able to estimate correctly the prevalence of illiteracy in the US adult population. Forty-one percent of respondents, however, stated that they did consider their patient's ability to read and/or write before making treatment recommendations for head and neck cancer. This survey and accompanying literature review suggest that physicians perceive illiteracy as a problem that may have a significant impact on patients with head and neck cancer, but lack the data needed to enable them to quantify the effect of illiteracy on treatment outcome. The study reported is the first step in examining ways in which illiteracy might negatively affect patient outcomes. 
1	Skeletal manifestations of ectopic or inappropriate endocrine and metabolic syndromes. A variety of tumors and nontumorous lesions were used to illustrate some of the biologic, clinical, and pathologic aspects of inappropriate or ectopic endocrine and metabolic syndromes that have musculoskeletal repercussions. It is clear, both from the discussion and case material, that many mechanisms of ectopic endocrine syndromes have yet to be clarified. Elaborate techniques are available for hormonal estimations, but their routine use is prohibitively expensive and relatively unrewarding. Cells of a given lesion may be functionally heterogeneous or may fail to elaborate active products in substantial amounts. Different cells may produce similar peptides, while the same cells can produce more than one. Despite these difficulties, recognition of ectopic endocrine syndromes remains crucial to diagnosis and patient management, and thus corroboration or correlation must often rest on a cruder basis. In fact, the clinical significance of basic laboratory data, e.g., PTH elevation, may vary, as PTH may be immunoreactive but biologically inactive. As another example, hypercalcemia associated with myeloma may be variously related to coexistent hyperparathyroidism, renal disease, dehydration, or humoral osteolysis. Therefore, roentgenographic evidence of bone destruction or skeletal stigmata of hyperparathyroidism imbues laboratory data with greater significance. Paraneoplastic syndromes are of particular concern to the radiologist, as multiple systemic manifestations, occurring either synchronously or metachronously, may suggest the presence of an underlying or unifying lesion or even of a specific type of neoplasm. They may precede detection of neoplasms by months to years and can develop at any time during their course. Paraneoplastic syndromes may, furthermore, parallel the course of a lesion and be used as indicators of remission or recurrence. Conversely, those unassociated with overt symptoms possess endocrine markers that can reinforce sometimes silent skeletal stigmata. Familiarity with representative secretory products influencing the musculoskeletal system per se may often clarify seemingly innocuous and sometimes asymptomatic skeletal findings. Alert imagers may, therefore, detect, infer, or suspect particular syndromes when they present in a specific sequence or mosaic. Conversely, when apprised of their existence, imagers should know where their related effects may be sought or anticipated. Such relationships, sometimes serendipitously discovered, may be valuable assets in clinical diagnosis and patient management in both suspected and unsuspected cases. 
4	Quinapril in chronic heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are now firmly established in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Their beneficial acute and chronic hemodynamic effects are not associated with reflex tachycardia or drug tolerance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce symptomatic improvement and improve exercise capacity in all grades of heart failure. They also improve the prognosis of patients with severe heart failure. Quinapril is a recently introduced, nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, whose intermediate half-life makes it well-suited for the treatment of patients with CHF. The acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of quinapril are similar to those of other ACE inhibitors. In a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 225 patients with mild to moderate CHF, 10 to 40 mg/day quinapril significantly improved clinical status and exercise capacity in a dose-related manner. The incidence of side effects did not differ significantly from that of placebo. The initial studies with quinapril are promising and warrant further clinical investigation of this compound. 
5	Six year follow up of infants with bacteriuria on screening. OBJECTIVE--To determine the value of screening for bacteriuria in infants with special emphasis on the natural course of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria, renal growth, and renal damage. DESIGN--Prospective six year follow up of infants with bacteriuria on screening in an unselected infant population. SETTING--Paediatric outpatient clinic. PATIENTS--50 Infants (14 girls, 36 boys) with bacteriuria on screening verified by suprapubic aspiration from an unselected population of 3581 infants in a defined area of Gothenburg. INTERVENTIONS--Children with asymptomatic bacteriuria and normal findings on initial urography were untreated, although other infections were treated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Culture of urine and determination of C reactive protein concentration every six weeks for the first six months after diagnosis, every three months from six months to two years, and every six months between two and three years; thereafter yearly urine culture. Evaluation of renal concentrating capacity with a desmopressin test; radiological examination, including first and follow up urography and micturition cystourethrography without antibiotic cover; and measurement of renal parenchymal thickness and renal surface area. RESULTS--Of the original 50 infants, 37 (12 girls, 25 boys) were followed up for at least six years. Two infants developed pyelonephritis within two weeks after bacteriuria was diagnosed; the others remained free of symptoms. 45 Infants were untreated; the bacteriuria cleared spontaneously in 36 and in response to antibiotics given for infections in the respiratory tract in eight. Recurrences of bacteriuria were observed in 10 of the 50 children, of whom one had pyelonephritis. No child had more than one recurrence. At follow up urography in 36 of the 50 children (9 girls, 27 boys) after a median of 32 months no child had developed renal damage. First samples tested for renal concentrating capacity showed significantly higher values than those from a reference population (mean SD score 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.79; p less than 0.001), but the last samples showed no significant difference (mean SD score 0.08, -0.24 to 0.40; p greater than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--Mass screening for bacteriuria in infancy results primarily in detection of innocent bacteriuric episodes and is not recommended. 
3	Myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus. Case report. The case of a myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus is presented. The clinical course is reported, and the frequency of the lesion, diagnostic workup, histopathology, and surgical therapy are discussed. 
5	Early diagnosis and surgical intervention of acute aortic dissection by transesophageal color flow mapping. To determine whether transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography (TEE) is useful for the early diagnosis and surgical intervention in acute aortic dissection, 57 serial patients with acute aortic dissection were examined. These patients were evaluated by TEE with either the single-plane probe (39 patients) or the biplanar probe (18 patients) just after admission. The intimal flap was detected in all patients, and there were 18 patients with type A dissection and 39 patients with type B dissection. The entry was visualized in 83% of type A dissection cases and in 90% of type B dissection cases. In two of 18 patients examined with the biplanar probe technique, the entry was detected in the longitudinal view only. Emergency operations were performed in 18 patients with type A dissection and in 10 patients with ruptured type B dissection. Twenty-nine of 39 patients with type B dissection were treated conservatively. The operative mortality rate of patients with type A dissection was 22%, and that of patients with ruptured type B dissection was 60%. The major advantage of TEE is its ease of application at the bedside or in the operating room, which allows immediate and accurate diagnosis of acute aortic dissection for emergency surgical intervention. Biplanar TEE provides additional acoustic windows, ease of spatial orientation, and more accurate visualization of entry. TEE is a useful and powerful diagnostic tool for acute aortic dissection, and by using this method, one may achieve a more rapid and aggressive surgical approach for patients with acute aortic dissection. 
3	Neurologic complications of the tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. A case of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia, central nervous system complications, and multiple white matter lesions by magnetic resonance imaging is presented. Eosinophilia regardless of its cause should be included within the differential of patients exhibiting periventricular white matter lesions. 
5	Mandibular reconstruction with composite microvascular tissue transfer. Microvascular free tissue transfer has provided a variety of methods of restoring vascularized bone and soft tissue to difficult defects created by tumor resection and trauma. Over 7 years, 26 patients have undergone 28 free flaps for mandibular reconstruction, 15 for primary squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth or tongue, 7 for recurrent tumor, and 6 for other reasons [lymphangioma (1), infection (1), gunshot wound (1), and osteoradionecrosis (3)]. Primary reconstruction was performed in 19 cases and secondary in 9. All repairs were composite flaps including 12 scapula, 5 radial forearm, 3 fibula, 2 serratus, and 6 deep circumflex iliac artery. Mandibular defects included the symphysis alone (7), symphysis and body (5), symphysis-body-ramus condyle (2), body or ramus (13), and bilateral body (1). Fourteen patients had received prior radiotherapy to adjuvant or curative doses. Eight received postoperative radiotherapy. All patients had initially successful vascularized reconstruction by clinical examination (28) and positive radionuclide scan (22 of 22). Bony stability was achieved in 25 of 26 patients and oral continence in 24 of 26. One complete flap loss occurred at 14 days. Complications of some degree developed in 22 patients including partial skin necrosis (3), orocutaneous fistula (3), plate exposure (1), donor site infection (3), fracture of reconstruction (1), and fracture of the radius (1). Microvascular transfer of bone and soft tissue allows a reliable reconstruction--despite previous radiotherapy, infection, foreign body, or surgery--in almost every situation in which mandible and soft tissue are absent. Bony union, a healed wound, and reasonable function and appearance are likely despite early fistula, skin loss, or metal plate or bone exposure. 
4	Primary varicose veins: topographic and hemodynamic correlations. This study was conducted to correlate the clinical presentations of uncomplicated primary varicose veins with the topographic and anatomic source of reflux (escape points). One-hundred sixty-three patients with primary varicose veins (144 females, 19 males; 96 unilateral, 67 bilateral) in 230 involved limbs were examined. The origin and extent of venous reflux was traced with Doppler ultrasound. Three distinct groups were recognized. Group I. Typical saphenous varicosities with junctional escapes occurred in 164 (71.3%). Sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) incompetence in 147, and sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ) incompetence in 17 limbs. Group II. Atypical saphenous varicosities with non-junctional escapes occurred in 51 (22.17%) limbs. In 5 limbs, no escape was detected. Twenty-two limbs had escapes localized in the main perforators: mid-thigh perforator 17, upper calf 2, distal ankle in 3. Twenty-four limbs had their escapes in the auxiliary perforators: abdomino-pelvic 17, and circumflex iliac/external epigastric, 7 limbs. Group III. Non saphenous (lateral venous system) varicosities occurred in 15 (6.52%) limbs. Based on physical examination alone, 55 limbs would possibly have undergone unnecessary ankle to groin stripping and 83 limbs an unnecessary SFJ ligation. Doppler US is an essential diagnostic tool that can accurately map the origin and extent of the venous reflux. The obtained hemodynamic information will permit more selective, multimodal therapy and avoid the indiscriminate, often unnecessary stripping of the entire saphenous system in all cases of primary varicose veins. 
2	Pemoline-associated hepatic injury. Among 100 cases of hepatic injury attributed to the administration of pemoline, 43 had sufficient accompanying information to permit analysis. All but two patients were less than 20 years old, and 80% were less than 12 years old. Males predominated the study. Injury appeared as early as 1 week or as late as greater than 1 year of taking the drug. The injury was uniformly hepatocellular as judged by the high values for aminotransferases and by death in massive necrosis in one patient. Mechanism was judged to be idiosyncratic, and the idiosyncrasy was probably metabolic rather than immunologic. 
1	Recent life change and large bowel cancer. Data from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. In a large, population based, epidemiological study of colorectal cancer, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study, several etiological factors were investigated. Persons' recent life changes, as well as the degree of upset they experienced as a result of these changes, were included. Interviews with 715 histologically confirmed new cases of colorectal cancer occurring over a 12-month period in Melbourne, Australia, and with 727 age and sex matched community controls were conducted. As one of the methods of assessing any effect of recall bias, 179 hospital controls were also investigated. Major illness or death of a family member, major family problems and major work problems were found to be significantly more common for cases over the 5 years preceding diagnosis compared to controls. Cases also reported being significantly more upset with their recent life changes than did controls. No significant differences in results were found between males and females, or between colon cancer and rectal cancer patients. Although the possibility of recall bias, was not completely controlled for in this study, it was probably not an important factor in explaining case-control differences. Recent life changes, and their perceptions, may have significance in the development of large bowel cancer. 
3	ACTH therapy in infantile spasms: relationship between dose of ACTH and initial effect or long-term prognosis. The relationship between the dose of ACTH and the initial effect was investigated in 41 children with infantile spasms. More than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day of ACTH was needed for a good initial response of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities. The relationship between the dose of ACTH and long-term prognosis was investigated in 29 patients. There was no relationship between the daily or total ACTH dosage, provided the dose was greater than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day, and the outcome of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities; however, ACTH 0.04-0.06 mg (1.6-2.4 IU)/kg/day and a total ACTH dose of 1.1-1.5 mg (44-60 IU)/kg resulted in better mental development than smaller doses of ACTH. Side effects of ACTH increased with dosage. Too small or too large a dose of ACTH does not lead to better mental development. The proper dose of ACTH should be used with careful attention to potential side effects. 
5	Prognostic factors in acute renal failure following aortic aneurysm surgery. This study analyses the prognostic factors associated with survival in 70 patients who developed acute renal failure following surgery for an aortic aneurysm. Forty-nine patients (70 per cent) had surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm and 21 patients (30 per cent) had an elective procedure. Fifty-nine patients received haemodialysis. Thirty-three patients (47 per cent) survived the episode of acute renal failure. Six of these thirty-three patients died within three months of recovering from acute renal failure, giving an overall survival of 27/70 (39 per cent). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors significantly adversely affected survival: a need for inotropic support, ventilation for more than three days and age over 65 years. A model developed using these variables provided a basis for predicting outcome. 
2	Colon interposition for esophageal disease: histologic finding of colonic mucosa after a follow-up of 5 months to 15 years. Thirty-six patients, subjected to colon interposition for benign esophageal disease or carcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cardia, were studied by endoscopy for signs of mucosal disease in the interposed colon. Five months to 15 yr (mean 57 months) after the operation, endoscopic finding of the interposed colon was macroscopically normal in 28 patients. Signs of inflammation, including hyperemia or hyperemia and friability, were observed in seven patients. Histologic specimens obtained at endoscopy were examined microscopically, and the findings were compared with those seen in the preoperative graft. In two patients, chronic inflammatory changes were observed in the graft mucosa, consisting of mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria accompanied by crypt dilatation and deformation. In one of these patients, the inflammation was in the proximal third of the graft, and it was also seen at the endoscopy. In the remaining 34 patients, the graft mucosa was microscopically comparable to normal. The alterations were unexpectedly few and mild considering the marked change in the location and function of the colonic segment. 
1	Immunohistochemical differentiation of basal cell epithelioma from cutaneous appendages using monoclonal anti-glycoprotein antibody TNKH1. Its application in Mohs' micrographic surgery. TNKH1, which was primarily developed to detect differentiated melanocytic tumor cells, was found to recognize basal keratinocytes of hair follicle and some basal keratinocytes of human epidermis. Thus, TNKH1 decorated the basal cells of following structures: epidermis (39 of 54, only part of each specimen [OPES]), upper hair follicle (one of 24, OPES), lower hair follicle (21 of 21, very high rate of each specimen [VHES]), sebaceous duct (14 of 15, VHES), sebaceous gland (ten of 14, germinative cells near duct), eccrine duct (three of 19, OPES). Epithelial tumors, considered to be derived from or differentiating toward hair follicle such as trichilemmoma (one of one, VHES) and basal cell epithelioma (BCE) (32 of 32, VHES) were labeled not only in the peripheral cells but in their entirety. On the other hand, epidermal tumors, such as seborrheic keratosis (ten of 11, OPES), actinic keratosis (two of three, OPES), and squamous cell carcinoma (one of two, OPES), showed an irregular peripheral basal cell staining as in normal epidermis. The apocrine sweat apparatus and eccrine secretory portion were negative. Eccrine ductal tumors such as syringoma (two tested), eccrine acrospiroma (one), and eccrine carcinoma (two) were TNKH1 negative. Taking advantage of this total labeling of BCE versus peripheral labeling of the hair follicle, the authors could distinguish BCE tissue from other structures clearly. Among confusing structures the upper hair follicle and the eccrine duct were excluded easily because of their negative staining with TNKH1. The lower hair follicle was TNKH1 positive but only in the outer basal layer, whereas the BCE was TNKH1 positive in its entire basaloid cells. The result indicated that TNKH1 will be a useful antibody in Mohs' micrographic surgery. 
2	Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. 
5	Local antibiotic delivery in the treatment of bone and joint infections. Antibiotics can be delivered locally via an implantable pump to treat bone and joint infections. This is a completely closed system, and the pump is refilled percutaneously at intervals based on its flow rate. The use of this method is described in three specific clinical situations: (1) resistant osteomyelitis (patients with persistent infections despite previous therapy), (2) acutely infected arthroplasties (symptomatic for less than six weeks), and (3) chronically infected arthroplasties (patients infected more than six weeks). In all three clinical situations, hospitalization time was shortened, and high local and low systemic levels of antibiotic were obtained. There was only one incident of side effects to the antibiotic used. This method has been successful in obtaining long-term suppression of infection in 30 of 42 patients with resistant osteomyelitis, 30 of 37 patients with acutely infected arthroplasties, and seven of ten patients with chronically infected arthroplasties. The complication unique to this method of therapy is pump-site and catheter-site infections. This occurred in three patients with recalcitrant osteomyelitis and three patients with acutely infected arthroplasties. 
2	Comparison of shunt fraction estimation using transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine and technetium-99m-pertechnetate in a group of dogs with experimentally-induced chronic biliary cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunt fraction estimation using transcolonic iodine-123-iodoamphetamine (IMP) has been previously validated relative to portal vein macroaggregated albumin injections using an experimental model of cirrhosis. Transcolonic technetium-99m-pertechnetate (TcO4-) has been proposed as an alternative tracer to IMP to study portal circulation in cirrhotic patients. We compared shunt fraction estimates from paired transcolonic IMP and TcO4- studies performed on a group of dogs before and after common bile duct ligation surgery. Pertechnetate over-estimated shunt fraction in 6/7 postoperative studies relative to IMP. A good correlation between the two methods was demonstrated, however, the slope of the regression line was substantially less than 1.0 with TcO4- values reaching 100% at IMP shunt values of approximately 60%. This apparent inability to accurately assess high shunt flows may limit the quantitative aspects of TcO4- studies on patients with severe portosystemic shunting. 
4	Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation: current status of total artificial heart in 1989 and determinants of survival. Since April 1986, 40 total artificial hearts (TAH) were implanted as a bridge to transplantation in our institution. In an attempt to identify factors affecting survival of TAH recipients we reviewed our experience over 1000 days of mechanical support. There was no postoperative bleeding requiring surgery nor were there any clinical episodes of thromboembolic complications. Over a total functioning period greater than 3 years there were no mechanical failures in the driving system but one artificial ventricle had to be replaced because of mechanical dysfunction. Infections and multiple organ failure were the primary causes of morbidity and mortality during mechanical support. When the patients who underwent staged transplantation (no. 17) were compared with those who died during mechanical support (no. 23) there were no differences in TAH driving mode or hemodynamic variables between the groups. Although preoperative pulmonary, hepatic and renal functions were found to be similar between the groups, there were significant differences in the early evolution (3 days) of hepatic and renal functions following TAH implant (p less than 0.01). Urinary output was found to be the earliest variable discriminating recovery and survival (p less than 0.01). Finally, univariate analysis indicated age (less than 40 vs greater than 40 years) and modality of cardiac decompensation (acute vs chronic) as the most important factors affecting survival after TAH implantation. Since young patients (less than 40 years of age) with acute decompensation were successfully transplanted in 82% of cases while 100% of older patients with chronic decompensation died before or after transplantation, TAH should be advised in young patients with acute or chronic heart failure and in selected older candidates with recent, acute cardiac failure. 
4	Impairment of the myocardial ultrastructure and changes of the cytoskeleton in dilated cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to determine the morphological correlate of chronic heart failure. Myocardial tissue from eight patients undergoing transplantation surgery because of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy was investigated by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against elements of the cytoskeleton: desmin, tubulin, vinculin, and vimentin. The tissue showed hypertrophy, atrophy of myocytes, and an increased amount of fibrosis. Ultrastructural changes consisted of enlargement and varying shape of nuclei, numerous very small mitochondria, proliferation of T tubules, and accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen. The most obvious ultrastructural alteration was the decrease of myofilaments, ranging from rarefication to complete absence of sarcomeres in cells filled with unspecified cytoplasm. Immunocytochemistry showed that desmin was localized at the Z lines. In diseased myocardium, the amount of desmin was increased, but it was disorderly arranged. Tubulin formed a fine network throughout the myocytes and was significantly increased in cardiomyopathic hearts. Vinculin, a protein closely associated with the cytoskeleton, occurred not only at the sarcolemma and the intercalated disc but also within the myocardial cells. Ultrastructural changes and alterations of the cytoskeleton were severe in about one third of all cells. About one third of all cells showed moderately severe changes, and the remaining cells were normal. Vimentin was present in the interstitial cells and was increased in relation to the increase of fibrosis. We conclude that the increase of fibrosis, the degeneration of hypertrophied myocardial cells, and the alterations of the cytoskeleton are the morphological correlates of reduced myocardial function in chronic heart failure. 
4	Short-term changes in renal function, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels in patients receiving cyclosporine for dermatologic disorders. We compared the changes in renal function, blood pressure (BP), and concentrations of serum potassium, magnesium, and urate (uric acid) in two groups of patients not given transplants. Group 1, comprising 21 psoriatic patients, was treated with 14 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 4 weeks in a prospective, placebo-controlled study; group 2, comprising 28 patients with diverse cutaneous diseases, was given 6 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 1 to 3 months in a prospective, open-labeled study. Renal function (determined by serum urea nitrogen [SUN] and creatinine levels and urinalysis), BP, serum electrolyte levels (potassium and magnesium), and urate level were measured weekly for the first 4 weeks in both groups, and then, after 2 and 3 months of therapy, in group 2 only. During the first 4 weeks in group 1 patients, there were significant increases in values of SUN, creatinine, BP, potassium, and urate, and a significant decrease in the serum magnesium value. When data for the two groups were combined, the changes from pretherapy values in each of the above measures (except systolic BP) during the first 4 weeks correlated significantly with cyclosporine trough levels. In group 2, the changes that occurred in the first 4 weeks in the SUN value, SUN/creatinine ratio, and BP were magnified over the subsequent 8 weeks of treatment. In the combined group for the first 4 weeks of therapy, duration of therapy, independent of cyclosporine trough levels, correlated with changes in SUN, creatinine, and urate levels, but not with changes in the potassium or magnesium level or in BP. We conclude that the cyclosporine blood level was a better discriminant than cyclosporine dosage in the analysis of renal dysfunction and hypertension in these patients. 
3	Bronchial mucus hypersecretion in acute quadriplegia. Macromolecular yields and glycoconjugate composition. In acute quadriplegia we have noted that about one in five patients develops unexplained production of markedly excessive and tenacious bronchial mucus. Spontaneous recovery from mucus hypersecretion usually occurs within weeks to months. Mucus samples collected from 12 patients have been found to be abnormal. Macromolecular contents of single aspirates yielded as much as 500 mg. Analytical ultracentrifuge analysis showed the mucus to contain considerable epithelial glycoprotein (GP) of typical buoyant density; its amino acid and carbohydrate compositions were characteristic of the GP from hypersecretory bronchial mucus such as in chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. In five patients studied after recovery from hypersecretion, there tended to be relatively less GP. The mucus samples contained a high density glycoconjugate (GC): this had sugars of GP but also reacted positively with a monoclonal antibody to keratan sulfate. Its amino acid composition was different from that of GP: threonine was lower and glycine was higher than in GP. In mucus from one patient who died, chondroitin sulfate ABC and hyaluronic acid were identified as well. This suggests proteoglycans are involved in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion. The sudden onset and spontaneous recovery of hypersecretion suggests that it is not due to gland hypertrophy. We speculate that in acute quadriplegia it is due to disturbed neuronal control of bronchial mucus gland secretion, perhaps related to initial disappearance and later reappearance of peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone. 
4	Angioplasty of occluded coronary arteries: use of thin shaft balloon over-the-wire system without pre-dilatation. A retrospective review was done on 13 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries using a recently released thin shaft balloon over-the-wire angioplasty system. Balloon size was determined by the closest fit to the arterial size and used without predilatation techniques. This technique was initially successful in 12 patients with only 2 clinically insignificant episodes of distal embolization and one probable early reclosure. Using thin shaft angioplasty systems, balloon dilatation of totally occluded coronary arteries can be done safely with a single balloon in many cases resulting in simplified procedures and economic benefits. 
4	Atrial fibrillation after stroke in the elderly. To examine the relationship between atrial fibrillation and mortality after stroke, we studied 186 men and 167 women from the Waikato Stroke Registry whose mean age was 75.2 +/- 7.5 years. Twenty-three percent (82 of 353) had atrial fibrillation or flutter on their admission electrocardiogram. This group differed significantly from that with sinus rhythm in three respects: 1) They were older (p less than 0.01); 2) they had more severe current stroke deficit as evidenced by lower limb power (p less than 0.05) and Mini-Mental State Score (p less than 0.001), higher incidence of homonomous hemianopia (p less than 0.05), and lower incidence of lacunar syndrome stroke (p less than 0.001); and 3) they had a significantly higher incidence of cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure (p less than 0.01). Functional outcome was insignificantly better in the group with sinus rhythm. During a mean follow-up period of 18 months, mortality was significantly higher in the group with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001). Proportional hazards modeling, however, showed that the apparently poorer survival in those patients with atrial fibrillation could be explained by factors other than cardiac rhythm, such as age, Mini-Mental State Score, level of consciousness, and interstitial edema on admission chest radiograph. Thus, atrial fibrillation was not an independent predictor of survival after stroke. 
2	The effect of posterior rectopexy on fecal continence. A prospective study. Twenty-three patients with rectal prolapse or intussusception were studied to specifically focus on the effect of posterior rectopexy on fecal continence, anal pressure, and rectal capacity. Before operation, five patients were fully continent (A), 10 were continent for solid stools (B) and eight patients were fully incontinent (C). Group A remained fully continent; continence was regained nine times in group B and in group C, three patients regained full continence, two became continent for solid stools, three patients remained incontinent. Other symptoms such as constipation, false urgency, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation were not beneficially influenced by rectopexy. The patients' continence status was correlated to anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurement. In group B, incremental pressure (P = squeeze - basal P) increased significantly (P less than 0.02) as well as incremental volume (V = maximum tolerated volume - volume of first sensation) (P less than 0.05). We conclude that, by an increase of incremental anal pressure and incremental rectal volume, posterior rectopexy offers an 83 percent chance of regaining full continence, or a major improvement, and a 17 percent chance of stabilization of fecal incontinence. 
3	Neurodevelopmental outcome of children with evidence of periventricular leukomalacia on late MRI. Fifteen children, 8 months of age or older, from a neonatal follow-up program underwent magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic, cognitive, and language evaluations. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in all children included increased white matter signal on T2-weighted images and ventricular enlargement adjacent to regions of abnormal white matter. The extent of degree of abnormal white matter signal and the degree of sulcal prominence were variable. Twelve children had cerebral palsy; 5 children, 4 of whom had cerebral palsy, manifested significant sensory impairments. The median score on cognitive testing was 89; only 2 children exhibited severe-to-profound cognitive disability. Cognitive scores were stable on retesting. The degree of motor disability was correlated with the extent of white matter signal abnormality; however, cognitive outcome was not related to the extent and degree of white matter signal abnormality or to the degree of sulcal prominence. Despite the association of a major handicapping condition and periventricular leukomalacia, cognitive and language functioning may be relatively spared. 
2	The management of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The management of nine patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei was reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection of tumor is the standard of treatment, with many patients requiring multiple laparotomies. Chemotherapy, including the use of cisplatin is not effective. Long-term nutritional support provides a better quality of survival for select patients. 
2	Binding to human jejunum of serum IgA antibody from children with coeliac disease. Jejunal histology and the presence of serum IgA antibodies (JAB) binding to human jejunum in vitro were studied in 139 children with severe malabsorptive symptoms. Among 33 children with confirmed coeliac disease (ESPGAN criteria), 13 (93%) of 14 sampled before starting on a gluten-free diet had JAB, none of 21 sampled had JAB while on a gluten-free diet of long duration, and 90% of 30 sampled during gluten challenge had JAB. 53 children had severe jejunal villous atrophy (probable coeliac disease): 71% of those younger than 2 years and 94% of those aged 2-18 years had JAB during gluten intake. JAB could not be detected in 53 disease control patients (normal jejunal histology) and in 3 coeliac disease patients with selective IgA deficiency. Simultaneous determination of antigliadin (AGA) and antiendomysium (EMA) levels, and gliadin and tissue absorption studies, showed that JAB and AGA are different, whereas JAB and EMA are probably identical. IgA JAB could be the target-organ-related autoantibodies in coeliac disease. 
1	Pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the findings in a patient with shortness of breath due to pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy. Mediastinal recurrence of an incompletely resected and slowly growing adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left main bronchus had encased the right main pulmonary artery. 
1	The role of attitudes, beliefs, and personal characteristics of Italian physicians in the surgical treatment of early breast cancer. The influence of Italian physicians' attitudes, beliefs, and personal characteristics on medical decision making is examined in the case of surgical treatment of early breast cancer. Responses to a mail survey of 657 physicians from different specialties were analyzed comparing doctors recommending a radical procedure (9%) to those preferring a conservative procedure for younger patients only (25%), and those considering conservative surgery the treatment of choice regardless of patients' age (66%). The findings suggest that the likelihood of physicians' preferring a conservative procedure is influenced by their specialty and the extent to which they feel that a patient should have a role in the treatment decision more than by differences in the beliefs of treatment outcomes. Only preferences of the small group indicating radical surgery as the sole admissible treatment can be accounted for by ignorance or distrust of results of recent trials. These findings suggest that other than scientific factors guide many doctors in their decision making; they may help to explain why the diffusion of research results into clinical practice is often disappointingly slow. 
2	A comparison in vitro of human and rabbit distal colonic muscle responses to inflammatory mediators. The present study compared in vitro the motor responses of human and rabbit distal colonic longitudinal and circular muscle to acetylcholine, histamine, leukotrienes B4 and D4, and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. The active and passive mechanical properties of these muscles were also evaluated. All muscle types were contracted by acetylcholine and histamine. Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive. Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied. Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species. Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied. Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related. Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined. Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis. All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo. These data strongly support the belief that after the onset of an induced colitis, the rabbit colon has value as a predictive model for the study of inflammatory mediator-induced colonic motility changes in humans. 
5	Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons. Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone. Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors. 
3	Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy. The variety of cognitive dysfunctions related to learning disabilities in children with epilepsy have been studied by linking electroencephalogram (EEG) and computerized neuropsychological testing. This showed that "subclinical" discharges impaired performance in 61% of the patients on a simple and a choice reaction time test, although some discharges lasted 1 s only. Neuropsychological investigation of subclinical EEG discharges may help to determine their adverse effect on learning. 
1	Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease. 
4	The role of chronotropic impairment during exercise after the Mustard operation. To better understand the role of chronotropic impairment on exercise performance after the atrial switch (Mustard) operation, 20 patients who had undergone this operation for uncomplicated d-transposition of the great arteries exercised to maximal volition using a 1 min incremental treadmill protocol. Heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and minute ventilation were monitored continuously. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained before testing to calculate the right ventricular inflow volume indexed to body surface area. All patients achieved maximal aerobic capacity based on their ventilatory patterns and respiratory exchange ratio. Maximal heart rate was reduced (175 beats/min; 87% of predicted for age) and maximal oxygen consumption was decreased (31 ml/kg per min; 75% of predicted for age and gender). There was no correlation between maximal oxygen consumption and maximal heart rate. Right ventricular volume index, however, had a significant inverse correlation with maximal heart rate (r = -0.62, p less than 0.005). There was no correlation between right ventricular volume index and heart rate at rest. These results suggest that decreased maximal oxygen consumption in patients after the Mustard procedure is not a result of chronotropic impairment. Right ventricular dilation may be a compensatory response to chronotropic impairment. 
4	The costs of prevention. A prevention program is cost-effective if it yields more health benefits than do alternative uses of health care resources. Some prevention programs meet this standard: either they actually save more health care resources than they utilize, or their net costs per healthy year of life gained are lower than those of alternatives such as curative or palliative medicine. Other prevention programs, however, are less cost-effective than are medical treatments for the same disease. One lesson for public policy is that generalizations about the cost-effectiveness of "prevention" are unwise. Another lesson is that prevention programs should not be subjected to a higher standard than other health programs: they should not be expected to save money, but they should be expected to yield improved health at a reasonable price. 
4	Geographical clustering of risk factors and lifestyle for coronary heart disease in the Scottish Heart Health Study. A large cross sectional study, the Scottish Heart Health Study, of 10,359 men and women from 22 districts of Scotland was undertaken to try to explain the geographical variation of coronary heart disease mortality. Analysis by district showed that of the classic risk factors only cigarette smoking was strongly associated with heart disease mortality among both men and women. Mean diastolic blood pressure was weakly associated with rates among men and high density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a strong negative association among women. Total cholesterol showed a weak negative association with heart disease mortality, but, because the serum concentrations of cholesterol were uniformly high in all districts, a strong association with mortality would not be expected. In both men and women many dietary factors showed moderate or strong associations with mortality from coronary heart disease in a district--of these a low consumption of vitamin C was most notable. Other factors associated with heart disease included alcohol consumption and serum triglycerides among men, and obesity, physical activity, and serum triglycerides among women. Many factors associated with heart disease showed strong intercorrelations. Clustering of risk factors (including smoking, alcohol, and diet among men, and smoking, diet, and obesity among women) was associated with much of the regional variation in heart disease mortality in Scotland. 
2	Proximal gastric vagotomy: follow-up at 10-20 years. From August 1969 to December 1989, 600 patients had elective proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulceration with an operative mortality of 0.2 per cent. Of these, 372 patients had surgery over 10 years ago. Three hundred and forty-two patients survived for more than 10 years and, in a prospective study, 305 were reviewed, forming the basis of this 10-20-year follow-up report. Forty-six (15 per cent) have had recurrent ulceration; 80 per cent of these developed symptoms within 5 years and no patient has had recurrence after 13 years. Although 29 patients required reoperation for recurrent ulceration, the current patient satisfaction rate for Visick grades I and II is 92 per cent. Only two patients required reoperation because of gastric stasis. It is concluded that proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe and satisfactory first choice operation for duodenal ulceration. 
5	Dietary deficiency of antioxidants exacerbates ischemic injury in the rat kidney. We examined the effects of dietary deficiency of vitamin E and selenium on the ischemia-reperfusion model of renal injury in the rat. Deficient diets imposed for six weeks on three-week-old weanling rats led to no significant differences in body weights, serum creatinine, GFR, RBF, TmPAH or urinary total protein excretory rates prior to ischemia. Twenty-four hours after one hour of ischemia, animals on the deficient diet demonstrated more markedly impaired GFR, RBF, TmPAH and urine to plasma creatinine concentrations and an increased renal failure index. Tubular damage was more severe injury in the deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation, 15 minutes after the release of the ischemic clamp, was increased in the deficient animals. We confirmed the effects of our dietary manipulation in impairing the oxidant scavenging system in the deficient animals since glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced to less than 5% in the basal state, and this striking reduction persisted following ischemia. Plasma vitamin E concentrations were also markedly depressed in the deficient diets. This dietary deficiency also worsened the course of acute renal injury and was accompanied by 50% mortality compared to 0% mortality in the control animals. Thus, dietary deficiency of vitamin E and selenium led to greater structural and functional renal impairment and increased lipid peroxidation following ischemia. These data provide support for the role of reactive oxygen species in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
3	"Pseudospasticity" in Guillain-Barre syndrome. We report a woman with Guillain-Barre syndrome who developed a flexion posture of the right arm and hand resembling upper motor neuron dysfunction. EMG demonstrated that involuntary peripherally generated continuous motor unit discharges caused the posture. 
5	Influence of bone mineral density on the fixation of thoracolumbar implants. A comparative study of transpedicular screws, laminar hooks, and spinous process wires. Posteriorly directed load to failure testing of four different types of spinal implants was performed in individual T5 to S1 vertebra harvested from seven fresh-frozen human cadaveric spines. The implants tested were: 1) Drummond spinous process wires, 2) Harrington laminar hooks, 3) Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular screws, and 4) Steffee VSP transpedicular screws. The ultimate failure of each implant was compared with the bone mineral density of each vertebra to determine which implants, if any, were particularly advantageous in osteoporotic vertebrae. Before biomechanical testing, the spines were analyzed in vitro by dual photon absorptiometry to determine the bone mineral densities (gm/cm2) of each vertebra. The mean tensile loads to failure for each of the implants tested were as follows: Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular screws: 345 Newtons; spinous process wire/button: 382 Newtons; Steffee transpedicular screws: 430 Newtons; and laminar hooks: 646 Newtons. The difference between the loads to failure for laminar hooks and the other implants was significant (P less than 0.05) using one-way analysis of variance. The overall correlation coefficient for bone mineral density with ultimate load to failure was 0.30 (P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficients were 0.47 (P less than 0.001) for spinous process wires alone; 0.096 (not significant) for laminar hooks alone; 0.37 (P less than 0.001) for Cotrel-Dubousset pedicle screws; and 0.48 (P less than 0.001) for Steffee pedicle screws. Of the four different implants tested, laminar hooks were most resistant to failure from posteriorly directed forces. 
3	A placebo-controlled trial of maintenance therapy with fluconazole after treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of relapse after primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis remains high. We conducted a controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with fluconazole. At entry into the study, all participants had sterile cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine after following a standardized course of therapy for culture-proved cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were randomly assigned to take either fluconazole or placebo as maintenance therapy. The dose of fluconazole was 100 mg daily in the first phase of study and 200 mg daily in the second phase. RESULTS. Of 84 patients initially enrolled, 16 (19 percent) were found to have silent, persistent infection on the basis of cultures that became positive after entry into the study; 7 other patients were lost to follow-up shortly after entry. Of the remaining 61 patients, 10 of 27 assigned to placebo (37 percent) and 1 of 34 assigned to fluconazole (3 percent) had a recurrence of cryptococcal infection at any site (difference in risk, 34 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 53). Of the 11 recurrent infections, 7 were detected in urine obtained after prostatic massage. There were four recurrent meningeal infections in the patients taking placebo, but none in those taking fluconazole (mean duration of follow-up, 164 days) (P = 0.03). In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of recurrence-free survival were fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02; relative hazard, 13.2), a lower serum cryptococcal-antigen titer (P = 0.05; relative hazard, 1.2), and more prolonged primary therapy with flucytosine (P = 0.09; relative hazard, 1.1). Survival and toxicity were similar in the two maintenance-treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with AIDS, silent persistent infection is common after clinically successful treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole is highly effective in preventing recurrent cryptococcal infection. 
5	Adenine nucleotide changes in kidney, liver, and small intestine during different forms of ischemic injury. The purpose of this study was to better characterize renal adenine nucleotide pool responses to different forms of shock, contrast the changes to those found in other intra-abdominal organs (the liver and small intestine), and assess whether these changes are closely mimicked by those produced by renal arterial occlusion, the usual method used to study ischemic acute renal failure. Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock, septic shock, or cardiopulmonary shock of varying severities and durations. The liver consistently had the greatest energy depletion, followed by the kidney, and then the small intestine. However, only the kidney developed clear morphological damage (S3 brush border sloughing). Kidney adenylate pools were better preserved during septic shock and cardiopulmonary shock than during hemorrhagic shock despite comparable blood pressures. Only profound hemorrhagic shock (35-40 mm Hg for 25 minutes) decreased total adenylate pools (ATP + ADP + AMP). However, the degree of renal catabolite (nucleosides plus purine base) accumulation did not correlate with the amount of renal total adenine nucleotide depletion, partially because circulating catabolites contributed to intrarenal catabolite pools. Purine base/uric acid ratios differed among shocked organs, consistent with different degrees of xanthine oxidase activity (small intestine greater than liver greater than kidney). Renal morphological damage decreased during the immediate (0-30 minutes) postshock period, and the extent of this improvement was not altered by xanthine oxidase inhibition (oxypurinol), suggesting that the immediate postshock period is not one of serious oxidative injury. Shock, in comparison with renal arterial occlusion, caused only modest ATP loss/catabolite accumulation, very low purine base/uric acid ratios, and no immediate-reperfusion (0-30 minutes) resynthesis of the total adenylate pool. Thus, ischemia-induced renal adenylate changes may differ considerably, depending on the nature of the ischemic event. 
1	Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas. We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses. Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation. Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue. We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas. 
1	Potent selective inhibition of 7-O-methyl UCN-01 against protein kinase C. UCN-01 is a staurosporine-related compound that was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. and shows potent and selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C. Cellular inhibitory activity of UCN-01 against protein kinase C and cytotoxicity of UCN-01 were compared with those of staurosporine. When the mechanism of inhibitory activity was investigated in vitro, UCN-01 as well as staurosporine inhibited the activity of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C. In spite of direct inhibition against the catalytic domain of protein kinase C, cytotoxicity of UCN-01 was much lower than that of staurosporine. In addition, UCN-01 showed more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did staurosporine because of the sole structural difference at C-7. Therefore, a series of 7-O-alkyl derivatives of UCN-01 was synthesized and investigated. Interestingly, one of the compounds, the beta-methoxy derivative, showed 3-fold greater potency and 17-fold more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did UCN-01. 
5	Thyroiditis. Acute, subacute, and chronic. Inflammatory diseases of the thyroid are collectively the commonest thyroid disorder. Individually, they range from the rare case of acute bacterial thyroiditis to the other end of the spectrum, the even rarer Riedel's thyroiditis. Relatively common thyroid inflammatory diseases include the subacute thyroiditis syndromes. Of particular interest to endocrinologists is that both subacute granulomatous (painful) thyroiditis and subacute lymphocytic (painless) thyroiditis are very similar in terms of clinical course, although most likely have different etiologies. Nevertheless, their similarities suggest the possibility that there may be etiologic heterogeneity for the syndromes. From a clinical standpoint, it is essential to differentiate subacute painless thyroiditis from Graves' disease, because these two disorders also may mimic each other, yet only Graves' disease requires specific therapy. Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, the commonest of the thyroiditides, presents with goiter and either hyperthyroidism (uncommon), hypothyroidism (common), or euthyroidism (most common). When L-T4 therapy is used in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the physician must be alert to the possibility of excess thyroid hormone administration. Sensitive TSH measurements help to avoid this therapeutic pitfall. 
5	Immunological studies before and during interferon therapy in chronic HBV infection: identification of factors predicting response. Lymphoblastoid interferon is effective therapy in some but not all patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. To assess whether immunological parameters were predictive of response to interferon therapy, we determined the human leukocyte antigen type, CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer cell activity, IgM anti-HBc antibody levels and concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferative response in 30 patients before treatment. In addition, to investigate the mechanisms of action of interferon in promoting hepatitis B virus clearance, we serially measured the CD4/CD8 ratios, natural killer activity and lymphocyte proliferative response at wk 4, 8 and 12 of treatment. A beneficial response to therapy was defined as the sustained clearance of HBeAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA within 1 yr of commencing therapy. Elevated IgM anti-HBc levels were associated with a beneficial response to therapy, but there was no correlation observed between response and pretreatment CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer activity or lymphocyte proliferative response. Six of seven human leukocyte antigen DR3-positive patients responded. No measurable changes in the immunological parameters studied were observed in the nonresponder group, whereas a significant rise in CD4/CD8 ratio, associated with a fall in peripheral CD8 number and a decline in measurable NK activity, was seen in the responder group. These changes were maximal at the time of hepatitis B virus DNA clearance, which was associated with a transient increase in hepatic inflammation. 
5	Observer reliability in detecting surreptitious random occlusions of the monaural esophageal stethoscope. The esophageal stethoscope is used often during anesthesia to monitor ventilation and cardiac function. Deficiencies in observer vigilance may limit the effectiveness of this monitoring instrument. The aim of this study was to determine how long it took for an observer to detect a surreptitiously occluded monaural esophageal stethoscope in the setting of clinical anesthesia. During routine anesthesia, where an esophageal stethoscope was in use, a computer-guided device would artificially, silently, and at random time intervals, occlude the stethoscope tubing. Personnel using the stethoscope noted when they perceived the absence of stethoscope sounds. We studied 320 stethoscope occlusions in 32 patients. The time between stethoscope occlusion and detection was 34 +/- 59 seconds (mean +/- SD). Eighty-seven percent of detections were made in less than 60 seconds. However, 13% of detections were delayed for more than 60 seconds, and 2.3% for more than 240 seconds. While anesthesia personnel using an esophageal stethoscope could detect most stethoscope occlusions, failure to appreciate such episodes occurred in a small but significant number of cases. This suggests that the esophageal stethoscope has some definite limitations as a continuous monitor and that other monitoring techniques, such as oximetry, capnography, and ventilator disconnect alarms, as well as visual/tactile inspection of the patient, should be used as well. 
5	Postnatal epilepsy after EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures. We examined infants whose neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal EEG tracings to determine the types and frequency of postnatal epilepsy (PNE)--unprovoked, recurring postnatal seizures. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to PNE. Forty infants with EEG-documented neonatal seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed for a mean of 31 months. PNE developed in 56% (15 of 27) of the cohort. The first seizure appeared at a mean-corrected age of 12.7 months and occurred despite ongoing antiepileptic medication in 60% (9 of 15) of the group. Seizures were classified as infantile spasms or minor motor (7 patients), complex partial (4 patients), or generalized tonic-clonic (4 patients). Perinatal variables that significantly correlated with PNE included the presence of coma but not the age at seizure onset, the estimated gestational age, or Apgar scores. PNE occurred in 68% (13 of 19) of patients with moderately or markedly abnormal EEG backgrounds but in only 25% (2 of 8) without (p = 0.035). There was a strong trend for PNE to develop in patients with greater than 10 electrographic seizures per hour but in only 45% (9 of 20) of infants with fewer seizures (p = 0.058). Several postnatal variables were significantly related to PNE--the presence of cerebral palsy (CP), mental retardation (MR), CP with MR, and follow-up EEGs. PNE occurred in only 27% (3 of 11) of patients without spikes or sharp waves on postnatal EEGs performed at age 3 months but in 100% (3 of 3) of patients with spikes or sharp waves (p = 0.022). 
1	Kaposi's sarcoma of the colon in a young HIV-negative woman with Crohn's disease. We report a case of isolated colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a 36-year-old HIV-negative woman with refractory Crohn's disease of the colon and perineum following 11 months' treatment with azathioprine. The clinical features of this case are quite different from those classically described in Kaposi's sarcoma. Among the known risk factors, iatrogenic immunosuppression would appear to be the most probable. 
5	Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea. An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois. Seventy-two individuals were affected. Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea. 
3	Extracranial repair of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas: technique and results in 37 patients. Although neurosurgeons have traditionally preferred intracranial repair for the management of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, this approach is associated with the complications of a craniotomy, anosmia, and a high incidence of recurrent fistulas. Extracranial repair, on the other hand, produces no central nervous system morbidity, preserves olfaction, and is associated with a low incidence of recurrence. Although there have been several reports of extracranial repair of CSF fistulas by otorhinolaryngologists, this approach has received scant mention in the neurosurgical literature. We report here our experience with 37 patients with CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea who underwent extracranial repair. The etiology of the fistula was postoperative in 22, traumatic in 6, and spontaneous in 9. The fistulas were repaired using one of four techniques: external ethmoid-sphenoid in 18 patients, transmastoid in 9, transseptosphenoid in 7, and osteoplastic frontal sinusotomy in 3. In 32 of the 37 patients (86%) the fistulas were successfully repaired with the initial procedure. Of the 5 patients requiring a second operation, the fistula was successfully closed in 4 for an overall success rate of 97%. Complications were few and consisted of a transient facial paresis in a patient undergoing transmastoid repair and one death from meningitis. The authors conclude that because of low morbidity and mortality and a high success rate in closing fistulas, extracranial repair is the preferred technique for the operative management of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea. 
5	Clinical outcome of seriously ill surgical patients with intra-abdominal infection depends on both physiologic (APACHE II score) and immunologic (DTH score) alterations. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and the APACHE II score in 118 patients with surgical infections were measured prospectively and related to outcome. Logistic regression analysis generated the equation: [formula: see text]. The risk assessment as calculated by this model was compared to that using the APACHE II system alone in a separate group of 354 patients. There was an improvement in the predictive capacity of the APACHE II + DTH equation compared to APACHE II alone, as shown by a better fit of expected and observed deaths, an improved Goodman-Kruskal G statistic, and a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. It is concluded that the DTH response (a broad marker of immunocompetence) is an independent prognostic factor in surgical patients and can be used in combination with the APACHE II score (a measure of acute physiology) to estimate better the outcome of surgical patients. 
3	Stroke recurrence within 2 years after ischemic infarction. We prospectively studied stroke recurrence in 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank. Median follow-up was 13 months. The 2-year cumulative recurrence rate among these patients was 14.1%. Age, sex, race, history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or transient ischemic attacks, and stroke location were not associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence. Patients with an elevated blood pressure, an abnormal initial computed tomogram, or a history of diabetes mellitus were at a higher risk of stroke recurrence. In contrast, patients with an infarct of unknown cause were at a lower risk of stroke recurrence than patients with a defined stroke mechanism, such as lacune, embolism, or atherosclerosis. A multivariate model suggests that patients at the lowest risk for stroke recurrence have a low diastolic blood pressure, no history of stroke, no history of diabetes mellitus, and an infarct of unknown cause. 
1	Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease. The relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown. We investigated the frequency of H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H. pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H. pylori. We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51. Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H. pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2. Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7. Acid secretion was lower in the H. pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H. pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively). The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that H. pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The association of a reduced BAO with H. pylori suggests that these findings may be related. 
5	Acute pelvic inflammatory disease after surgical sterilization. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Physicians are very cognizant of the possibility of pregnancy after surgical sterilization, but the potential for acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is thought to be rare. This study was undertaken to determine if upper tract PID occurred more frequently than previously reported in patients remote from surgical sterilization. DESIGN: Retrospective review of hospitalized patients with the primary discharge diagnosis of PID. SETTING: Urban, university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixty-four hospitalized patients with the primary discharge diagnosis of PID over a six-year study period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients' age; gynecologic histories and diagnoses; and laboratory, clinical, and surgical findings were noted. Twenty-three cases of acute PID were identified in 21 patients previously sterilized (6%). Nine of the 23 cases had systemic toxicity warranting surgical evaluation; 18 of the 23 cases were admitted from the emergency department. Mean statistical characteristics of the study group were age, 27.3 +/- 0.8 (SE) years; time interval from sterilization, 49.8 +/- 7.4 months; WBC 15,000 +/- 1,200; and temperature, 38.0 +/- 0.2 C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that acute PID may occur more frequently than previously reported in patients with prior surgical sterilization. An increased awareness of this entity is warranted. 
1	DNA aneuploidy in follicular thyroid neoplasia. The potential value of DNA aneuploidy, in distinguishing benign from malignant follicular thyroid neoplasms, was studied. The nuclear DNA content of 65 follicular thyroid neoplasms (52 adenomas and 13 carcinomas) was determined by flow cytometric analysis of paraffin embedded material; in 58 cases preparations were technically satisfactory. In 22 follicular neoplasms DNA analysis was also performed on fresh material obtained by fine needle aspiration of surgical specimens. Cell cycle analysis was performed on both fresh and fixed specimens. An aneuploid DNA profile was found on analysis of fixed tissue in eight of 45 (18 per cent) follicular adenomas and four of 13 (31 per cent) follicular carcinomas. DNA aneuploidy was also found in six of the 22 (27 per cent) fresh preparations from follicular adenomas. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy in apparently benign and malignant follicular neoplasms was similar. Follicular thyroid neoplasia are best regarded as a single entity with a low incidence of local and distant spread. All follicular neoplasia are therefore best excised. 
1	Post-chemotherapy tumor residuals in patients with advanced nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Is it necessary to resect all residual masses? A total of 15 patients with advanced nonseminomatous testicular cancer underwent 2 sequential operations (4 in 1 patient) to remove residual masses after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. All patients had normal human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels but persistent radiographic masses after chemotherapy. The operations included retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in 13 patients, thoracotomy in 15, hepatic resection in 3 and craniotomy in 1. Histological comparison of the specimens resected during post-chemotherapy operations 1 and 2 demonstrated different patterns in 7 of 15 patients. Of these 7 patients 4 had less favorable pathological features in the specimen removed during the second procedure. Residual malignant tumor or mature teratoma was found in at least 1 site in 12 of the 15 patients and only 3 had complete necrosis or fibrosis in both specimens examined. These data indicate the favorable impact of excising all post-chemotherapy tumor residuals in patients with advanced nonseminomatous testicular cancer. However, in patients with no teratomatous elements in the testicular tumor and complete necrosis or fibrosis in the initial post-chemotherapy operation specimen the probability of complete necrosis or fibrosis in remaining tumors appears to be high. 
1	Methionine dependency of malignant tumors: a possible approach for therapy When methionine (Met), an essential amino acid, was substituted for by its precursor homocysteine (Hcy) in the culture medium, normal cells such as fibroblasts proliferated normally. In contrast, many tumor cells failed to grow or grew at a lower rate. Met dependency is acquired simultaneously with cell transformation, as observed with HBL 100, a human mammary epithelial cell line that acquired increased malignancy as a function of in vitro passage number, and NIH/3T3 (J10), a mouse fibroblast line transformed by transfection with the human HRAS oncogene. A relationship was observed between Met dependency and metastatic potential of the RMS-21, RMS-S4T, and RMS-J1 sublines derived from RMS-0, a rat rhabdomyosarcoma cell line: the higher the metastatic potential of the cell line, the higher the concentration of Met required to maintain its proliferation. Met-independent cells derived from the RMS-0 line, obtained by a progressive decrease of Met in the culture medium lost their tumorigenicity when injected into rats fed with Met-deprived diets. In addition, the in vitro motility of RMS-S4T tumor cells, a marker of metastatic capability, decreased in Met-free Hcy-complemented (Met- Hcy+) medium. Similarly, RMS-0 tumor cells, preincubated in a Met- Hcy+ culture medium for 24 hours, evidenced a decreased capacity to form lung colonies when injected into syngeneic rats: the median number of lung colonies was 27 and 3 (P less than .05) for cells cultivated in Met+ Hcy- and Met- Hcy+ media, respectively. An amino acid-defined mixture reproducing casein composition was used as a protein source in the diets fed to RMS-J1 tumor-bearing rats. Dietary substitution of Hcy for Met (i.e., met deprivation) resulted in decreased tumor growth (from 44.4 +/- 1.0 to 40.6 +/- 1.4; P less than .05) and prevention of metastatic spread (from 37 to 0; P less than .05). In conclusion, exogenous Met can be substituted for Hcy to maintain the survival of normal cells but is essential for tumor cell growth in vivo as well as in vitro. Therefore, this defect of cancerous versus normal cells could be used for a therapeutic purpose. 
3	Cognitive deficits in children: adaptive behavior and treatment techniques. Impaired cognitive functioning impedes the development of age-appropriate adaptive behavior, thus adding to the burdens of many children with epilepsy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment can identify the underlying ability-related impairments that contribute to the adaptive behavior deficiencies evidenced, particularly in the home and school settings. This information can serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary treatment plan tailored to individual needs. Ideally, the need for such a treatment plan should be perceived early in childhood, so that it can be developed and applied preventively. The same remedial principles also apply in older children and are here set out in detail. 
4	Upward shift of the lower range of coronary flow autoregulation in hypertensive patients with hypertrophy of the left ventricle BACKGROUND. At any given perfusion pressure, coronary reserve is expressed by the difference between autoregulated and maximally vasodilated flow. In hypertension the raised coronary resistance reduces the steepness of the pressure-flow relationship at maximal vasodilatation. In the presence of cardiac hypertrophy the line of autoregulated flow becomes higher. For these reasons coronary reserve is reduced and the point at which baseline flow approaches the maximal achievable flow might be shifted to a higher perfusion pressure. Thus, any reduction below this elevated and critical value of pressure would lower the coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS. The investigated patients were normotensive (controls, nine) and hypertensive with normal (group I, seven) or augmented LV mass index because of concentric LV hypertrophy (group II, eight). All had effort-induced angina and angiographically normal left epicardial branches. Flow in the great cardiac vein was measured by thermodilution in the baseline and during stepwise (5 mm Hg every 5 minutes) decrease of the coronary perfusion pressure with a titrated nitroprusside i.v. infusion; perfusion pressures of 60 mm Hg in the controls and 70 mm Hg in the hypertensives were taken as end points. Baseline flow averaged 102 ml/min in normotensives, 104 ml/min in hypertensive group I and 148 ml/min in hypertensive group II. At the end points flow was similar to baseline in the controls and group I. In group II coronary flow started to decline and myocardial O2 extraction started to slightly but significantly rise at perfusion pressures of 90-80 mm Hg; at the end point flow was reduced by 26% (p less than 0.01 from baseline). The perfusion patterns did not seem to be related to the changes in tension-time index and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS. The association of high blood pressure (reduced ability of the coronary arterioles to dilate) and hypertrophy of the myocardium (augmented baseline coronary flow) may shift the point of exhaustion of coronary reserve to a higher perfusion pressure and make the myocardium vulnerable to treatment-induced relative hypertension. 
2	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of doxacurium in normal patients and in those with hepatic or renal failure. We determined the pharmacokinetics and duration of action of a bolus dose of doxacurium (15 micrograms/kg) in 27 patients anesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. Nine patients had normal renal and liver functions and were undergoing a variety of surgical procedures, nine were undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation because of end-stage renal disease, and nine were undergoing cadaveric liver transplantation because of end-stage hepatocellular disease. Plasma concentrations of doxacurium were measured for 6 h after administration using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatographic assay. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method based on statistical moments. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by measuring the electromyographic evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The degree of neuromuscular blockade after doxacurium administration was described as the percent of control of the first train-of-four response. The pharmacokinetic variables were (normal vs hepatic failure vs renal failure, respectively): volume of distribution at steady state (220 +/- 110 vs 290 +/- 60 vs 270 +/- 130 mL/kg [mean +/- SD]), plasma clearance (2.7 +/- 1.6 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4 vs 1.2 +/- 0.7 mL.kg-1.min-1), mean residence time (95.2 +/- 57 vs 129.4 +/- 30 vs 270 +/- 210 min), and elimination half-life (99 +/- 54 vs 115 +/- 31 vs 221 +/- 156 min). Plasma clearance and mean residence time differed significantly between patients with renal failure and control patients. 
3	Epidural haematoma requiring surgical decompression following repeated cervical epidural steroid injections for chronic pain. We report a case of epidural haematoma following a steroid injection into the cervical epidural space. The complication occurred on the seventh such injection over a 2 year period for chronic spinal pain. Surgical decompression over the seventh cervical and the upper 3 thoracic vertebrae was required to alleviate the symptoms of paralysis and anaesthesia. The patient subsequently required skin grafting to the surgical site and two trans-urethral resections of the prostate gland during his 6 week hospital admission. He made a full recovery. 
1	Activation of erythropoietin receptors by Friend viral gp55 and by erythropoietin and down-modulation by the murine Fv-2r resistance gene. The leukemogenic membrane glycoprotein (gp55) encoded by Friend spleen focus-forming virus appears to bind to erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) sto stimulate erythroblastosis [Li, J.-P., D'Andrea, A.D., Lodish, H.F. & Baltimore, D. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 762-764]. To directly compare the effects of gp55 with erythropoietin (Epo), we produced retrovirions that encode either gp55, Epo, or EpoR. After infection with EpoR virus, interleukin 3-dependent DA-3 cells bound 125I-labeled Epo and grew without interleukin 3 in the presence of Epo. These latter cells, but not parental DA-3 cells, became factor-independent after superinfection either with Epo virus or with Friend spleen focus-forming virus. In addition, Epo virus caused a disease in mice that mimicked Friend erythroleukemia. Although Fv-2r homozygotes are susceptible to all other retroviral diseases, they are resistant to both Epo viral and Friend viral erythroleukemias. These results indicate that both gp55 and Epo stimulate EpoR and that the Fv-2 gene encodes a protein that controls response to these ligands. However, the Fv-2 protein is not EpoR because the corresponding genes map to opposite ends of mouse chromosome 9. These results have important implications for understanding signal transduction by EpoR and the role of host genetic variation in controlling susceptibility to an oncogenic protein. 
5	The surgical pathologist's role in liver transplantation. Liver transplantation has become an option in treating a wide variety of diseases. The surgical pathologist, as a member of the transplantation team, is increasingly involved in the evaluation of allograft dysfunction. Interpretation of the liver allograft biopsy specimen requires integration of clinical history, biochemical data, and histologic patterns of a wide variety of lesions, including harvesting injury, vascular thrombosis, rejection, infection, and recurrent disease. This article reviews the varied histologic appearances of the more common forms of liver allograft injury, the contexts in which they arise, and their distinction from one another. 
4	Relation between three-dimensional geometry of the inflow tract to the orifice and the area, shape, and velocity of regurgitant color Doppler jets: an in vitro study. The relation between three-dimensional geometry of the inflow tract to the orifice and the area, shape, and velocity of regurgitant jets was studied in a pulsatile in vitro color Doppler flow model. A 2.5 MHz transducer connected to a diagnostic ultrasound machine was placed in a water tank facing pulsatile jets (duration, 0.5 second) obtained by a calibrated injector. Flow rate from 6 to 52 ml/sec were tested through a 5 mm diameter circular orifice. Four different three-dimensional inflow tract geometries were compared: (A) sharp-edged, (B) Venturi (funnel), (C) converging conical, and (D) diverging conical. Mean velocities of jets were measured by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. Driving pressures were also measured by means of a fluid-filled catheter. Two observers independently digitized contours of maximal color jet areas by computer system from two separate sets of experiments. Results are given as the mean values of the four measurements for each parameter. Jet areas were correlated to flow rate, with no difference from A through D. The shape (eccentricity) of jets was different between A and B (p less than 0.05), between B and D (p less than 0.01), and between C and D (p less than 0.01). The shape of jets was correlated with flow rate, continuous-wave velocity, and pressure gradient in B, C, and D but not in A. Measured pressure gradients and estimated gradients by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography were similarly correlated from A through D. 
1	Comparative ophthalmologic studies on children and adults with craniopharyngiomas. The subjects of the study are 74 patients with craniopharyngiomas treated at the Clinic of Neurosurgery, Bulgarian Medical Academy, within the period 1960-1989. Fifty of the patients are children and 24 adults. The diagnosis of all patients is made on the base of clinical, X-ray and histological studies. The ophthalmologic state was studied in all patients, prior to operation, via routine methods. Reduced visual acuity was established in 69.6% of the children and 81.8% of the adults. The presence of congestive optic papilla was diagnosed in 22% of the children and 12.5% of the adults. Optic atrophy was established in 62.5% of the adults and 52% of the children. Various defects in the visual field were established in 67.7% of the children and 81.8% of the adults with the predomination of bitemporal defects. The use of highly informative conventional and modern X-ray methods is recommended in all patients suspected of compression of the visual pathways. 
5	Strong association of HLA-DRw9 in Chinese patients with recurrent oral ulcers. The frequency of HLA-DR and -DQ antigen occurrence was investigated in 80 Chinese patients with recurrent oral ulcers and 107 matched healthy control subjects of the same ethnic group. No significant differences in the presence of HLA-DQ antigens were found. However, the HLA-DRw9 antigen occurs more frequently in patients with recurrent oral ulcers (p less than 0.0001, corrected p less than 0.005) and may be considered as a genetic marker of the disease in the Chinese population. 
3	Naloxone and spinal fluid drainage as adjuncts in the surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aneurysms. Forty-seven patients who were treated for thoracoabdominal or thoracic aneurysms over a 5 1/2-year period were analyzed for neurologic deficit risk. Patients were divided into two groups for analysis. Twenty-four patients, who were treated from January 1984 to December 1986, did not undergo spinal fluid drainage or naloxone administration (group A). Twenty-three patients, who were treated from January 1987 to August 1989, had spinal fluid drainage (group B); 12 patients in this group also received naloxone as an intravenous drip at 1 microgram/kg/hr for 48 hours after surgery. Permanent neurologic deficits occurred in seven (29%) group A patients but in only one (4%) group B patient, who did not receive naloxone (p less than 0.03). The first two group B patients to receive naloxone showed complete reversal of neurologic deficits on waking from anesthesia. This significant reduction in neurologic deficit was associated with an increased 1-year survival rate (72% in group A, 91% in group B). We conclude that the use of naloxone and spinal fluid drainage reduces the incidence of neurologic deficit that is associated with repair of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. This reduction in neurologic deficit is associated with improved survival in the long term. The observed reversal of postoperative neurologic deficits with naloxone implicates opiates as a major factor in the pathophysiology of spinal cord ischemia. 
5	Optimal escort for interhospital transport of pediatric emergencies. The charts of 130 seriously ill or injured children transported to tertiary level intensive care were examined to determine the incidence of secondary insults incurred, as a function of escort training. Of all insults incurred, approximately 8% occurred with specialized pediatric transport escorts who were accompanied by a tertiary care physician (Group III, n = 52); 20% with specialized pediatric transport escorts alone (Group II, n = 44); and 72% with escorts who had not received specialized pediatric transport training (Group I, n = 34). Based on our results, we recommend that all transport coordinators review the qualifications and experience of their transport team members and all potential escorts to assess their ability to provide optimal care for the children they transport, particularly during long journeys, transfer by air, and when serious illness or injury is involved. 
5	Inflammatory response in retrieved noncemented porous-coated implants. One hundred forty-six noncemented porous-coated hip and knee implants retrieved from 97 patients were evaluated histologically for the type, amount, and anatomic distribution of tissue ingrowth. The degree of inflammatory cell infiltrate present was also evaluated and the predominant cell type was identified. An inflammatory infiltrate was present in the components of 21 of 97 patients (22%). In 16 of the 21 cases the infiltrate was lymphocytes and histiocytes with a minor population of plasma cells. One of the remaining five cases had a predominately plasma cell reaction, and the other four had significant populations of plasma cells. Vascular proliferation was observed in nine of the 21 cases. Bone ingrowth was present in ten of the 21 cases. A 38% incidence of removal for persistent pain was present in cases with an inflammatory infiltrate. Seventeen of 87 patients (20%) with cobalt-chromium devices and four of ten patients (40%) with titanium devices were identified as having an inflammatory infiltrate. The origin of the inflammatory infiltrate is unclear. All patients with inflammatory infiltrates had noninfected implants, which were not loose roentgenographically or clinically at the time of removal. Hypersensitivity and allergic responses to metal ions may produce such infiltrates. It is impossible, however, in the present study to definitively determine the etiology of the infiltrates. 
2	Anorectal surgery in the HIV+ patient: update. Anorectal surgery in HIV+ patients historically has been viewed with a great deal of nihilism. Advances in medical therapy and better understanding of unique pathophysiologic processes have afforded the colorectal surgeon the ability to treat better and sometimes cure the anorectal complications of AIDS. We present a series of 75 consecutive surgical procedures (1-year accrual) on HIV+ (40) and CDC AIDS (22) patients. Surgical procedures, perioperative T cell counts, and outcome will be presented; 53 percent of procedures resulted in complete healing of anal wounds; 30 percent resulted in partial healing with symptomatic relief; 17 percent resulted in symptomatic relief or tissue diagnosis without appreciable wound healing. The healing rate was significantly higher in the HIV+ group (69 percent) compared to the AIDS group (26 percent). Perioperative T cell counts did not have predictive value on outcome. No patients suffered significant unexpected morbidity, mortality, or incontinence. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of several disease processes unique to HIV+ patients and data from our ongoing investigation using RNA hybridization are presented. 
4	Comparison of the antihypertensive effects of delapril and enalapril. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delapril and enalapril were compared in a double-blind, randomized, parallel study. The population included 142 patients with essential hypertension who were treated with delapril and 140 treated with enalapril. At the end of a 2 week initial placebo period, the diastolic blood pressure of these patients ranged from 95 to 115 mm Hg in the sitting position. After this placebo period, randomization took place. Patients in the delapril group received 15 mg of the drug twice daily. Treatment with enalapril was started with a daily dose of 10 mg. If the diastolic blood pressure did not fall to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or at least by 15 mm Hg after 2 weeks of treatment, the doses of the ACE inhibitors were doubled. After another 2 weeks, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily was added if the target level of diastolic blood pressure was not reached. Both drugs caused a similar decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of both ACE inhibitors was increased by the addition of the diuretic. The frequency and severity of side effects were similar in the two groups of patients. It is concluded from this study that delapril and enalapril do not differ in antihypertensive efficacy nor in safety. 
1	Recreational sun exposure in Puerto Rico: trends and cancer risk awareness. Persons who sunbathe or engage in other activities at the beach are exposed to large amounts of UV radiation. Four hundred seven adults who visited the beaches of Puerto Rico were surveyed to determine their knowledge about the risks of sun exposure and to evaluate sunscreen use. The group consisted of 195 year-round Puerto Rican residents and 212 tourists. Ninety-five percent believed that the sun can cause skin cancer, although only half of the subset who lived all year in Puerto Rico believed that they personally received enough exposure to be at risk. The majority of the group (83%) understood the meaning of the sun protection factor numbers, although 35% used either nothing or a nonscreening oil. Half of Puerto Rican residents rarely or never used sunscreen protection while sunbathing. When sunscreen was used, the most important factor sought was given as sun protection factor (64%), followed by a perceived ability to aid in tanning (26%). 
1	An analysis of the results of mammographically guided biopsies of the breast. Three hundred and fifty-three women underwent 358 biopsies of the breast for nonpalpable mammographic lesions during a five year period. Cancer was identified in 95 (27 per cent). Mammographic findings in the patients with cancer were calcifications only (54 per cent), a mass (27 per cent), a mass with calcifications (15 per cent), an asymmetric distortion (1 per cent) and an asymmetric distortion with calcifications (3 per cent). Cancer was identified in 29 per cent of the biopsies done for calcifications, 20 per cent of those done for a mass with calcifications, 6 per cent of those done for an asymmetric distortion and 38 per cent of those done for an asymmetric distortion with calcifications. Forty-nine per cent of the mammographically suspicious calcifications were cancer, while 100 per cent of the indeterminate calcifications were benign. Forty-five per cent of the spiculated masses were cancerous, while only 3 per cent of the circumscribed masses were malignant. For those patients with carcinoma undergoing axillary lymph node dissection, 13 per cent had one or more positive nodes. A strategy for increasing the effectiveness of mammographically guided biopsies of the breast is presented. 
3	Capsular genu syndrome. We report 5 patients with unilateral infarct and 1 with hemorrhage limited to the genu of the internal capsule. The most prominent finding was contralateral facial and lingual hemiparesis with dysarthria. Three patients also showed unilateral mastication-palatal-pharyngeal weakness, and 1 had unilateral vocal cord paresis. Mild limb involvement was limited to hand weakness in 4 patients. Our findings suggest that the majority of motor corticopontine and corticocobulbar fibers are located in the genu of the internal capsule. The faciolingual syndrome and its variants are highly suggestive of capsular genu stroke. 
3	mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression: a novel genetic abnormality in mitochondrial diseases. We studied two related infants with a fatal mitochondrial disease, affecting muscle in one and liver in the other. Quantitative analysis revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA in affected tissues. This genetic abnormality was also observed in muscle of an unrelated infant with myopathy and in muscle and kidney of a fourth child with myopathy and nephropathy. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the depletion of mtDNA in muscle fibers was correlated with a respiratory chain defect and with lack of mitochondrially translated proteins. Although the differential tissue involvement in these infants suggests mtDNA heteroplasmy, sequence analysis of mtDNA replication origins did not reveal any abnormality that could account for the low copy number. 
2	Ondansetron: a new entity in emesis control. Nausea and vomiting are serious problems for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Dopamine receptor and cholinergic receptor antagonism have been the target mechanism for agents used to combat drug-induced nausea and vomiting; more recently, blockade of serotonin receptors has been used for this indication. Current therapies are limited by extrapyramidal adverse effects, as well as drowsiness, sedation, respiratory depression, and cardiac effects. Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic. 
4	Stroke volume during submaximal exercise in endurance-trained normotensive subjects and in untrained hypertensive subjects with beta blockade (propranolol and pindolol). The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stroke volume (SV) at increasing submaximal exercise intensities was studied in 12 endurance-trained normotensive and 12 untrained hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) men, aged 18 to 34 years. Subjects were assigned to each of 3 treatments in a double-blind, randomized order: placebo, propranolol (80 mg twice daily) and pindolol (10 mg twice daily) for 10 days, with a period of 48 to 60 hours from the initial dose to the first treadmill test and a 4-day washout period between drugs. Cardiac output was measured using the carbon dioxide rebreathing method and SV was calculated from cardiac output and heart rate as follows: SV = cardiac output/heart rate. Cardiac outputs were estimated at rest and while walking on a treadmill at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of the subject's previously determined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). No significant differences were found in cardiac output between either of the drugs and placebo at rest, or at any of the 4 rates of work. Propranolol significantly increased SV above placebo values (p less than 0.05) for both trained and untrained groups at the intensities of 45, 60 and 75%. Significant differences in SV were found between pindolol and placebo only at the intensities of 60 and 75% in the trained group. Contrary to expectations, SV showed no indication of a plateau with propranolol in the trained subjects throughout the 4 different exercise intensities, whereas a plateau was established under placebo conditions by 45% of VO2max in both trained and untrained subjects. These results suggest that both trained and untrained hypertensive persons can exercise with beta-adrenergic blockade at submaximal levels without compromised cardiac function. 
4	Chylous ascites should suggest constrictive pericarditis even in a patient with cirrhosis. Chylous ascites, a milky, high triglyceride fluid is usually found in patients with lymphatic obstruction from malignancy. We describe a patient with cirrhosis who developed constrictive pericarditis and chylous ascites. Long-standing portal hypertension compounded by elevated central venous pressure provided several pathophysiologic contributions to the formation of the chylous ascites. Chylous ascites even in a cirrhotic requires prompt assessment for conditions leading to elevated central venous pressure. 
2	"Spontaneous sump syndrome": Successful treatment by duodenoscopic sphincterotomy. "Sump syndrome" is a rare complication of side-to-side choledochoenterostomy operations which develops in the distal, nonfunctioning limb of the common bile duct where lithogenic bile, gastrointestinal contents, and debris accumulate. We report here a patient who developed spontaneous sump syndrome as a result of the formation of choledochoduodenal fistula, and who presented with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses. The patient's symptoms and liver abscesses resolved completely after treatment by endoscopic sphincterotomy and antibiotics. This case demonstrates that sump syndrome may occur spontaneously, that it can be a cause for pyogenic liver abscess formation, and that it may be treated effectively by endoscopic sphincterotomy. 
5	Acute respiratory failure and pulmonary thrombosis in leukemic children. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) in an 11-year-old child with pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the beginning of induction therapy was observed, connected with a pulmonary thrombosis and not with an infective origin. A systematic search for this pathology identified six other children with the same pulmonary complication, five of whom where in the early phase of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and one in induction therapy for ALL in marrow relapse. At the beginning of the symptomatology, all children presented severe hypoxia and hypercapnia, with no or minimal chest radiograph abnormalities and no clear hemodynamic involvement. In all patients the arteriography and nuclear imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis. The causes of the thrombi could be connected with neoplastic emboli after cell lysis and/or with the vascular damage resulting from antiblastic therapy. Intravenous urokinase treatment and respiratory assistance had been successfully carried out in six of seven children. 
5	Can concomitant restriction be detected in adult men with airflow obstruction? A reduction in lung volume is used to diagnose physiologic restriction in the pulmonary function tests of patients with lung disease. Airflow obstruction is commonly associated with hyperinflation of static lung volume. Because restriction and obstruction exert opposite effects on lung volumes, we questioned whether the lack of hyperinflation of static lung volumes could indicate the presence of concomitant restriction in patients with airflow obstructive ventilatory defects. To assess this, we evaluated by pulmonary function tests and chest roentgenograms of 58 patients with airflow obstruction (group 1), 18 of whom then sustained various types of resection for lung cancer (group 2) as a type of superimposed restriction. We selected 80 percent of predicted as the lower limit of "normal" frequently used by clinical pulmonary function laboratories. Despite a statistically significant decrease in total lung capacity (p less than 0.05) for the postpneumonectomy patients, when the static lung volume measurements of the patients with resection were evaluated, no one lung volume showed a consistent reduction sufficient to detect the superimposed restriction in all these patients. Using 80 percent of predicted as "normal," 61 percent of our patients with airflow obstruction and superimposed restriction would have been missed. We conclude that it is clinically difficult, based on only static lung volume measurements alone, to detect restriction superimposed on the hyperinflation of airflow obstruction unless these lung volumes are reduced to below accepted "normal" limits. 
4	Interatrial shunt flow profiles in newborn infants: a colour flow and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic study. Interatrial shunt flow profiles in 36 normal term infants were examined serially by colour flow and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic techniques from within an hour of birth to four or five days after birth. Shunt flow across the foramen ovale was detected in 33 normal infants (92%) within an hour of birth (mean 40 minutes). The occurrence of interatrial shunting decreased with age, but a shunt signal was still detected in 17 infants (47%) on the fourth or fifth day of life, by then the ductus arteriosus had already closed in all the normal infants. The direction of interatrial shunt flow was predominantly left-to-right, but in 64% there was a coexistent small right-to-left shunt in diastole within an hour of birth; by four to five days it was found in 19%. In the six patients with persistent fetal circulation the direction of the interatrial shunt flow was predominantly right-to-left with biphasic peaks in diastole and systole at the early stage of the disease, and the period of right-to-left shunt flow during each cardiac cycle was significantly longer than that in normal infants examined within 1 hour of birth. In all patients the ductus closed before the foramen ovale. At the time of ductal closure in all patients with persistent fetal circulation right-to-left shunt flow was seen during diastole and its period was still prolonged. These findings suggest that interatrial shunting, predominantly left-to-right, is common in normal newborn infants. 
5	Adrenal insufficiency in the cancer patient: implications for the surgeon. Aspects of acute and chronic adrenal insufficiency of interest to surgeons who treat cancer patients are reviewed. Clinical features and the management of both primary and secondary types are considered with reference to classification, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically considered are the management of patients with Addison's disease and metastases. Prompt recognition and treatment of adrenal insufficiency can avert potentially life-threatening situations. 
5	Verbal memory impairment correlates with hippocampal pyramidal cell density. Thirty-five patients with medically refractory epilepsy localized to the temporal lobe (18 left, 17 right) completed the verbal Selective Reminding Test before surgery. Verbal memory impairments existed before surgery regardless of the lateralization of the seizure focus, but patients with left temporal seizure foci were significantly more impaired. After surgical removal of the mesial temporal lobe structures, 2 blinded observers established volumetric cell densities for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule cell layer of the area dentata. Statistically significant correlations existed between presurgical memory impairment and cell counts (in CA3 and the hilar area, only) for patients with left temporal seizure foci. These findings support the hippocampal model of memory and complement prior research documenting the memory impairments present after surgical removal of the mesial temporal structures. 
5	Electrical pacing for dynamic treatment of unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Experiment in long-denervated muscle. In order to explore the possibility of clinical application of laryngeal pacing as a treatment for unilateral vocal cord paralysis, we examined the reactivity of atrophic muscle to electrical stimulation in dogs whose recurrent laryngeal nerves were damaged by crushing, dissection followed by resuturing, or a 3-cm neurectomy. The threshold level to induce enough vocal cord adduction reached the maximum at 2 weeks after nerve injury, decreased with time, and never surpassed 7 V in each case. On the basis of results of these preliminary probings, laryngeal pacing was conducted on a dog 15 months after resection of the laryngeal nerve. Adduction of the paralyzed vocal cord for synchrony with the intact cord was achieved by 7 V of electrical stimulation of the thyroarytenoid muscle that was triggered by signals from the cricothyroid muscle. 
2	Surgical correction of hydrothorax from diaphragmatic eventration in children on peritoneal dialysis. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is frequently used in the pediatric age group for reversible and end-stage renal failure. Most pediatric patients tolerate this therapy with few complications. Approximately 2% of children, however, develop massive unilateral hydrothorax. This major complication usually results in the discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in all forms and the institution of hemodialysis. Occult diaphragmatic defects account for most adult and pediatric patients who develop this complication. Three pediatric patients receiving CAPD complicated by massive hydrothorax are described. All patients were successfully treated by thoracotomy and repair of the diaphragmatic eventration with an immediate return to CAPD. This is the first report of successful therapy of this kind in children. A review of the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of massive hydrothorax developing during CAPD therapy is presented. 
1	Lack of late skin necrosis in man after high-dose irradiation using small field sizes: experiences of grid therapy. Out of a total of 437 patients with superior vena caval syndrome or advanced malignancy, given single-dose grid radiotherapy, four survived to 7 years. The dose to the skin under each of the 77 holes in the grid was approximately 58 Gy. The lack of skin necrosis in the total of 308 skin circles of 1 cm diameter among these survivors, compared with known necrosis rates in larger irradiated areas, implies that there is a marked field-size effect for late necrosis in small areas of irradiated skin. 
4	Coronary angioplasty after coronary bypass surgery: initial results and late outcome in 422 patients. From 1978 to 1988, coronary angioplasty was performed in 422 patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery (264 patients with native coronary artery angioplasty and 158 patients with graft angioplasty). Angioplasty was successful in 84%, unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 11% and complicated by one or more major cardiac events in 5% (myocardial infarction 5%, emergency bypass surgery 2% and death 0.2%). Follow-up data were obtained in 99% of 356 patients with successful angioplasty. At a mean of 33 +/- 26 months, 92% were alive, 73% had improvement in angina and 61% were free of angina. One or more of the following late events occurred in 67 patients (19%): myocardial infarction (6%), elective reoperation (13%) and cardiac death (6%). Repeat angioplasty was performed in 27%, with a success rate of 89% and no deaths. Initial success rates were equal in native vessel versus graft angioplasty, but late outcome was less favorable with the latter because of a higher rate of infarction (11% versus 4%, p less than 0.05) and need for reoperation (19% versus 10%, p less than 0.05). The initial success rate was higher in vein grafts less than 1 year old compared with grafts 1 to 4 years or greater than 4 years after operation (92% versus 85% versus 83%, respectively) and adverse late events were less frequent after angioplasty in recent vein grafts (less than 1 year 13%, 1 to 4 years 35%, greater than 4 years 29%; less than 1 versus greater than 1 year, p less than 0.05). 
3	Distribution of three alpha-chain beta-hexosaminidase A mutations among Tay-Sachs carriers. DNA from 176 carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene was tested for the presence of the three mutations most commonly found among Ashkenazi Jews: the so-called insertion, splice junction, and adult mutations. Among 148 Ashkenazi Jews tested, 108 had the insertion mutation, 26 had the splice junction mutation, five had the adult mutation, and nine had none of the three. Among 28 non-Jewish carriers tested, most of whom were obligate carriers, four had the insertion mutation, one had the adult mutation, and the remaining 23 had none of the three. 
5	Role of membrane proteins in monosodium urate crystal-membrane interactions. II. Effect of pretreatments of erythrocyte membranes with membrane permeable and impermeable protein crosslinking agents. Intact, human erythrocytes were pretreated with membrane permeable, dimethyl adipimidate (DMA) and dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and membrane impermeable 3,3' dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) protein crosslinking agents and incubated with monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals. The percent inhibition of lysis values for pretreated cells relative to untreated cells were determined. All 3 agents caused a concentration dependent inhibition of MSUM induced hemolysis that was not due to a decrease in MSUM binding to the pretreated membranes. It was proposed that the inhibition of lysis was due to crosslinking of integral and cytoskeletal membrane proteins, resulting in a reduced mobility of the proteins, inhibition of lateralization of integral proteins into aggregates and decreased "pore" formation in the membrane. 
5	Otogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum meningitis. A case of meningitis secondary to acute suppurative otitis media in a previously healthy child is reported. The only organism isolated from blood after aerobic and prolonged anaerobic culture was identified as Fusobacterium necrophorum. Complete recovery followed treatment with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy. The role of anaerobes in the development of meningitis, the isolation and identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum, the clinical presentations of F. necrophorum infection and the choice of antibiotics in the treatment of these infections are discussed. 
4	Prevalence and association of asteroid hyalosis with systemic diseases. We performed a cross-sectional study of 12,205 patients, which identified 101 patients (0.83%) with asteroid hyalosis. These patients were examined for associated systemic and ocular conditions. Diabetes mellitus was found in 29 of the patients with asteroid hyalosis (29%), as compared to ten of 101 (10%) control subjects (P = .0007). An increased prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (61 of 101 [60%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 29 of 101 [29%] control subjects; P = .0001) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (30 of 101 [30%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 13 of 101 [13%] control subjects; P = .006) was also discovered in the asteroid hyalosis group. Additionally, patients with asteroid hyalosis were found to be more hyperopic than control subjects (P = .009). 
4	Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy. We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression. Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2). Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes. 
5	Leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade do not inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in sheep. Several lines of evidence suggest that leukotrienes may be mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, the effect of leukotriene inhibition on HPV remains controversial. The present study investigated the effect of leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade on HPV in the halothane-anesthetized sheep. After initial baseline measurements, the pulmonary pressor response to 15 min of global hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.13) was measured. A second set of baseline measurements was obtained and the sheep then received the combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor BW755C, the selective lipoxygenase inhibitor U60257, or the leukotriene receptor antagonist LY171883. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained after drug administration and during a subsequent hypoxic challenge (FIO2 = 0.13). Initial hypoxic challenge increased pulmonary artery pressure 68% and increased pulmonary vascular resistance 104%. Pulmonary hemodynamics after recovery from hypoxia were similar to initial baseline values. Drug administration had no significant hemodynamic effect. Hypoxic challenge after drug administration resulted in a pulmonary pressor response identical to the initial hypoxic challenge. Because leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade did not alter the response to hypoxia, we conclude that leukotrienes are not obligatory mediators of HPV. A critical review of the literature supports a modulatory rather than an obligatory role for leukotrienes in HPV. 
3	Duplex scanning of normal or minimally diseased carotid arteries: correlation with arteriography and clinical outcome. This study evaluated the role of duplex scanning in the management of patients with normal or minimally diseases carotid arteries. Carotid duplex scans were interpreted according to previously established criteria and considered normal when pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms showed laminar flow or only minor flow disturbances. Normal flow patterns were noted by duplex scanning in 100 carotid bifurcations of 72 patients who also underwent carotid arteriography. Neurologic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke) were present in relation to 23 arteries and absent in relation to 77 arteries. On the 23 symptomatic sides arteriography was interpreted as normal in eight, 1% to 15% stenosis in 14, and 16% to 40% stenosis in one. For the 77 asymptomatic sides, arteriography showed normal vessels in 15, 1% to 15% stenosis in 43, and 16% to 40% stenosis in 19. One symptomatic patient was treated by carotid endarterectomy for an irregular 1% to 15% stenosis. None of the asymptomatic lesions were in the range of 80% to 99% stenosis, which would justify endarterectomy for asymptomatic disease. Clinical follow-up for a mean interval of 28 months on 20 of the 22 symptomatic patients not undergoing surgery revealed no strokes and transient recurrent symptoms in two patients. Assuming that the single operation in this study was indicated, duplex scanning correctly identified lesions not requiring carotid endarterectomy in 96% (22/23) of the symptomatic patients. A normal duplex scan also predicted a benign clinical outcome without operation. Duplex scanning can reliably exclude surgically treatable carotid bifurcation lesions in asymptomatic patients, and endarterectomy is rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with normal duplex scan results. This study supports a nonoperative therapeutic approach for most patients with neurologic symptoms and a normal carotid duplex scan on the appropriate side. 
1	Clinicopathological features of elevated lesions of the duodenal bulb. We present here our findings on patients with an elevated lesion of the duodenal bulb. All these patients were treated in our clinics between the years 1984 and 1988. These lesions were present in 36 of 8,802 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal pan-endoscopy. Two patients had a duodenal carcinoma, 2 an adenoma, and 1 a Brunner's gland adenoma. There were 15 with a hyperplastic polyp, 3 with a heterogenic gastric mucosa, 3 with Brunner's gland hyperplasia, 6 with duodenitis, and 4 with regenerative mucosa. Among these 36 lesions, only 69% (25 lesions) were evident on the upper gastrointestinal X-ray series. Adenoma and Brunner's gland adenoma were of a pedunculated form of the gross type and had an irregular surface mucosa. Both duodenal carcinomas were detected by endoscopic biopsy and were resected. Histologically, these lesions were limited to the submucosal layer and were of the non-pedunculated polypoid form, but there were no other characteristic endoscopic features, in comparison with other elevated lesions. Thus, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with routine observations of the duodenal bulb plus endoscopic biopsy will lead to a definite diagnosis of these elevated lesions and to the early detection and treatment of this rare malignant lesion. 
1	Rhabdomyosarcomas in the head and neck: MR imaging evaluation. To determine the typical magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity characteristics of rhabdomyosarcomas, short repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) (T1-weighted) and long TR (proton density and T2-weighted) images of 13 patients with rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck were retrospectively reviewed. Seven patients received gadopentetate dimeglumine injections. The most common MR appearance was that of a homogeneous mass, hyperintense to both muscle and fat on long TR/long TE images and isointense or minimally hyperintense to muscle on short TR/short TE images. All lesions of the patients who received gadopentetate dimeglumine enhanced markedly. Two lesions had intratumoral hemorrhage, and six were markedly heterogeneous in signal intensity. Similar MR signal intensity patterns have been described for lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The forte of MR imaging lies in its ability to delineate precisely the extent of the rhabdomyosarcoma. 
4	The prophylactic use of octreotide in a patient with ovarian carcinoid and valvular heart disease. This case report describes the use of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, in the management of a patient with an ovarian carcinoid tumour and severe cardiac valvular disease. This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium. However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. 
4	Long-term clinical results with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft. From 1977 to 1987, 829 Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) were implanted in 766 patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. There were 476 patients who had aortic valve replacement, 234 who had mitral valve replacement, and 44 who had double valve replacement. The standard-profile design was used in 508 patients and the low-profile design in 321 patients. Follow-up was obtained for 97% of patients, with calculation of event-free probabilities. At 10 years the overall probability of freedom from structural failure was 48% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 44% +/- 15% after mitral valve replacement, and 79% +/- 11% after double valve replacement. Although at 5 years the probability of failure was statistically lower with the low-profile design, this favorability was lost by 6 years. Freedom from structural failure was only 47% +/- 7% for the standard-profile valve at 10 years. Thus the probability of freedom from reoperation was only 46% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 39% +/- 6% after mitral valve replacement, and 65% +/- 20% after double valve replacement at 10 years. Thromboembolism occurred in 69 patients, for a predicted freedom from this complication at 10 years of 79% +/- 3% after aortic, 73% +/- 7% after mitral, and 96% +/- 4% after double valve replacement. There were 31 cases of endocarditis. The 10-year predicted freedom from endocarditis, therefore, was 86% +/- 3% after aortic, 98% +/- 1% after mitral, and 97% +/- 1% after double valve replacement. A total of 221 operative and late deaths were recorded in this series. Prosthetic valve failure accounted for 27% of late deaths. The 10-year survival rates were estimated to be 56% +/- 5% (aortic valve replacement), 54% +/- 6% (mitral valve replacement), and 51% +/- 8% (double valve replacement). We concluded that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft provides less than optimal clinical performance and its use has been discontinued. 
5	Itraconazole in opportunistic mycoses: cryptococcosis and aspergillosis. Striking results were obtained with oral itraconazole therapy in two opportunistic mycoses. Of 28 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 18 achieved complete responses, including 16 of 24 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Other manifestations of cryptococcosis were similarly responsive. In aspergillosis 12 of 15 patients responded, including 8 of 10 immunocompromised hosts. These patients included those with invasive pulmonary disease (4/5), skeletal disease (2/2), pleural disease (1/2), and pericardial, sinus, mastoid, hepatosplenic, or nail disease (1/1). These results with itraconazole compare favorably to conventional (parenteral) therapy, and toxicity was minimal. This suggests that comparative trials are now in order. 
1	Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in a polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. A polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma with tyrosine-rich crystalloid deposits is reported. The literature is reviewed, and diagnostic and histogenetic implications of this finding are discussed. 
3	Streptococcus bovis meningitis: report of 2 cases. We describe 2 cases of Streptococcus bovis meningitis and review the 9 cases previously reported. This microorganism is a rare cause of meningitis in which there are no distinctive clinical or laboratory features. The Gram stain of the CSF is usually negative. Ten of the 11 cases had some underlying disease or comorbid condition that predisposed to S bovis infection: gastrointestinal disorder, endocarditis, CSF leak, polymyalgia rheumatica, and mandibular block. Treatment with high-dose penicillin is usually adequate. 
1	Third ventricle cavernous angioma: report of two cases. Cavernous angioma arising in the third ventricle is an extremely rare disease. We have reviewed five cases previously reported, as well as our own two cases, and discuss the clinical characteristics of and surgical approach to cavernous angioma at this site. The bifrontal craniotomy and interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach minimize the damage to the brain and allow for an approach to the third ventricle in a wide operative field with minimal compression of the brain itself. We have found this approach to be suitable for surgery on angiomas of the anterior half of the third ventricle. 
5	Partial characterization of Chlamydia trachomatis isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics. In vitro susceptibility testing was done on urogenital isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis from five patients, four of whom were suspected treatment failures. At least one isolate from each patient was resistant to tetracycline at concentrations greater than or equal to micrograms/ml, although less than 1% of a population of organisms showed high-level resistance. Fully resistant populations selected by passage through 8 micrograms/ml tetracycline either died or lost their resistance on further passage in antibiotic-free medium. Relatively large inocula were required to demonstrate resistance, and morphology of inclusions was altered at high tetracycline concentrations. The observed resistance may be a new characteristic of the organism or merely newly recognized. Isolates resistant to tetracycline were resistant to doxycycline, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin but sensitive to rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Thus, resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin occurs in C. trachomatis and may be a factor in some treatment failures. 
4	Two types of abnormal genes for plasminogen in families with a predisposition for thrombosis [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Apr 1;88(7):2967] The gene coding for plasminogen has been compared with several abnormal genes from Japanese patients by the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis. Two types of abnormal genes coding for plasminogen were identified in these patients. In the type I mutation, a guanosine in GCT coding for Ala-601 near the active-site histidine was replaced by an adenosine resulting in ACT coding for threonine. This mutation was also shown by the loss of a cleavage site for Fnu4HI endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GCTGC but not ACTGC. In the type II mutation, a guanosine in GTC coding for Val-355 was replaced by a thymidine resulting in TTC coding for phenylalanine. This change was readily shown by digestion with Ava II endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GGTCC and not GTTCC. The type I mutation has been found to be identical to a plasminogen variant identified in Japanese patients by amino acid sequence analysis and also detected by isoelectric focusing, whereas the type II mutation is a unique amino acid substitution in the connecting region between the third and fourth kringles in plasminogen. DNA sequence analysis also revealed that the abnormal genes carry several silent nucleotide substitutions located primarily within introns and 5' and 3' flanking regions. 
5	Biobehavioral factors in Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Review and examination. The behavioral studies component of the multicenter Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) was designed to examine the relation of biobehavioral factors and frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy, and disease end points in a study population that had experienced recent myocardial infarction and significant ventricular ectopy. Biobehavioral factors included both psychosocial (depression, anxiety, social support, type A behavior, mood, defensiveness, and anger expressiveness) and psychophysiological (heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to a videogame stressor) variables. Data were collected at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Of the 502 patients enrolled in CAPS, 353 participated in the behavioral studies component. At baseline, assessments of psychosocial variables revealed the CAPS study population to be generally similar to other heart disease populations, and no relation between these variables and psychophysiological reactivity or arrhythmias was found. At follow-up among patients assigned to the placebo condition, biobehavioral variables were not related to levels of VPCs or VPC suppression. Cox regression analyses revealed that type B behavior, depression, and reduced heart rate reactivity were associated with increased clinical events, even after controlling for baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, use of beta-blockers, use of digitalis, Q wave of qualifying myocardial infarction, and presence of unsustained ventricular tachycardia on baseline electrocardiogram. It is hypothesized that the relation among reduced heart rate reactivity, depression, and clinical events is mediated by diminished cardiac vagal tone. 
4	Increased rat cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme activity and mRNA expression in pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy. Effects on coronary resistance, contractility, and relaxation. We compared the activity and physiologic effects of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) using isovolumic hearts from male Wistar rats with left ventricular hypertrophy due to chronic experimental aortic stenosis and from control rats. In response to the infusion of 3.5 X 10(-8) M angiotensin I in the isolated buffer perfused beating hearts, the intracardiac fractional conversion to angiotensin II was higher in the hypertrophied hearts compared with the controls (17.3 +/- 4.1% vs 6.8 +/- 1.3%, P less than 0.01). ACE activity was also significantly increased in the free wall, septum, and apex of the hypertrophied left ventricle, whereas ACE activity from the nonhypertrophied right ventricle of the aortic stenosis rats was not different from that of the control rats. Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ purified RNA demonstrated the expression of ACE mRNA, which was increased fourfold in left ventricular tissue obtained from the hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy compared with the controls. In both groups, the intracardiac conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II caused a comparable dose-dependent increase in coronary resistance. In the control hearts, angiotensin II activation had no significant effect on systolic or diastolic function; however, it was associated with a dose-dependent depression of left ventricular diastolic relaxation in the hypertrophied hearts. These novel observations suggest that cardiac ACE is induced in hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy, and that the resultant intracardiac activation of angiotensin II may have differential effects on myocardial relaxation in hypertrophied hearts relative to controls. 
2	Gracilis muscle transposition for faecal incontinence. Transposition of the gracilis muscle for faecal incontinence was performed in 13 patients. Six gained satisfactory continence, four were improved, two did not benefit from the operation and one patient died from intercurrent disease before closure of a pre-existing colostomy. Anal manometry compared with a control group showed no alteration in resting and pressure at a median of 35 mmHg (range 5-63 mmHg), whereas maximum squeeze pressure increased from a median of 38 mmHg (range 5-79 mmHg) to 59 mmHg (range 10-143 mmHg) (P = 0.041) which was, however, significantly lower than 130 mmHg (range 81-236 mmHg) in the control group. All patients who benefited from the operation had an increase in maximum squeeze pressure. The ability to retain a viscous fluid in the rectum was measured in seven patients, four of whom had gained satisfactory continence and three of whom had improved continence. They were able to retain a median volume of 200 ml (range 50-225 ml) without leakage compared with 325 ml (range 250-400 ml) in the control group. These patients could retain the maximum amount of viscous fluid for 5-8 min, whereas all control subjects could do so for more than 15 min. It is concluded that, although gracilis transposition never results in normal continence, acceptable continence may be achieved in selected patients provided careful attention is paid to the technical details of the procedure and provided that systematic postoperative exercises are performed. 
4	Lateral medullary infarction: prognosis in an unselected series. We describe the acute and long-term prognosis in 43 patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) collected from a population-based stroke registry from 1982 to July 1988. Mean age was 63.9 years and median time of follow-up was 33 months. In the acute phase, 5 patients (11.6%) died from respiratory and cardiovascular complications and 2 new strokes occurred, both in the posterior circulation. During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up. 
4	Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review. The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years. Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy. Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time. 
5	The osteogenetic potential of fracture haematoma. Subperiosteal and intramuscular transplantation of the haematoma. We studied the precise role of the fracture haematoma in healing by the experimental transplantation of the haematoma at two days and four days after fracture of the rat femur to subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. We used bone marrow and peripheral blood haematomas for control experiments. The transplanted two-day fracture haematoma produced new bone by endochondral ossification at the subperiosteal site, but not at the intramuscular site. Four-day fracture haematoma produced new bone formation at both subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. These results suggest that fracture haematoma has an inherent osteogenetic potential. 
5	Proliferation characteristics of human colorectal carcinomas measured in vivo. The cell proliferation kinetics of 100 human colonic and rectal adenocarcinomas have been studied in vivo by bromodeoxyuridine infusion and multiparameter flow cytometry. A total of 97 patients, three with synchronous tumours, consented to receive a single bolus dose of 250 mg between 2.4 and 16 h before curative or palliative surgery. By this method, the ploidy pattern, the total and aneuploid labelling indices (LI), the S phase duration (Ts) and the potential doubling time (Tpot) can be estimated. Of the tumours 48 were diploid and 52 were aneuploid. The mean and median total LI of 100 tumours were 9.0 per cent (range 0.7-22.2 per cent). The mean aneuploid LI was 12.1 per cent (median 12.0 per cent, range 2.0-25.5 per cent), and was significantly higher than the total LI (P = 0.01). The labelling index alone is not a sufficient indicator of proliferation, because the Ts also varies within and between tumours. The intertumour range of the Ts varied from 4.0 to 28.6 h. The mean was 14.1 h and the median was 13.1 h. The mean Tpot was 5.9 days (median 3.9 days) with a range of 1.7-21.4 days. No correlation was found between any kinetic parameters and the Dukes' classification or histological classification. The correlation between proliferation and prognosis will be established in due course. 
1	The cancer experience in the Framingham Heart Study cohort. The almost 40-year records of The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort were reviewed to establish the cancer experience of this noninstitutionalized group of white subjects. Diagnoses were confirmed from pathology and laboratory reports and clinical notes. Age-specific incidence rates were compared with Connecticut Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Among the 5209 subjects, 1201 malignancies were confirmed. Median age at diagnosis was 69 for men and 65 for women. Lung, prostate, skin, and colon accounted for more than half of men's cancers; breast, colon, and skin made up half of the women's. FHS and Connecticut SEER rates matched closely, with the same primary tumor sites appearing commonly in both groups. Thus, the FHS cohort should provide a fair database for analysis of risk factors in cancer incidence, as it has done in cardiovascular diseases. 
3	Hemorrhagic pituitary adenomas: clinicopathological features and surgical treatment. Forty-five (9.9%) of 453 pituitary adenomas operated on between January 1973 and November 1988 demonstrated hemorrhagic changes at surgery: 24 had a blood collection, 12 had a blood collection associated with hemorrhagic necrosis, and 9 had hemorrhagic necrosis. Thirteen patients (28.9%) experienced the acute symptoms of pituitary apoplexy, whereas another 32 had an "asymptomatic" hemorrhage, that is, the clinical course was comparable to an uncomplicated adenoma. Nineteen tumors (42.2%) showed marked suprasellar extension, 8 (17.8%) showed moderate extension, and 11 (24.5%) showed slight extension; another 2 (4.4%) were laterosellar and 5 (11.1%) were intrasellar. Invasive behavior was present in 32 cases (71.1%) and this may suggest another hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of tumoral hemorrhage. The incidence of hemorrhagic complications in invasive adenomas with marked suprasellar extension was particularly impressive; therefore, we do not suggest preoperative bromocriptine treatment in this type of tumor. Two of 14 patients operated on by the transcranial route died after surgery, whereas there was no operative mortality in the 31 patients operated on by the transsphenoidal route. It proved advantageous to operate as early as possible, even during the acute phase of pituitary apoplexy. The transsphenoidal approach gave the best results, but to achieve satisfactory late results multidisciplinary treatment was necessary, namely, postoperative radiotherapy in 23 patients, bromocriptine in 12, and endocrine replacement therapy in almost all. In an average follow-up period of 6.2 years, 5 (11.1%) symptomatic recurrences were observed. 
1	Giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The term mesenchymoma refers to a group of mixed tumors that are composed of two or more mesenchymal elements, excluding fibrous tissue, not ordinarily found together within the same tumor. Mesenchymomas occur most commonly in the renal and perirenal regions with rare occurrence in the breast. We describe what to our knowledge is the first report of a giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The clinical presentation, course, and treatment of a patient with this condition is discussed. Clinicians should be aware that benign mesenchymomas may involve the breast and simulate a malignant breast neoplasm. 
4	Pheochromocytoma in the pediatric age group: the prostate--an unusual location. Pheochromocytomas of the prostate are rare, with only 3 cases in adults reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a pheochromocytoma of the prostate and a second tumor in the region of the left internal iliac artery. 
5	Mechanical myocardial actuation during ventricular fibrillation improves tolerance to ischemia compared with cardiopulmonary bypass. Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a unique non-blood-contacting biventricular assist device that provides circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation without demonstrating adverse effects on the myocardium. The purpose of this study was to assess the preservation of myocardial energy stores and myocardial responses to ischemia after circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation with direct mechanical ventricular actuation versus cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty adult mongrel dogs were randomized to receive circulatory support with either cardiopulmonary bypass or direct mechanical ventricular actuation. After 4 hours of ventricular fibrillation, hearts were defibrillated and left ventricular transmural biopsies were obtained. Hearts were then excised and subjected to 90 minutes of normothermic total ischemia. Serial biopsies were obtained at 15-minute intervals to determine regional depletion of high energy phosphates. The time-to-peak ischemic contracture was recorded by using needle-tipped Millar catheters placed in the left ventricular endocardium, epicardium, septum, and right ventricle. Time-to-peak ischemic contracture of the endocardium (62.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 58.8 +/- 1.0 minutes, p less than 0.05) and septum (61.1 +/- 6.9 vs. 46.9 +/- 6.2 minutes, p less than 0.004) were significantly prolonged after direct mechanical ventricular actuation versus cardiopulmonary bypass, respectively. Similar trends were noted in the epicardium and right ventricular regions; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Left ventricular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were better preserved after direct mechanical ventricular actuation (22 +/- 1.5 mumols/g dry wt) compared with cardiopulmonary bypass (17 +/- 1.9 mumols/g dry wt). The depletion of left ventricular endocardium ATP during normothermic ischemia was significantly delayed after direct mechanical ventricular actuation compared with cardiopulmonary bypass. 
2	The symptom sensitivity index: a valuable additional parameter in 24-hour esophageal pH recording. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring is useful for the quantitative measurement of gastroesophageal reflux and for the demonstration of a temporal relationship between symptoms and reflux. The symptom index, a numerical score, was developed to quantify the association between symptoms and reflux. Because the symptom index primarily assesses the specificity of a patient's reflux symptoms, we propose to refer to this score as the symptom specificity index. Because of certain limitations of this score, we developed and evaluated a new score, the symptom sensitivity index, that quantifies the subject's sensitivity for reflux. Fifty-two consecutive patients, referred to our laboratory for ambulatory 24-h pH recording were studied. Beside the conventional reflux variables, both indexes were calculated. Although a statistically significant correlation between the indexes was found, discordance between the specificity and sensitivity indexes was seen in 17 patients (33%). Based on the findings in this study we advocate that the symptom sensitivity index should be used, in addition to the symptom specificity index, and incorporated in future pH studies to optimalize the interpretation of the results. 
4	Vitamin C and cardiovascular risk factors. The concept that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplementation protects against coronary heart disease developed in the late 1970s when vitamin C intakes in industrialized nations were lower than at present. Supplementation was then shown to lower plasma total cholesterol and, among some elderly men, to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, among people in initially good vitamin C nutriture, these effects are usually not seen. In five populations of essentially healthy people, blood pressure has been found to correlate negatively with vitamin C status. Recently, in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, extra ascorbic acid for 6 wk was observed to lower systolic and pulse pressure in a small group of borderline hypertensive subjects. 
1	Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) uptake in a sympathetic effusion: an index of malignancy and a review of the literature. We report a patient with a sympathetic pleural effusion secondary to T-cell lymphoma that accumulated the bone imaging agent, Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP). This case is significant in that malignant cells were not present on three cytologic examinations of the pleural fluid or multiple pleural biopsies. We also present a review of the published literature on pleural effusions that accumulate bone tracers. We conclude that pleural effusions that accumulate 99mTc-MDP should be considered malignant or secondary to a malignancy and further work-up is essential even if the cytologic exam of the pleural fluid is unremarkable. 
5	Dislocation after total hip arthroplasty. Causes and prevention. In this prospective study, a technique of positioning the acetabulum by bony landmarks of the pelvis in the standing position was developed using a standing lateral preoperative roentgenogram with the X-ray tube centered over the trochanter. Since 1984, 441 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) were done through the posterior approach with a 1.14% dislocation rate through 1988 and no dislocations in 1989. To prevent impingement and dislocation, it was determined that the safest range for cup position was 30 degrees-50 degrees abduction and 20 degrees-40 degrees flexion from the horizontal. To measure postoperative cup position, a standing true lateral roentgenogram of the operated hip allowed direct measurement of cup flexion and was reproducible within 10 degrees. No special instruments are necessary for this technique, which can be used with any THA system. 
5	Epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among young children in Kenya. The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was investigated in a rural community 80 km north of Nairobi, Kenya. This research was conducted prospectively on 250 families with 470 children less than 5 years of age who were contacted every 8 days during the 3-year study. The yearly incidence of respiratory tract infections decreased from 5.2 to 3.4 during the study; less than 5% of these infections involved the lower respiratory tract. The incidence was inversely related to age, and the illnesses were generally mild and brief in length. Fifteen children died during the study period. The precise causes of death are unknown, but respiratory infections possibly played a role in most cases. This study emphasizes the importance of determining the risk factors responsible for unusually severe morbidity and high mortality in children with ARI in developing countries. 
5	Senile dementia and healthy aging: a longitudinal CT study. Volumetric indexes of cerebral atrophy obtained by using computed tomography (CT) were measured longitudinally in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and in healthy elderly control subjects. Measurements were made three times over a 51-month period. Of the original 44 patients with SDAT, five were available for CT examination at the last time of assessment (51 months); in contrast, 41 of the original 58 control subjects were still available for study at 51 months. As a group, scans of SDAT subjects showed greater atrophy than those of control subjects in all volumetric indexes at each time of testing and demonstrated greater progression of atrophy during the study period. However, the overlap of indexes between the patients with SDAT and the control subjects indicates that CT data cannot be used alone to predict the presence or progression of dementia in individual cases. 
1	Systemic therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimens have been utilized in metastatic colorectal cancer for more than 30 years. Early attempts at defining an optimal treatment schedule and use in combination with other drugs failed to significantly improve results. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of fluorouracil has been improved by continuous infusion administration and modulation with folinic acid. Both approaches have increased the response rate compared with results achieved with traditional bolus schedules; the effect on survival has been less significant. Unfortunately, expense and, in some instances, toxicity have also been increased, which detracts from their overall usefulness. Clinical studies that evaluate fluorouracil chemotherapy in combination with biological-response modifiers are ongoing and will be areas of intense research during the next few years. 
4	Diagnostic echocardiographic features of the sinus venosus defect. To establish the diagnostic criteria for a sinus venosus atrial septal defect cross sectional echocardiograms, cineangiograms, and surgical notes of all patients with this diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. Seven patients were identified. In each the extent of the atrial septum and the nature of the junction of the superior vena cava with the atria were evaluated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. All had overriding of the superior vena cava and abnormally connected right pulmonary veins. Six patients had undergone cardiac catheterisation and cineangiography. Five patients underwent surgical repair. The operative findings were consistent with the expected morphology in all five, and these features were additionally confirmed in a specimen from the cardiopathological museum. Therefore, the basic anatomical feature of a superior sinus venosus interatrial communication is a biatrial connection of the superior vena cava. This, together with anomalous drainage of the right sided pulmonary veins, results in an interatrial communication outside the confines of the true atrial septum. Overriding of the superior vena cava across the upper rim of the oval fossa is suggested as the pathognomonic diagnostic feature that can clearly be demonstrated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. In essence the lesion is an interatrial communication rather than an atrial septal defect. 
1	Popliteal artery occlusion caused by cystic adventitial disease: successful treatment by urokinase followed by nonresectional cystotomy. Preoperative diagnosis of an occluded popliteal artery caused by cystic adventitial disease allowed use of urokinase to successfully dissolve secondary thrombosis. Subsequent non-resectional adventitial cystotomy and evacuation of cyst contents allowed lasting restoration of a patent arterial lumen and return of normal distal pulses. This nongrafting technique may serve as a model for future patients with occluded arteries caused by this condition. 
1	Usefulness of epidurally evoked cortical potential monitoring during cervicomedullary glioma surgery. This report describes a patient with an intramedullary ependymoma at the region of the cervicomedullary junction in whom there was an abolition of somatosensory evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation. During intraoperative monitoring of cortical potentials elicited by epidural cervical cord stimulation, the tumor was removed. Posterior epidural stimulation appeared to depolarize more ascending fibers than did stimulation of a single peripheral nerve. We recommend that, in cases of operations in this vital area, epidurally evoked cortical potentials be monitored intraoperatively. 
5	Natural history of progressive ischemic stroke in a population treated with heparin Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke, we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin, another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage, and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke, many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore, frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome. 
5	Decreased protein binding of salicylates in Kawasaki disease. Because patients with Kawasaki disease have low serum concentrations of salicylates despite high doses, and because the free (unbound) drug is responsible for the pharmacologic effects of salicylates, we assessed salicylate protein binding in patients with Kawasaki disease. During the acute phase of the disease, protein binding of salicylate in 36 children with Kawasaki disease was 73 +/- 12%, significantly lower than during the subacute phase (90.4 +/- 8.7%; p less than 0.0005). Mean serum albumin concentration was 29.2 +/- 6.4 gm/L during the acute phase and 36.7 +/- 7.8 gm/L during the subsequent subacute phase (p less than 0.005). Salicylate protein binding was affected independently by both serum albumin and total salicylate levels. During the acute phase of Kawasaki disease, children had an average twofold increase in free salicylate compared with normoalbuminemic control subjects. A nomogram has been devised to derive free salicylate levels from the known total salicylate and serum albumin concentrations. 
4	Single lung transplantation for primary pulmonary hypertension. Single lung transplantation has become a therapeutic option for end-stage interstitial lung disease and obstructive lung disease. Our group recently extended this treatment to three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. All patients had marked decreases in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance and increases in cardiac output following single lung transplantation. Spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were not different in comparison to preoperative studies. Quantitative ventilation-perfusion scans revealed the majority of perfusion distributed to the transplanted lung, with ventilation approximately equally divided between the native and the transplanted lung. Despite ventilation-perfusion imbalance, there was no resting hypoxemia and there was no arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise. One patient expired on the 30th postoperative day due to cytomegalovirus infection of the lungs. In the remaining two patients, maximum exercise capacity following transplantation was near normal in one recipient and reduced in the second recipient. Of note, there was no evidence of ventilatory limitation or impaired oxygenation during exercise in these two recipients. Although an exaggerated exercise ventilatory response was present, this did not limit exercise performance. This report supports the use of single lung transplantation for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. 
5	Xenon-enhanced computed tomographic measurement of cerebral blood flow in patients with chronic subdural hematomas. We compared clinical symptoms with extent of brain shift on computed tomographic (CT) scans and quantitative and three-dimensional measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on xenon-enhanced CT scans in 10 patients with chronic subdural hematomas. Five patients had only headache and minimal or no brain shift on a CT scan. The other five had hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance in addition to headache and moderate or severe brain shift on a CT scan. The mean hemispheric CBF decreased about 7% in patients with headache and about 35% in patients with hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance. It decreased also on the side without the hematoma. The CBF reduction was always more pronounced in the putamen and thalamus than in the cortex. On the contrary, the cortex CBF was mostly preserved or even elevated in both groups of patients. We speculate that CBF reduction in patients with a chronic subdural hematoma occurs initially in central cerebral areas like the basal ganglia and thalamus, and then extends to the entire hemisphere including the cortex as brain compression and displacement progress. Central cerebral area involvement might be more responsible for clinical symptoms than the cortex. 
3	Noradrenergic abnormalities in the central nervous system of seizure-naive genetically epilepsy-prone rats. Norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured in 15 discrete areas of the central nervous system of two types of genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) and in nonepileptic controls. Both moderate-seizure (GEPR-3) and severe-seizure (GEPR-9) animals had extensive abnormalities in brain NE concentration. Deficits of equal magnitude in GEPR-3s and GEPR-9s were found in the spinal cord, midbrain minus the inferior colliculus, inferior colliculus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, occipital + parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and olfactory septum. Because both types of GEPRs share these deficits and share seizure susceptibility, we hypothesize that these areas are candidates for regulation of seizure susceptibility in GEPRs. In addition, because GEPR-9s have more severe seizures than GEPR-3s and because GEPR-9s had greater NE deficits in several brain areas (cerebellum, pons-medulla, thalamus, and possibly the temporal cortex and olfactory bulbs), we hypothesize that these areas may be important in regulation of seizure severity in GEPRs. All animals used in these experiments had been protected from seizure-provoking stimuli and were naive to seizures. Because the abnormalities in NE concentration were present in seizure-predisposed animals that were protected from seizures, we conclude that these abnormalities are important components of the seizure-predisposition characteristic of GEPRs and do not result from seizure experience. 
1	Murine erythroleukemia cell line GM979 contains factors that can activate silent chromosomal human gamma-globin genes. We introduced a normal chromosome 11 into GM979 murine erythroleukemia cells by fusing them with Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from a normal individual. In contrast to previous data obtained with other murine erythroleukemia cells, we detected activation of human chromosomal gamma-globin genes in GM979 cells. GM979, unlike previously used murine erythroleukemia cell lines, expresses murine embryonic globin in addition to adult globin. While all the hybrids expressed gamma- and beta-globin, they displayed a wide range of gamma-globin expression in relation to that of beta-globin. No correlation, however, was found in quantitative expression between murine embryonic globin and human gamma-globin in these hybrids, suggesting that the two globins are regulated independently, at least in this cell line. These data indicate that gamma-globin genes from normal, nonerythroid chromosomes are not irreversibly silenced, and they can be activated by a positive trans factor(s) present in GM979 cells. 
3	Antimigraine treatment for slit ventricle syndrome. Slit ventricle syndrome is characterized by chronic or recurring headaches associated with subnormal ventricular volume in patients who have undergone shunt treatment for hydrocephalus. There appear to be at least three pathophysiological mechanisms that cause this syndrome: 1) intermittent shunt malfunction; 2) intracranial hypotension; and 3) paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure in the presence of normal shunt function. To treat seven patients with slit ventricle syndrome caused by paroxysms of elevated intracranial pressure, we successfully used antimigraine therapy rather than standard calvarial expansion procedures. None of these patients has required shunt revision or calvarial expansion during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. The symptoms of slit ventricle syndrome may be a form of "acquired" migraine in shunt patients. We suggest that, in clinically stable patients with normal shunt function, treatment against migraine may stabilize symptoms resulting from paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure. Such treatment may prevent unnecessary shunt revisions and/or calvarial expansion procedures. 
3	Area of lateral ventricles measured on cranial ultrasonography in preterm infants: association with outcome. The association between measurements of lateral ventricle area (determined by serial ultrasound scans) and outcome was studied in 70 preterm neonates of 33 weeks' gestation or less. The study group was subdivided into four groups according to cranial ultrasonographic findings at 2 weeks postnatal age: group A (n = 15) had isolated periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage; group B (n = 20) had periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage and dilated ventricles; group C (n = 24) had periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia with or without dilated ventricles; and group D (n = 11) had isolated periventricular leukomalacia. Eighty seven preterm infants with no evidence of intracranial disease and good neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years formed the control group. A poor outcome was observed in infants in group B, C, and D, particularly in those who had persistent dilated ventricles at 6 weeks postnatal age and extensive periventricular leukomalacia. There was no difference in outcome between group A and controls. During the first six weeks of life ventricular area growth velocities were significantly higher in groups B, C, D, compared with normal controls and group A. We suggest that persistent ventricular dilatation at this early stage carries a bad prognosis, which is the result of atrophy of the brain. 
5	Somatostatin analogue treatment inhibits post-resectional adaptation of the small bowel in rats. Post-resectional hyperplasia is the phenomenon in which residual small bowel increases in size and absorptive capacity after segmental enterectomy. This experiment studied the effect of somatostatin analogue therapy on the development of two structural parameters of post-resectional hyperplasia in rats subjected to 40% proximal small bowel resection. Octreotide acetate-treated rats failed to develop increased villus height (902 +/- 50 microns) relative to saline-treated rats (1,103 +/- 98 microns). Augmentation of residual intestinal weight was also significantly impaired in analogue-treated rats (92 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 5 mg/cm). We conclude that somatostatin analogue treatment during the early postoperative period does impair the growth of residual bowel in rats. These findings raise concern regarding the use of this drug for postoperative patients who have undergone massive small bowel resection in whom the process of post-resectional adaptation may be critical to allow sustenance with enteral nutrition. 
4	Comparative effects of overweight on cardiovascular risk in younger versus older men. The relation of age and body mass index (BMI) to atherosclerosis risk factors was examined in 357 men. Older (greater than or equal to 45 years) men had higher (p less than 0.01) systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting cholesterol and glucose, and 1-hour glucose and insulin levels. Fasting insulin and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the 2 age groups. Although older men (n = 170) had greater values for several risk factors, overweight (BMI greater than 25.5 kg/m2) increased risk factors more in men younger than 45 years (n = 187). In younger men, those with higher BMIs had a greater prevalence, respectively, of blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg (35.2 vs 11.2%, p less than 0.0001), cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dl (53.5 vs 29.3%, p less than 0.001), fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dl (38.0 vs 10.3%, p less than 0.0001), 1-hour glucose greater than 160 mg/dl (15.5 vs 5.2%, p less than 0.05), fasting insulin greater than 11 microU/ml (28.2 vs 5.2%, p less than 0.0001), and 1-hour insulin greater than 110 microU/ml (28.2 vs 9.5%, p less than 0.001). In contrast, among older men, the prevalence of elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose values was not significantly greater in the subgroup with high BMI. However, elevations of fasting (19.6 vs 6.4%, p less than 0.05) and 1-hour insulin (29.3 vs 11.5%, p less than 0.01) values were more common among older men with higher BMIs. 
2	Dysphagia and esophageal motor dysfunction in gastroesophageal reflux are corrected by fundoplication. Abnormalities in esophageal peristaltic function and acid clearance appear to be responsible for prolonged esophageal acid exposure, a major determinant of the reflux esophagitis and esophageal stricture. We evaluated esophageal motility by manometry in 50 healthy controls and in 35 symptomatic reflux patients before, within 6 months, and 1 year after Nissen fundoplication. Preoperative motility was analyzed in relation to the presence or absence of both nonobstructive dysphagia and erosive esophagitis. We found that (a) preoperative dysphagia was related more to peristaltic dysfunction than to esophagitis; (b) peristaltic wave amplitude and duration were significantly lower than control values in patients with reflux, without correlation to degree of esophagitis or lower esophageal sphincter hypotension; (c) dysphagia ceased in most patients after antireflux surgery at the same time that normal motility was restored independently of lower esophageal sphincter pressure increments. These results suggest that motility disturbances are an important cause of dysphagia in reflux disease, and that reflux is the cause of, rather than the consequence of, peristaltic dysfunction. 
1	Expectant management of localized prostatic cancer. Seventy-five patients with clinical Stage B histologically proven prostatic cancer accumulated over a 40-year period and receiving no therapy for at least 1 year after histologic diagnosis were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-nine patients had Stage B1 lesions, 37 had B2, and nine had B3 lesions; median follow-up for these patients was 124, 120, and 96 months, respectively. Five ultimately received pelvic lymph node dissection with iodine-125 implantation, 23 had transurethral resection of the prostate, and 18 had endocrine therapy. Of those tumors which progressed, 18 of 19 (95%) B1, 26 of 29 (90%) B2, and four of four (100%) B3 lesions demonstrated local progression first. Six of 29 (21%) B1, 17 of 37 (46%) B2, and two of nine (22%) B3 tumors developed recognized distant metastasis. Actuarial survival at 15 years was 67%, 39%, and 63% for patients with B1, B2, and B3 lesions, respectively. These data indicate the varied and potentially protracted course of patients with clinical Stage B prostatic cancer. 
5	Exercise thallium-201 imaging in complete left bundle branch block and the prevalence of septal perfusion defects. To determine the prevalence of septal defects in a generalized referral population, the records of 93 consecutive patients with complete left bundle branch block (BBB) who underwent symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing with thallium-201 myocardial imaging over a 3-year period were reviewed. Segmental analysis of the planar thallium-201 images was performed in a blinded fashion with agreement by consensus. Computerized quantitative analysis of the images also was independently performed, and was correlated with the visual interpretations. Forty-seven patients (51%) had normal images, and 46 (49%) had defects of greater than or equal to 2 segments. In the abnormal studies, only 13 patients (14% of the total population) had septal defects, while a much higher number of patients, 33 (39%), had inferior or apical defects, or both. Coronary angiography was performed in 6 patients with septal defects: Significant narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery was found in 4 patients, a narrowed right coronary artery was found in 1, and normal coronary arteries were seen in the other patient. In conclusion, whereas previous studies have suggested a high percentage of false-positive septal defects in patients with left BBB, this study demonstrates a low prevalence (14%) of septal defects in a large population of unselected patients presenting for exercise thallium-201 imaging. Therefore, exercise thallium-201 imaging remains a useful procedure for evaluating patients with complete left BBB. 
5	Pharmacokinetics of famotidine after intravenous administration in liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine were studied after the administration of a single intravenous dose of 20-mg to seven normal volunteers, six patients with chronic hepatitis, 14 patients with compensated cirrhosis, and seven patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The plasma terminal elimination half-life of famotidine was significantly prolonged and famotidine total body clearance was significantly reduced in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, whose creatinine clearance was 57.2 +/- 6.7 ml/min/1.48 m2, but these changes were not significant in patients with chronic hepatitis (creatinine clearance: 109.2 +/- 10.5 ml/min/1.48 m2) or in patients with compensated cirrhosis (creatinine clearance: 72.2 +/- 26.5 ml/min/1.48 m2 in comparison with normal volunteers. The total volume of distribution at steady state was not significantly different between the normal volunteers and the three groups of patients. Famotidine total body clearance showed a weak but significant correlation with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001), serum albumin level (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01), and serum total bilirubin level (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), which suggested that the reduction in clearance was due in part to the concomitant renal impairment, as well as hepatic dysfunction in these patients. In conclusion, famotidine total body clearance was reduced in decompensated cirrhosis, indicating that the dose schedule requires modification in patients with this condition. 
4	Estimating left ventricular filling pressure during positive end-expiratory pressure in humans. In the critically ill, accurate measurements of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure using pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (Ppao) are important for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In patients receiving positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), Ppao may not reflect LV filling pressure because of elevated pericardial pressure (Ppc). It has been proposed that in humans, Ppc and right atrial pressure (PRA) are equal, so that referencing Ppao to PRA may improve the assessment of LV filling pressure when Ppc is elevated. Similarly, it has also been shown in the dog that nadir Ppao immediately after airway disconnection from PEEP (nadir Ppao), accurately reflects LV filling pressure when LV filling pressure is greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. We examined methods of estimating LV filling pressure using Ppao measurements under conditions in which increases in Ppc were the primary determinants of differences in the two measurements. Using left atrial pressure (PLA) relative to Ppc, called transmural PLA (PLAtm), as LV filling pressure, we compared the accuracy of Ppao, nadir Ppao, and Ppao relative to PRA to reflect PLAtm in 15 postoperative cardiac surgery patients in whom an air-filled pericardial balloon catheter and a left atrial catheter were inserted during surgery. PEEP was sequentially increased from zero to 15 cm H2O. We found that PRA always exceeded Ppc (p less than 0.01) and increased less with PEEP than did Ppc (p less than 0.05). At less than or equal to 5 cm H2O PEEP, both Ppao and nadir Ppao were similar to each other and to PLAtm. 
4	The association of elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine with progression of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Plasma homocyst(e)ine (the sum of free and bound homocysteine, homocystine, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine-cysteine, expressed as homocysteine) levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography in 214 patients with symptomatic (claudication, rest pain, gangrene, amputation) lower extremity arterial occlusive disease and/or symptomatic (stroke, cerebral transient ischemic attacks) cerebral vascular disease and in 103 control persons. Mean plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients than in controls (14.37 +/- 6.89 nmol/ml vs 10.10 +/- 2.16, p less than 0.05). Thirty-nine percent of patients (83 of 214) had plasma homocyst(e)ine values greater than control mean + 2 standard deviations. Plasma homocyst(e)ine values were contrasted to age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, renal failure, and plasma cholesterol. No difference was found in the incidence and/or level of any of these risk factors when patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine were compared to those with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine were more likely to demonstrate clinical progression of lower extremity disease and of coronary artery disease, but not of cerebral vascular disease than were patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine, and the rate of progression was more rapid (p = 0.002). Progression of lower extremity disease as assessed in the vascular laboratory was also more common in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine (p = 0.01). We conclude that elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine is an independent risk factor for symptomatic lower extremity disease or cerebral vascular disease or both. Symptomatic patients with lower extremity disease and with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine also appear to have more rapid progression of disease. 
4	Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. A study was made with intra-operative flash--visual evoked potentials (VEP) monitored using a fibre-optic/contact lens photo stimulator in 57 patients undergoing intra-orbital surgical procedures with potential risk to the optic nerve. The VEPs recorded under enflurane and nitrous oxide anaesthesia did not differ significantly in latency or amplitude from the pre-operative recordings. Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision. The technique provides early warning to the surgeon of threats to the integrity of the optic nerve. 
3	Missed injuries. The trauma surgeon's nemesis. The multiply injured trauma patient presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge: that of discovering all injuries while simultaneously proceeding with resuscitation and maintaining life. Many factors involved in the initial resuscitation of the multiply injured patient, such as altered level of consciousness, hemodynamic instability, or inexperience and diagnostic oversight, may lead to missed injuries. Injuries may be missed at any stage of the management of the trauma patient, including intraoperatively, and may involve all regions of the body. Established protocols in the initial management of the multiply injured patient, such as the primary and secondary surveys of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course, will minimize the chance of missing immediately life-threatening injuries in the emergency department. A careful intraoperative approach must be used in all patients, but especially in those with hemodynamic instability, so that all areas are examined for possible injury, rather than concentrating simply on what is known to be injured. Use of the tertiary survey, a careful re-examination of the multiply injured trauma patient, especially when he or she awakes, will help detect injuries missed during the initial evaluation. Injuries will be missed. Rather than dismissing these as occurrences that happen only to the inexperienced or incompetent, one should approach the multiply injured trauma patient with both special alertness and the humility necessary to search for diagnostic oversights. This approach will lead to early discovery of missed injuries and will minimize the consequences. 
5	Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. Two cases of neurological deterioration and coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension and invasion of the 3rd ventricle are presented. Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. 
1	Hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function. Hepatic malignancies often infiltrate to the major hepatic vein. Recently, we performed hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function in three such patients. One patient had a saphenous vein graft. Postoperative liver function of the patients who underwent hepatic vein reconstruction was compared with those of eight patients who underwent hepatic resection of segments VII and VIII. The right hepatic vein in four of them was resected and in the remaining four was preserved by skeletalization using an ultrasonic aspirator. Although four patients with right hepatic vein resection showed severe lowering of liver function after surgery, the postoperative course of patients with preservation or reconstruction of the right hepatic vein maintained good liver function. Liver regeneration of three patients with hepatic vein reconstruction was good on computed tomography. Besides this report, to our knowledge, there is no other report of hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving the remnant liver function. Problems with hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction are discussed. We conclude that hepatic vein reconstruction is one of the means for extending indication of the malignant tumor resection of the liver. 
5	Iron chelation by deferoxamine inhibits lipid peroxidation during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans. Iron catalysis is involved in oxygen-derived free radical generation and subsequent lipid peroxidation, which have been reported to occur during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans. We assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on the susceptibility of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) to induced peroxidation in 20 adult patients (10 controls and 10 treated) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary or valve procedures. Deferoxamine was given both intravenously (30 mg/kg body wt, starting 30 minutes before bypass and extending for the next 4 hours) and as an additive to the cardioplegic solution (250 mg/l). Blood samples were taken from both atria before and immediately after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content of selectively isolated LDLs after their exposure to a peroxidizing agent. Before cardiopulmonary bypass, the right and left atrial blood values of LDL-TBARS were not significantly different between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in a lipid peroxidation of significantly greater magnitude in control than in treated patients. Postbypass right atrial values for LDL-TBARS (expressed in mumol/mmol LDL-phospholipids) were 45.7 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- SEM) in control patients and 6.9 +/- 2.9 in treated patients (p less than 0.02), whereas in the left atrial blood, LDL-TBARS yielded values of 62.7 +/- 20.5 and 10.3 +/- 3.9, respectively (p less than 0.01). 
3	Bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase for eyelid anesthesia. A double-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if subcutaneous eyelid injections of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture were less painful than unbuffered injections. Twenty-one patients received both buffered (pH = 7.4) and unbuffered (pH = 4.6) injections. After each injection, patients recorded pain on a scale of 0, "no pain," to 10, "severe pain." Mean pain score for buffered injections was 2.0 versus 4.1 for unbuffered injections (P = 0.0003). Seventeen (81%) of 21 patients ranked the buffered injection less painful. Use of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture is effective in making ophthalmic anesthesia less painful. 
4	Stress echocardiography and the human factor: the importance of being expert. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the diagnostic accuracy of a stress echocardiographic procedure, such as a dipyridamole echocardiography test, depends on the specific experience of the physician interpreting the test. Recordings of 50 consecutive dipyridamole echocardiographic tests were selected for the first part of the study. They were analyzed by 20 experienced echocardiographers with different backgrounds in stress echocardiography: 10 beginners (less than 20 stress studies interpreted with trained staff) and 10 experienced observers (greater than or equal to 100 stress studies performed). Diagnostic accuracy (true positive + true negative/total number of tests) versus the angiographic reference standard (greater than 70% coronary stenosis of at least one major coronary artery) was 62 +/- 6% for beginners and 85 +/- 3% for experienced observers (p less than 0.0001). In the second part of the study, 10 observers (5 beginners and 5 experienced observers) evaluated 2 different sets of 50 dipyridamole echocardiographic test studies before and after the training of the beginners. Before training, the accuracy of beginners was lower than that of experienced observers (61 +/- 7% versus 85 +/- 3%; p less than 0.001). After training, the accuracy gap was closed (83 +/- 3% versus 86 +/- 2%; p = NS). Therefore, interpretation of stress echocardiographic tests by an echocardiographer without specific training severely underestimates the diagnostic potential of this technique. One hundred stress echocardiographic studies are more than adequate to build the individual learning curve and reach the plateau of diagnostic accuracy that the test can yield. 
1	Maffucci's syndrome with bilateral cartilaginous tumors of the cerebellopontine angle. Maffucci's syndrome is characterized by the combination of multiple enchondromas (Ollier's disease) and hemangiomatosis. These hemangiomas develop in the subcutaneous tissue and form red-blue tumors dispersed over the whole body. Intracranial involvement is rare, making a preoperative radiological diagnosis and differentiation from other tumors rather difficult. The radiological characteristics and successful removal of the intracranial part of a chondrosarcoma of the cerebellopontine angle in a case of Maffucci's syndrome are reported in this paper. 
5	Sudden cardiac death while wearing a Holter monitor. The Holter tapes of 61 patients (46 men, mean age +/- standard deviation 65 +/- 11 years) with sudden cardiac death while being monitored were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients were known to have coronary artery disease, 5 had cardiomyopathy, and 7 had aortic valve disease. Etiology remained unknown in 11 patients. Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 2.5 +/- 0.7. Thirty patients had received antiarrhythmic drugs and 32 had received digitalis. Sudden death occurred at rest in 73%. In the hours before death, repetitive ventricular arrhythmias were found in 50 patients (82%), with atrial fibrillation in 34%. Patients with bradyarrhythmic death (18%) had less complex ventricular activity compared to patients with tachyarrhythmic death (p less than 0.01). Lethal arrhythmias--monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, primary ventricular fibrillation, and 1:1 conducting atrial tachycardia--were found in 26 (43%), 15 (25%), 5 (8%), 3 (5%), and 1 patient, respectively. The coupling interval of the final ventricular tachycardia correlated inversely with the initial frequency of ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.05). For patients with tachyarrhythmic death, an increase of heart rate within the last 3 hours was noted (83 vs 89 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Ventricular premature complexes and the proportion of patients with greater than 2 couplets and greater than 2 triplets increased significantly only within the last hour before death. 
5	Gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Clinically significant gastroesophageal reflux occurs in one in 500 infants. Symptoms resolve in 60 to 80 percent of infants by 18 months of age. Thickened formula and position changes are often recommended. Medication and surgical intervention may be needed in refractory cases. 
5	A reevaluation of heparin requirements for cardiopulmonary bypass. We wished to determine if reduction in the standard heparin administration for cardiopulmonary bypass could be accomplished safely with the use of membrane oxygenators. An experimental study was designed to evaluate two different heparin administration protocols for cardiopulmonary bypass with hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators. Two groups of six pigs were submitted to hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (28 degrees C) for 3 hours, then rewarmed, decannulated, and reassessed after 1 hour. In group I (control) heparin was administered to maintain the activated clotting time in excess of 450 seconds; in group II activated clotting time was maintained between 250 and 300 seconds. The mean total heparin administered was 41,000 units in group I and 25,000 units in group II. Concentration of coagulation factors II, V, and VIII, fibrinogen, and platelet count were determined before, during, and 1 hour after bypass. No significant difference in any of these coagulation parameters was observed between the groups. The performance of the oxygenators was similar in both groups, with no evidence of thrombosis. Thus reduced heparin administration, enough to keep activated clotting time between 250 and 300 seconds, was not related either to major coagulation factors and platelet consumption or to derangements in the oxygenator's performance. 
5	Complications of stapled anastomoses in anterior resection for rectal carcinoma: colorectal anastomosis versus coloanal anastomosis. Postoperative results of 48 patients who underwent anterior resection using the EEA-stapler were evaluated. In all but 2 cases the indication for surgery was colorectal carcinoma. In 24 patients an anastomosis was created above the 5 cm level (above the anal verge: colorectal anastomosis) and in 24 at the 0-5 cm level (coloanal anastomosis). There was no perioperative mortality. The only complication observed in the colorectal anastomosis group was one case of late anastomotic stenosis. In the coloanal anastomosis group there were 4 cases with early anastomosis leaks, 3 cases with late stenosis and 5 cases with various degrees of late fecal incontinence, ultimately resulting in a permanent diverting stoma in 5 (10.4%) patients. We conclude that for rectal tumors the EEA-stapled anterior resection provides excellent functional results in most cases. Stapled coloanal anastomoses more often demonstrate various (early and late) complications. Nevertheless in spite of chronic discomfort, many patients still prefer their complaints to a permanent stoma. 
4	Nitrendipine-induced gingival hyperplasia. First case report. Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia is well documented within the literature. It has been associated with phenytoin, cyclosporine, and calcium channel blocking agents. Nitrendipine is an experimental calcium channel blocking agent that also appears to cause the side effect of drug-induced gingival hyperplasia. The clinical and histologic presentation of this side effect and possible biochemical mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed. 
4	Angioplasty from the contralateral approach: use of a guiding catheter and coaxial angioplasty balloons. An 8-F guiding catheter has been developed for use with coaxial angioplasty balloon catheters in angioplasty of the femoral artery from the contralateral approach when antegrade puncture of the ipsilateral femoral artery is not possible. The catheter may be used for angioplasty of the femoral artery bifurcation and the superficial femoral artery and for arterial stenoses in patients with renal transplants. 
5	Vasal injuries during childhood and their effect on subsequent fertility. Thirty subfertile males had testicular obstruction following inguinal or pelvic surgery in childhood. All 13 patients with bilateral obstruction were azoospermic and 6 had developed antibodies to spermatozoa. Of 17 patients with unilateral obstruction, 11 had oligozoospermia and 6 had normal sperm counts: all had high titres of antibodies to spermatozoa (a significant difference from the men with bilateral obstruction). This indicates that male infertility can result from vasal or epididymal injuries in childhood due either to the obstruction itself or its immunological consequences. Following corrective surgery and prednisolone treatment for the antibodies, where appropriate, 5/17 patients with unilateral blocks and 1/11 with bilateral blocks successfully produced pregnancies. 
3	Soluble interleukin-2 receptors in cerebrospinal fluid from individuals with various neurological disorders. Soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2R) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were studied in infectious, inflammatory, degenerative, and neoplastic disorders to evaluate their usefulness as a marker for the presence of activated T cells, thus indicating an inflammatory process. CSF from control subjects and patients with stationary, progressive, and treated multiple sclerosis (MS); aseptic meningitis; lymphoid and nonlymphoid central nervous system (CNS) tumors; Alzheimer's disease, as well as serum from MS patients and control subjects were studied for levels of soluble IL-2R. A significant increase in CSF IL-2R levels was observed in patients with MS, meningitis, and lymphoid CNS tumors; the MS group showed the highest values. CSF from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and from patients with nonlymphoid tumors did not show significantly elevated values. Serum IL-2R levels were significantly higher in MS patients than in control subjects, but there was no significant correlation between individual serum and CSF IL-2R levels. This study suggests the presence of activated T-lymphocytes in the CNS of patients with MS. 
2	Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. 
4	Simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography: a new method of stress echocardiography The diagnostic use of exercise echocardiography has been widely reported. However, transthoracic exercise echocardiography is inadequate in up to 20% of patients because of poor image quality related to exercise. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, a system was developed in which transesophageal echocardiography is combined with simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing by means of the same probe. In a prospective study, transesophageal echocardiography was performed before, during and immediately after maximal atrial pacing in 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Results of transesophageal stress echocardiography were considered abnormal when new pacing-induced regional wall motion abnormalities were observed. Correlative routine bicycle exercise testing was carried out in 44 patients. Cardiac catheterization was performed in all patients. The success rate in obtaining high quality diagnostic images was 100% by transesophageal echocardiography. All nine patients without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease had a normal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (100% specificity). Thirty-eight of 41 patients with coronary artery disease (defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing of at least one major vessel) had an abnormal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (93% sensitivity). The sensitivity of the technique for one, two or three vessel disease was 85%, 100% and 100%, respectively, compared with 44%, 50% and 83%, respectively, for bicycle exercise testing; the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during rapid atrial pacing showed a sensitivity of 25%, 64% and 86%, respectively. Thus, rapid atrial pacing combined with simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography is a highly specific and sensitive technique for the detection of coronary artery disease. Ischemia-induced wall motion abnormalities were detected earlier than observed ECG changes. The technique appears to be particularly suited to patients who are unable to perform an active stress test or those with poor quality transthoracic echocardiograms. 
1	Inhibition by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 of chemically induced erythroid differentiation of K562 leukemia cells. The physiologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], was found to inhibit erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells. Differentiation was induced by 1 mumol/L arabinocytosine (Ara-C), 40 mumol/L tiazofurin, 1 mumol/L aphidicolin, or 1 mumol/L hydroxyurea, and was monitored daily by the appearance of hemoglobin in an increasing proportion of cells. Pretreatment for 48 hours with 2.4 x 10(-8) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, a concentration that is also optimal for induction of monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, reproducibly inhibited subsequent induction of erythroid differentiation by all of the above inducers, and modified the morphologic changes that Ara-C produced in these cells. The inhibition of hemoglobinization was approximately 50% irrespective of the degree of differentiation produced by the various inducers, but growth inhibition associated with exposure to the inducers was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Similar inhibition of differentiation by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in mouse erythroleukemia cells MEL-D1B treated with 5 mmol/L hexamethylenebisacetamide. The inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was abrogated by cyclohexamide (20 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The mRNA for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) was detected in K562 cells, and was downregulated by a 96-hour exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or a 48-hour exposure to Ara-C. The presence of VDR mRNA suggests a physiologic role for 1,25(OH)2D3 in K562 cells that are precursors of erythroid cells. This role is perhaps to shift the pathways of differentiation from the erythroid to the monocytic lineage. 
3	Antecedent medical diseases in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A population-based case-controlled study in Rochester, Minn, 1925 through 1987. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for the prevalence of antecedent endocrine, metabolic, or vascular diseases among 45 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from the Rochester, Minn, population compared with 90 control subjects matched for sex, year of birth, period of observation, and residence. Hypertension occurred less frequently in male patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4%) than in control subjects (30%; OR = .10). Because of small population size, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the following antecedent conditions: thyroid disease (OR = 1.61), coronary artery disease (OR = .58), obesity (OR = .52), diabetes (OR = 1.00), cerebrovascular disease (OR = .21), and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.23). The heterogeneity of antecedent thyroid disease makes it highly unlikely that any specific thyroid lesion is causally associated with most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hypertension may be a marker for protective factors against the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in men. 
5	Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. I. Enhanced tolerance of immature versus adult myocardium to global ischemia with reference to metabolic differences. This study compares the metabolism and functional responses of adult and immature hearts to a standard ischemic insult. Ten adult dogs (25 to 27 kg) and 10 puppies (6 to 10 weeks old) underwent 45 minutes of aortic clamping on bypass. Preoperative and postoperative ventricular performance (Starling curves), biochemical factors, and water content were measured. Global ischemia in adults produced a 30% mortality rate (3/10) and low output syndrome in survivors (33% recovery of stroke work index). Conversely, all puppies survived and stroke work index returned to 85% of control, with less edema developing (0.4% versus 2% water gain, p less than 0.05). Puppies expended comparable glycogen stores but used more glutamate (15.4 versus 8.6 mumol/gm dry weight), produced more alanine (18.9 versus 6.4 mumol, p less than 0.05), succinate (19 versus 8.2 mumol, p less than 0.05), and malate (2.6 versus 0.15 mumol, p less than 0.05) during ischemia, and recovered better postischemic aerobic metabolism (410 versus 255 nmol tissue pyruvate, p less than 0.05). We conclude that tolerance of immature hearts to ischemia is related to amino acid utilization by transamination and increased substrate level phosphorylation, as occurring in diving mammals, suggesting retention of intrautero adaptive mechanisms. 
1	Treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin. Based on in vitro studies that have demonstrated synergy between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and cisplatin (CDDP) against human colon cancer cell lines, a clinical trial was initiated to determine the effects of this combination in patients with advanced unresectable colorectal carcinoma. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study and 12 of them had received prior conventional 5-FU chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly courses of high-dose LV (200 mg/m2) administered by intravenous (IV) bolus, followed by 5-FU (550 mg/m2) and CDDP (20 mg/m2) each administered as a 2-hour infusion on 4 consecutive days. After a median of 5.5 treatment cycles, objective tumor response was seen in 20 of 59 patients (34%) (this included 3 complete remissions). The response rate in the 47 previously untreated patients was 38% (95% confidence limits, 26% to 53%). Stable disease occurred in 16 (27%) patients, whereas the tumor progressed in 23 (39%) patients. The median survival time was 11.5 months, with 15% of the patients alive at 2 years. The regimen was well tolerated and the primary side effects were mild and reversible gastrointestinal symptoms and myelosuppression. There was no episode of life-threatening toxicity. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Grade III adverse reactions that required 25% dose reductions occurred in only 14% of the patients. The results of this trial suggest that 5-FU, LV, and CDDP is an active, safe, and well-tolerated combination regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 
5	Short stature, mental retardation, and hypoparathyroidism: a new syndrome. Eight children (four boys and four girls) with extreme failure to thrive, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypoparathyroidism, and abnormal skeletal survey were studied. They were the products of seven consanguinous marriages, two of the patients being brothers. In the remaining six families, a further four children had affected siblings who had died in infancy. When assessed the children were aged 0.47-12.8 years; SD scores were less than -2 for height, weight, and head circumference in all patients. The children had identical facies with deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge with beaked nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, micrognathia, and large floppy earlobes. They were all developmentally retarded. The following abnormalities were found on investigation: hypocalcaemia in all (of whom six of seven had hypoparathyroidism), medullary stenosis and other skeletal survey defects in seven of the eight children, and reduced numbers of T cell subsets in four of four tested. We believe that these children represent a new, as yet undescribed genetically determined syndrome. 
2	Clinicopathological features of elevated lesions of the duodenal bulb. We present here our findings on patients with an elevated lesion of the duodenal bulb. All these patients were treated in our clinics between the years 1984 and 1988. These lesions were present in 36 of 8,802 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal pan-endoscopy. Two patients had a duodenal carcinoma, 2 an adenoma, and 1 a Brunner's gland adenoma. There were 15 with a hyperplastic polyp, 3 with a heterogenic gastric mucosa, 3 with Brunner's gland hyperplasia, 6 with duodenitis, and 4 with regenerative mucosa. Among these 36 lesions, only 69% (25 lesions) were evident on the upper gastrointestinal X-ray series. Adenoma and Brunner's gland adenoma were of a pedunculated form of the gross type and had an irregular surface mucosa. Both duodenal carcinomas were detected by endoscopic biopsy and were resected. Histologically, these lesions were limited to the submucosal layer and were of the non-pedunculated polypoid form, but there were no other characteristic endoscopic features, in comparison with other elevated lesions. Thus, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with routine observations of the duodenal bulb plus endoscopic biopsy will lead to a definite diagnosis of these elevated lesions and to the early detection and treatment of this rare malignant lesion. 
2	Mallory-Weiss syndrome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We report hematemesis from Mallory-Weiss tears after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A computer search of the English language literature disclosed only 3 similar cases, and we review them. This complication of CPR may occur more frequently than recognized and should be prevented by careful technique. 
4	Usefulness of color-flow Doppler in diagnosing and in differentiating supracristal ventricular septal defect from right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Color-flow Doppler is used for special localization of cardiac flows. The transeptal jet in supracristal ventricular septal defect (VSD) is directed toward the pulmonary valve and is often difficult to distinguish from the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract flow. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler can misread the VSD jet as a stenotic lesion in the RV outflow tract. This study describes the color-flow Doppler characteristics of supracristal VSD and determines if color-flow Doppler can differentiate supracristal VSD jets from RV outflow tract flow. The study group comprised 28 patients ranging in age from 3 days to 23 years (mean 6.4), with catheter-diagnosed supracristal VSD in 14, isolated pulmonary valve stenosis in 10 and RV infundibular obstruction in 4. The echocardiographic Doppler and color-flow Doppler data of all patients were reviewed without knowledge of catheterization diagnosis. In all patients with supracristal VSD, color-flow Doppler revealed an abnormal transeptal jet directed toward the pulmonary valve that occurred 5 to 10 ms before RV outflow tract flow was identified. VSD and RV outflow tract jet could be differentiated by pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler alone in 10 of 14 patients (71%). In 4 patients, differentiation was possible only with color-flow Doppler and electrocardiographic gating. Associated aortic regurgitation, or a fistula, or both, were detected in 6 patients. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler with or without color-flow Doppler correctly identified the level of obstruction in all patients with RV outflow tract lesions (14 of 14). Supracristal VSD jet occurs in early systole and is directed toward the pulmonary valve. 
1	Selection of therapy for stage III breast cancer. Locally advanced breast cancer is a heterogenous group including both operable and inoperable lesions. Local surgery or radiation alone produces poor survival rates, indicating micrometastases at diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy as part of multimodality regimens has increased the length and rate of disease-free survival. 
5	Leukemia initiated by hemopoietic stem cells expressing the v-abl oncogene. We report a mouse model with which to study leukemogenesis initiated by a specific genetic change introduced into a primary lymphoid-myeloid pluripotent stem cell. Fetal liver hemopoietic cells were infected with a high titer of helper-free Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and were used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Two weeks later, progenies of a single primitive hemopoietic stem cell carrying a specifically integrated A-MuLV proviral DNA could be detected in both colony-forming units in spleen and myeloid colony-forming cells in the bone marrow. Beginning at 3 weeks after transplantation, the recipients developed elevated leukocyte counts, splenomegaly, and increase of blast cells in the peripheral blood. Multiple clones of A-MuLV-infected cells were infused into each recipient. However, in the same animal, DNA extracted from various affected organs and from factor-independent lymphoid and myeloid immortalized cells all contained an identical, specifically integrated proviral genome. The A-MuLV-infected stem cells differentiated into various lineages of hemopoietic cells. Our data show that the expression of the v-abl oncogene in a primary lymphoid-myeloid hemopoietic stem cell directly initiates leukemogenesis by stimulating factor-independent growth. The monoclonal-type disease development seen in these animals may require the occurrence of an additional genetic event. 
3	Evaluation of minor head trauma in children younger than two years. The recent medical literature emphasizes the limitations of skull films in the evaluation of minor head trauma. However, the emergency medicine literature places little emphasis on the particular risks in children younger than 2 years old with blunt head injury. These children have immature bone and unfused sutures that may increase risk of cranial injury and delayed complications. A case is presented to illustrate this point. Unlike severe head trauma, where evaluation is directed toward computed tomography, the literature continues to be controversial regarding the indications for skull radiographs and computed tomography in minor head trauma. The authors recommend a low threshold for radiographic imaging in blunt heat injuries in children younger than 2 years. 
3	Spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease. We studied two spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms, recurrent (Renshaw) inhibition and reciprocal inhibition, in seven patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease in order to determine their contribution to the pathogenesis of rigidity. Recurrent inhibition, studied in the leg, did not differ from that found in normal subjects. All three periods of reciprocal inhibition, studied in the forearm, were present but reduced in magnitude compared with those observed in normal subjects. The arms, whether more symptomatic or less symptomatic, gave similar results. The diminution of all three periods of reciprocal inhibition is similar to the findings in patients with dystonia and is apparently indicative of an abnormal supraspinal influence on spinal mechanisms in these two disorders of basal ganglia function. 
5	Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts. Two year results in thirty-six patients [published erratum appears in Am J Sports Med 1991 May-Jun;19(3):272] Thirty-six of 44 patients (82%) who underwent ACL reconstruction using freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts were evaluated at least 2 years postoperatively. A detailed subjective evaluation using the Lysholm scale was recorded as well as a functional evaluation using the Tegner activity scale. All of the patients received a detailed physical examination that included testing with the KT-1000 ligament arthrometer and the Cybex dynamometer. Complete chart reviews and radiographic evaluations were also obtained. Only 17 patients were considered to be functionally successful and performing at their desired activity level. The average KT-1000 showed a side-to-side difference of 5.9 mm at 30 pounds for the successful group and 7.9 mm for those who had functional failure. The Lysholm scores were 91.6/100 versus 61.1/100 in the failures. Eight patients (22%) at repeat surgery were noted to have complete dissolution of the graft. Large femoral cysts were noted radiographically in all of these patients. It was concluded that freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts have a high failure rate and cannot be recommended for ACL reconstruction. 
5	Growth and spread of hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of 240 consecutive autopsy cases. All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors. It appears that not only primary tumor size but also its macroscopic type has an important influence on the growth and spread of HCC. 
3	Fulminant hepatitis after lisinopril administration. A case of fulminant hepatitis in a patient taking lisinopril for 5 weeks for arterial hypertension is reported. Jaundice, fever, myalgia, and marked increase in serum aminotransferase activities occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Continuation of lisinopril administration for 3 weeks after the onset of jaundice was associated with the development of grade III encephalopathy and a marked decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels. This case strongly suggests that lisinopril may induce acute hepatitis and that continuation of the treatment after the onset of jaundice can lead to life-threatening hepatic failure. 
3	Impairment of sequences of memory-guided saccades after supplementary motor area lesions. Different paradigms of saccades were recorded electro-oculographically in 2 patients with infarction affecting the left supplementary motor area. Saccades made toward visual targets (visually-guided saccades) or away from them (antisaccades) were normal in both patients. Memory-guided saccades, made to the remembered position of a flash occurring 2 seconds before, were preserved in 1 patient and only slightly impaired in the other. However, sequences of two or three memory-guided saccades were severely impaired in both patients. It has previously been reported that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in programming sequential limb movements. Our data suggest that this area plays a similar role in the control of sequential eye movements. 
5	Interleukin-6 mRNA and protein increase in vivo following induction of acute thrombocytopenia in mice. Induction of experimental thrombocytopenia in rodents results in the enhancement of megakaryocytic growth and differentiation. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-6, cytokines with a broad spectrum of biologic activities, stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro. To determine if expression of these factors might increase in response to experimental thrombocytopenia, we measured steady-state levels of IL-3 and IL-6 mRNA following rabbit antiplatelet serum (APS) injection. Groups of mice were injected intravenously with 0.2 mL APS while control animals received rabbit antilymphocyte serum (ALS), normal rabbit serum (NRS), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At various times up to 72 hours after injection mice were exsanguinated and splenectomized. Platelet counts in the experimental animals were less than 12% of controls. Splenic RNA was hybridized in solution to 32P-UTP-labeled cRNA probes for IL-3 and IL-6. RNase-resistant hybrids were resolved on denaturing gels and visualized autoradiographically. IL-3 hybrids were undetectable at all time points tested, irrespective of the film exposure time or specific activity of the probe. Conversely, IL-6 hybrids were easily visualized and showed peak expression at 1.5 to 2.0 hours. By 3 hours, IL-6 mRNA had returned almost to the level of the controls. Similar results were observed in the bone marrow, although maximal IL-6 mRNA in that tissue was observed 4 hours following APS administration. To determine if this mRNA increment was associated with a concomitant increase in bioactive protein, serum was tested for its ability to stimulate IL-6-dependent B9 cells. At 1.75 hours following injection, experimental animals showed a small but significant increment in IL-6 activity compared with controls (200 +/- 30 U/mL IL-6 compared with 129 +/- 17 U/mL in ALS-injected controls, 106 +/- 17 U/mL in NRS-injected controls and 84 +/- 17 U/mL in PBS-injected controls). The data show that IL-6 mRNA and bioactive protein increase in response to acute immunothrombocytopenia, while no increment in IL-3 is detectable. These results suggest that IL-6 may play a role in the physiologic response to acute immunothrombocytopenia. 
2	Crack-related perforated gastropyloric ulcer. Cocaine is a potent topical vasoconstrictor that causes nasal mucosal and dermal ulceration. Use of the purified cocaine derivative "crack" has reached epidemic proportions in large cities. In 18 months we operated on 24 patients with perforated peptic ulcers. Five of the patients were young (27-38 years) male crack users without prior history of gastric symptoms who presented with a perforated gastric ulcer related to smoking crack. Three had had symptoms for only 1-5 days before admission. All five were afebrile, had a rigid abdomen, normal leukocyte count, and free intraabdominal air upon radiography. Five other age-matched, non-crack-using patients served as case controls. Their duration of symptoms was 1-24 months, they had elevated leukocyte counts on admission, and, in contrast to the crack users, four of these patients had duodenal perforations. The clinical presentation of the crack smokers and the unusual localization of the perforations imply different pathogenetic mechanisms than are commonly seen in perforated ulcer disease. With increasing abuse of crack, greater numbers of patients with this new complication may be expected to present to emergency services in urban areas. 
4	Nitrous oxide does not alter infarct volume in rats undergoing reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. This experiment was designed to determine if nitrous oxide alters neurologic and pathologic outcome from temporary focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats deeply anesthetized with a barbiturate. Two groups of rats were given intravenous methohexital such that a stable EEG pattern of burst suppression was achieved. In one group of rats (n = 11), the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% N2O/30% O2, and in the other group (n = 10), ventilation was done with 70% nitrogen/30% O2. The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 2 h, during which time mean arterial pressure, blood gases, hematocrit, plasma glucose, and head temperature were held constant between groups. The total doses of methohexital administered were similar in both groups as were the plasma methohexital concentrations immediately prior to onset of ischemia. After reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery, the animals were allowed to awaken. Neurologic evaluations were performed prior to ischemia and at 24 and 96 h postischemia. Cerebral infarct volume was measured at 96 h postischemia using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and computer imaging techniques. There were no neurologic differences between the N2O and nitrogen groups at any experimental interval although both groups exhibited deficits at both 24 and 96 h postischemia relative to preischemic values. The two groups also had nearly identical cerebral infarct volumes (N2O = 231 +/- 97 mm3; nitrogen = 226 +/- 75 mm3; mean +/- SD). 
1	Fatal disseminated mycobacterial infection following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We describe a fatal case of disseminated mycobacteriosis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. We summarize the prior safety record of this therapeutic modality, discuss local and systemic pathophysiological mechanisms by which dissemination might have occurred, and review the reported clinical experience with antituberculous chemotherapy for significant bacillus Calmette-Guerin infection. Finally, we offer suggestions for prophylaxis of certain patients with a history of exposure to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. 
3	Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine. We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction. 
5	Full recovery after a chloroquine suicide attempt. The nonfatal case of a 20 year-old woman who ingested 6 grams of chloroquine in a suicide attempt is reported. After initial ventricular fibrillation, she rapidly developed a pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock. She was successfully treated with diazepam, epinephrine, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation. Plasma chloroquine levels showed an initial peak of 36 micrograms/mL. The patient was discharged fully recovered after 19 days. The interaction between chloroquine and diazepam is discussed, as is the need for careful management of epinephrine therapy. 
2	Immune competent cells of regional lymph nodes in colorectal cancer patients: I. Flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subpopulation. Lymphocyte subpopulations of the regional lymph nodes in 20 colorectal cancer patients were measured by flow cytometry to analyze nodal lymphocytes phenotypically. Eleven patients with cholelithiasis were used as controls. Comparison of lymphocyte subpopulations between colorectal cancer and control groups revealed a significantly increased rate of Leu-12+ cells in the cancer patients. Furthermore, a significant increase of Leu-3a+ Leu-8- cells and a significant decrease of Leu-3a+ Leu-8+ cells were also found in the paracolic nodes of the cancer patients. However, Leu-2a+ Leu-15- cells were not different between the both groups. Meanwhile, in the cancer patients, the rates of Leu-4+, Leu-3a+, and Leu-3a+ Leu-8- cells were higher in the paracolic nodes compared with the intermediate nodes. Additional investigation of the correlation between clinicopathological features of the tumors and lymphocyte subpopulations, showed that Leu-12+ cells were related to the tumor size and Leu-2a+ 15- cells related to the histopathological type. The foregoing results indicate that the rates of both B and helper T cells, which may specifically participate in the antibody production, increase in the regional lymph nodes of colorectal cancer patients. 
3	The disabled driver: an unmet challenge. A survey was undertaken to determine if driving impairment secondary to a disabling injury is addressed in state licensing laws and training programs. In 35 states drivers submit voluntarily to reevaluation after disabling injuries, but no provision is made for reporting such individuals. Only 15 states authorize physicians to report impaired drivers, and only seven require such reporting. Based on a survey of licensing bureaus in the capital or a major city of every state, clerks (who are likely to be the source of information to injured persons) are generally not aware of reporting requirements and supervisors are only slightly better informed. Of the 100 rehabilitation centers surveyed, only 36 provided on-site training for disabled drivers. Voluntary submission for reevaluation after head injury does not often occur. Despite being asked to do so, none of the 35 head injured patients, followed up to two years post-onset, sought reevaluation, although 21 had resumed regular driving. Two of the 21 were involved in subsequent traffic accidents. Common guidelines need to be established across states to ensure reevaluation of individuals with disabling conditions, delivery of accurate information concerning licensing, and availability of training programs. 
3	Cluster headache: the effect of low oxygen saturation The present study concerns the possible relationship between hypoxia and the generation of cluster headache attacks. Fifteen controls and 25 cluster headache patients were studied. The patients were allocated into two groups according to cluster headache stage, i.e. cluster or remission period. During the tests, all the subjects were asked to inhale 12% oxygen (88% N2) for 30 min, and the decreasing oxygen saturation (SaO2%) was monitored. Patients in the remission period showed nearly the same decrement of SaO2% as controls. At the end of the test, patients in the bout showed significantly less reduction of SaO2% than the controls. In 5 patients, the test was carried out both in and outside the cluster periods. The tendency to less decrement in oxygen saturation in the cluster phase was as marked with this comparison, but the difference between the groups was not significant, probably partly due to the low number of tests carried out. Only one patient got a typical attack. It seems that hypoxia of this magnitude per se is not the cause of attacks. The different pattern with respect to SaO2% following 12% O2 inhalation in cluster headache may be due to an abnormality in central regulation and/or chemoreceptor sensitivity. 
1	The effects of sucralfate suspension and diphenhydramine syrup plus kaolin-pectin on radiotherapy-induced mucositis. A prospective, double-blind study compared the effectiveness of sucralfate suspension with diphenhydramine syrup plus kaolin-pectin in reducing severity and pain of radiation-induced oropharyngeal mucositis. Fourteen patients who received at least 4600 cGy to the oral cavity used one of the mouth rinses four times a day, beginning at 1600 cGy. Data were collected on daily perceived pain and helpfulness of mouth rinse, weekly mucositis grade, weight change, and interruption of therapy. Analysis of data revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any parameter. A retrospective review of 15 patients who had received at least 4600 cGy radiation to the oropharynx but had not used a daily mouth-coating rinse, was compared with the study group. Comparison of the two groups suggested that consistent daily oral hygiene and use of a mouth-coating agent will result in less pain and may reduce weight loss and interruption of radiation because of severe mucositis. 
3	Reverse coitus: mechanism of urethral injury in male partner. Reverse coitus, a rarely used sexual position, makes the male urethra more vulnerable to injury from the pubic arch and symphysis pubis of the female partner. Severe pain, bleeding and immediate detumescence were observed in 3 patients. The lesion usually occurred at the fossa navicularis, responded well to conservative management and did not hinder micturition. Potency has been well preserved in all 3 patients. 
4	Central retinal artery obstruction in herpes zoster ophthalmicus and cerebral vasculopathy. We present a case of acute central retinal artery obstruction in association with Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and delayed cerebral vasculopathy. Retinal vascular obstruction is rare in zoster, and its occurrence during postherpetic cerebral vasculopathy has not been reported previously to our knowledge. The syndrome of delayed cerebral vasculopathy is discussed as is its possible relationship to central retinal artery obstruction. 
5	Enteric neuronal autoantibodies in pseudoobstruction with small-cell lung carcinoma. Severe gastrointestinal dysmotility is a newly recognized paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs with small-cell lung carcinoma. Thirty-four patients with small-cell carcinoma, of whom 5 had chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction and 29 had no digestive symptoms, were studied serologically. Four of the 5 patients with gut dysmotility had immunoglobulin G antibodies reactive with neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of jejunum and stomach in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies of this type were not found in any of the 29 patients who had no gut dysmotility, nor were they found in patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 8), ovarian cancer (n = 20), or epilepsy (n = 4) or in normal subjects (n = 9). In 4 of the patients with paraneoplastic pseudoobstruction, antibodies in highly diluted serum (1:4000-1:8000) bound selectively to nuclei and cytoplasm of neuronal elements in the gut. This novel autoantibody activity suggests that intestinal pseudoobstruction occurring in patients with small-cell carcinoma may have an autoimmune basis. From a clinical standpoint, serological testing offers a simple means for determining which patients with gut dysmotility syndromes may have associated small-cell carcinoma, thereby enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment of the tumor. 
1	Genetics and biology of human ovarian teratomas. I. Cytogenetic analysis and mechanism of origin. One hundred and two benign, mature ovarian teratomas and two immature, malignant teratomas were karyotyped and scored for centromeric heteromorphisms as part of an ongoing project to determine the chromosomal karyotype and the genetic origin of ovarian teratomas and to assess their utility for gene-centromere mapping. Karyotypic analysis of the benign cases revealed 95 46,XX teratomas and 7 chromosomally abnormal teratomas (47,XXX, 47,XX,+8 [two cases], 47,XX,+15, 48,XX,+7,+12 91,XXXX,-13 [mosaic], 47,XX,-15,+21,+mar). Our study reports on the first cases of tetraploidy and structural rearrangement in benign ovarian teratomas. The two immature cases had modal chromosome numbers of 78 and 49. Centromeric heteromorphisms that were heterozygous in the host were homozygous in 65.2% (n = 58) of the benign teratomas and heterozygous in the remaining 34.8% (n = 31). Chromosome 13 heteromorphisms were the most informative, with 72.7% heterozygosity in hosts. The cytogenetic data indicate that 65% of teratomas are derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I and failure of meiosis II (type II) or endoreduplication of a mature ovum (type III); 35% arise by failure of meiosis I (type I) or mitotic division of premeiotic germ cells (type IV). 
2	Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective analysis of 100 initial patients Laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly emerged as an alternative to open cholecystectomy. However its safety, efficacy, and morbidity have yet to be fully evaluated. During the first 6 months of 1990, we performed 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 8% (8 of 100 patients; 4 major, 4 minor). There were 81 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 46.1 years (range, 17 to 84 years). All patients had a preoperative history consistent with symptomatic biliary tract disease, and most had proved gallstones by sonography. This included four patients with acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time improved significantly from month 1 to month 6 (122 +/- 45.4 minutes versus 78.5 +/- 30 minutes, respectively), indicating a rapid learning curve. Mean hospital stay was 27.6 hours, reflecting a policy of overnight stay. Postoperative narcotic requirements were limited to oral or no medications in more than 70% of patients. A regular diet was tolerated by 83% of the patients by the morning following the procedure. Median time of return to full activity was 12.8 +/- 6.8 days after operation. In addition analysis of the hospital costs of these 100 cases demonstrates a modest cost advantage over standard open cholecystectomy (n = 58) (mean, $3620.25 +/- $1005.00 versus $4251.76 +/- $988.00). There was one minor bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion, two postoperative bile collections, and one clinical diagnosis of a retained stone that passed spontaneously. Four patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of technical difficulties with the dissection. Although there is a significant learning curve, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by surgeons who are trained in biliary surgery and knowledgeable in biliary anatomy, and, as with all operations, it should be performed with meticulous attention to technique. 
3	Standard v lightweight wheelchair propulsion in spinal cord injured patients. Twenty-six male SCI subjects (six quadriplegics, eight "high paraplegics," and 12 "low paraplegics") propelled both standard and lightweight wheelchairs at a "sprint pace" (Sp) for 400 feet, and at a "duration pace" (Du) for four continuous minutes. Pulse, blood pressure and respirations were measured before and after each trial, and V was calculated. Appropriate training and rest periods were given; order of wheelchair testing was randomized. A questionnaire was later administered. Variations in pulse, systolic blood pressure, and respirations were significant between myelopathic levels (P less than 0.01), but were not affected by the type of wheelchair used. Quadriplegic V was less (P less than 0.01) than that of either paraplegic group for Sp and Du trials; for Sp, lightweight wheelchair V is faster (P less than 0.01) than standard wheelchair V for all groups. 
4	Five-year results of coronary bypass grafting for patients older than 70 years: role of internal mammary artery. Despite numerous references to the superiority of the internal mammary artery (IMA) over the saphenous vein for myocardial revascularization, its role in the elderly is still in question. From January 1984 through December 1988, 1,081 patients older than 70 years (mean age, 74.9 years) underwent bypass grafting, 354 (33%) receiving left IMA grafts based on the surgeon's preference and 727 (67%) receiving vein grafts only. Selection bias resulted in a higher incidence of known risk factors (such as cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, wall motion abnormalities, and preoperative combined New York Heart Association/Canadian Cardiovascular Association functional class IV) in patients in whom the IMA was not used. However, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, and left main disease were not contraindications for using IMA grafts. The operative mortality rate was significantly lower in IMA patients (2.8% versus 7.6%). The actuarial 5-year survival rate (standard error) was higher in patients with IMA grafts, 89% (3%) versus 78% (2%), and postoperative functional class improved to a greater extent in IMA patients (87% of patients were in classes I and II). Arrhythmias and myocardial infarction were significant causes of late death only in patients with vein grafts. When patients are older than 70 years, patient selection factors clearly play an important role in the differential results between patients in whom the IMA is used and patients in whom vein grafts are used. As in younger patients, excellent results can be achieved in the elderly. 
1	Interferon alpha and etretinate combination treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eleven patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination (seven patients) or alone. Two patients, one in combined treatment, went into clinical complete remission, and five experienced partial remission. Two patients progressed during therapy, and two were nonevaluable because they stopped treatment early due to side effects. Dosages of interferon were from 3 to 36 million units daily for 3 months, and thereafter 3 times weekly. Etretinate (0.7 mg/kg) was given orally. The study showed that recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination with etretinate or alone can induce remission of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 
3	Orocaecal transit time in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Smooth muscle degeneration may occur in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We measured fasting orocaecal transit time in patients with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other muscular dystrophies and in healthy controls. No significant differences were found. In contrast to reports of gastric hypomotility in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we found no evidence of impaired small intestinal motility. 
3	Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established. 
2	Inter- and intraindividual variation in pressure-volume relations of the rectum in normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. The relation between intrarectal volume and pressure during increasing rectal distension by a latex balloon were studied on repeated occasions in 10 healthy adult volunteers to define variations within and between individuals. A wide intersubject variation in the maximum tolerable volume (58-908 ml) and pressure (12.2-108.8 cm H2O) at this end point was seen, and these two values were correlated (r = 0.78). Intrasubject variation in maximum tolerable volume also occurred which was related to study order and progressively reduced with repeated study. In 26 unselected patients with pain predominant irritable bowel syndrome similar intersubject variation was noted and virtually all patients data fell within the calculated 95% confidence limits of the normal individuals. Differentiation between patients and normal subjects was not possible from knowledge of rectal responses. These noticeable inter- and intrasubject variations in rectal responses to distension need to be considered whenever similar techniques are proposed for use in the study of rectal disease or of rectal response to treatment. 
4	Treatable complications in undiagnosed cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In a study to determine the proportion of unrecognised cases and the prevalence of treatable complications of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 46 probands were identified through genetics and renal clinics in Melbourne, Australia. 321 offspring of the probands who were older than 15 years and had not been previously diagnosed as having ADPKD were identified. 68 (21%) had ultrasound evidence of polycystic kidney disease. Of this previously undiagnosed group, 25 (37%) had one or more treatable complications at the time of diagnosis. The complications included 20 cases of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 mm Hg or above), 7 cases of impaired renal function (serum creatinine 0.12 mmol/l or above), and 4 cases of bacterial urinary tract infection. 8 people had several complications. ADPKD has an important treatable component which is not being treated in a substantial proportion of affected individuals, because the disease is not being diagnosed despite the presence of a positive family history. 
5	Is primary repair of gastroschisis and omphalocele always the best operation? Optimal surgical management of neonates with gastroschisis and omphalocele remains controversial. Suggested benefits of primary fascial closure include earlier return of gastrointestinal function, decreased hospital stay, less sepsis, less risk of postoperative intestinal obstruction and fistulae, and lower mortality. Between 1978 and 1989, 40 neonates with gastroschisis or omphalocele underwent repair. Primary fascial repair was performed in 30 children, 18 of whom had a gastroschisis and 12 of whom had an omphalocele. Ten children had staged repair with the use of a silastic silo; seven of these had a gastroschisis and three an omphalocele. Comparison between the groups was made regarding birth weight, days on the ventilator before and after surgery, days to first feeding, days in the hospital after surgery, postoperative complications, and survival. There was no significant difference in birth weight, days on the ventilator, days to first feeding, and postoperative days in the hospital. There were nine complications in nine patients (30%) with primary repair and four complications in two patients (20%) with staged repair. Two infants died after primary repair (6.7%), and one (10%) died after staged closure. It was concluded that silastic silo repair and primary fascial closure are both acceptable alternatives. Primary closure is attractive whenever possible to avoid additional operations. 
5	Acute coronary artery occlusion during and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Frequency, prediction, clinical course, management, and follow-up [published erratum appears in Circulation 1991 Jul;84(1):446] BACKGROUND. Acute coronary artery occlusion after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) continues to remain a serious complication despite significant improvement in operator performance and technological advancements. This retrospective study was performed to ascertain the frequency, predictive variables, management, and outcome of acute coronary artery occlusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. The study was based on data from 1,423 consecutive patients who underwent an elective coronary angioplasty between January 1986 and December 1988. Acute coronary artery occlusion occurred in 104 patients (7.3%). Acute occlusion developed during the dilatation procedure in 80 patients (5.6%) and within 24 hours after the procedure in 24 patients (1.7%). Four clinical and 14 angiographic variables predictive for acute coronary artery occlusion were analyzed in these 104 patients with a complicated procedure and were compared with those in 104 representative patients with successful attempts. Multivariate analysis found three independent predictive variables: unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. The overall clinical outcome after management of acute coronary artery occlusion including immediate repeat dilatation (95 patients), use of intracoronary streptokinase (34 patients), or autoperfusion catheter (12 patients) was successful (reduction of lumen diameter to less than 50%, no death, no myocardial infarction [MI], and no emergency surgery) in 42 patients (40%), was a failure without major complication in four patients (4%), and was a failure with major complication (death, MI, and emergency surgery) in 58 patients (56%). The overall mortality rate was 6% (six patients), the overall MI rate was 36% (37 patients), and emergency bypass surgery was required in 30% of patients (31 patients). At 6 months' follow-up of 42 patients with successful management, recurrent angina pectoris due to restenosis occurred in 10 patients (24%), and a late MI occurred in one patient (3%). At 6 months' follow-up of 56 survivors with unsuccessful management (development of MI or need for emergency bypass surgery), recurrent angina occurred in nine patients (16%), and cardiac death in two patients (4%). However, the majority of patients in both groups were either symptom free or had mild angina pectoris. CONCLUSION. Acute coronary artery occlusion during PTCA is often unpredictable, but its frequency is higher in patients with unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. Despite immediate redilatation, use of intracoronary streptokinase, and emergency bypass surgery, PTCA is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. 
1	Combination therapy for anaplastic giant cell thyroid carcinoma. Since 1981, 20 patients with anaplastic giant cell carcinoma of the thyroid have been prospectively treated according to a combination regimen of chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. Two types of chemotherapy were used every 4 weeks, depending on the patient's age. For those younger than 65 years, a combination of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2) was given, and for older patients mitoxantrone (14 mg/m2) was used. Radiotherapy was carried out between Day 10 and Day 20 of the first four cycles of chemotherapy. It delivered 17.5 Gy in 7 fractions to the neck and the superior mediastinum. Survival exceeding 20 months was observed in three patients. Complete neck tumor response was observed in five patients, among whom four had undergone previous operations. No response was seen in distant metastases, which were the cause of death in 14 patients. These treatment modalities are effective in some patients, both in terms of survival and of local control, avoiding death from local invasion. Gross tumor resection should be performed whenever possible but should not delay the commencement of this protocol. Toxicity was high and remains the main limiting factor. 
4	End diastolic flow velocity just beneath the aortic isthmus assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography: a new predictor of the aortic regurgitant fraction. End diastolic flow velocity just beneath the aortic isthmus was measured within 72 hours of cardiac catheterisation by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 30 controls and 61 patients with aortic regurgitation. The end diastolic flow velocity was determined at the peak R wave on a simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram. In all controls there was no reverse flow at the end diastole beneath the aortic isthmus. In patients with aortic regurgitation the end diastolic flow velocity correlated well with the angiographic grade of regurgitation (r = 0.81) and regurgitant fraction (r = 0.82). The mean (SD) values were 6.3 (5.2), 12.2 (4.3), 22.1 (5.7), and 34.3 (9.3) cm/s for patients with regurgitant fraction of less than 20%, between 20% and 40%, between 41% and 60%, and greater than 60%, respectively. An end diastolic flow velocity of greater than 18 cm/s predicted a regurgitant fraction of greater than or equal to 40% with a sensitivity of 88.5% and a specificity of 96%. The study suggests that the pulsed Doppler derived end diastolic flow velocity is a useful index in the routine non-invasive assessment of the severity of aortic regurgitation. 
5	Balloon dilatation versus surgical revision of infra-inguinal autogenous vein graft stenoses: long-term follow-up. Although infra-inguinal autogenous vein graft stenoses may be treated by balloon dilatation (PTA) or surgical revision, the optimal approach is undefined. Over the last 7 years 24 PTA procedures were performed on 37 vein graft stenoses in 19 grafts. Graft stenoses were diagnosed from 2 to 72 (mean = 17.3) months after implantation. PTA was successfully completed in 23 (96%) of the 24 procedures including 18 (95%) of the primary, and 5 (100%) of the secondary procedures. Recurrent vein graft stenosis or graft thrombosis developed in 12 (67%) grafts from 3 to 47 (mean = 12.5) months after primary PTA. Long-term patency after primary PTA was 69% at 6, 29% at 12, and 22% at 36 months; secondary patency was 81% at 6, 45% at 12, and 27% at 36 months. During the same period vein graft stenosis in 7 fem-pop and 2 fem-tib grafts were surgically revised with an initial success rate of 100%, and 2 (22%) complications. Four (44%) of these grafts occluded from 1-17 (mean 6.2) months after repair, yielding a primary 5-year patency of 62%. Although vein graft stenosis may be safely, effectively, and repeatedly treated with PTA, long-term durability appears to be superior after surgical revision. 
3	Normeperidine-induced seizures in hereditary coproporphyria. Seizures are common in acute exacerbations of hepatic porphyria, even though the etiology is not identified in most cases. We have reported a case of normeperidine-induced seizures in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria. Although meperidine is commonly used for pain control during acute attacks in these patients, this report suggests that meperidine is not a good analgesic choice in porphyria. Normeperidine-induced seizures in patients with porphyria may be treated by withdrawal of meperidine therapy and selective use of anticonvulsants. 
3	Adjuvant chemotherapy for primary lymphoma of the central nervous system. Ten immunocompetent patients with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system were treated by the neuro-oncology service at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF). After undergoing surgery for biopsy or removal of their tumors, these patients (group 1) received irradiation with hydroxyurea followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU), and vincristine. The outcome of treatment in this group was compared with that in three other groups of patients with primary CNS lymphoma: patients treated at the UCSF Cancer Research Institute who underwent surgery and radiation therapy (RT) (group 2); patients described in the literature who had surgery and RT (group 3); or patients described in the literature who had surgery, RT, and chemotherapy (group 4). Median and quartile survival times were greater in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 1, 30 and 50 months; group 4, 20 and 25 months) than in patients who did not receive chemotherapy after RT (group 2, 13 and 20 months; group 3, 15 and 24 months). These results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy is useful in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma. 
1	Segregation analysis of breast cancer from the cancer and steroid hormone study: histologic subtypes The segregation pattern of breast cancer in white families from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study was investigated. Families were categorized into four groups based on the histologic type of breast cancer in the probands:ductal cancer, lobular cancer, adenocarcinoma, and medullary cancer. The ductal cancer sample was further split into a premenopausal-proband and a postmenopausal-proband subset. Results for six complex segregation analyses are presented; the findings suggest heterogeneity in the transmission of breast cancer. For all analyses, there was no evidence for a multifactorial component in the mixed model, ie, a major locus plus other transmission, genetic and/or cultural. Interpretation of the medullary cancer, adenocarcinoma, and lobular cancer analyses does not permit discrimination among the major locus models. Segregation of breast cancer in the entire ductal sample was consistent with autosomal recessive transmission. In the ductal subanalyses, a recessive gene was sufficient to explain the breast cancer distribution when the proband had postmenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, when the proband had premenopausal breast cancer, the transmission model was consistent with a dominant major gene, with sporadic cases of disease. 
1	New type of Bcr/Abl junction in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. A new and rare type of Bcr/Abl junction between exon C3 of the 3' portion of the Bcr gene and Abl exon 2 has been identified in the leukemic cells of two Ph1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in chronic phase. This is the fourth type of Bcr/Abl junction so far identified in Ph1-positive hematologic malignancies and is a consequence of an unusual breakpoint position on chromosome 22 that falls approximately 20 kb downstream of the major breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the Bcr gene. The new hybrid mRNA is 540 base pairs (bp) longer than that expressed by the K562 cell line and could codify for a Bcr/Abl protein carrying 180 additional aminoacids with respect to the larger P210 protein so far identified. The hematologic phenotype expressed by the two patients carrying this unusual type of Bcr/Abl rearrangement does not significantly differ from that commonly seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia. 
1	Diagnostic value of brush cytology in the diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma: a study in 65 patients with bile duct strictures. Malignant strictures of the extrahepatic bile ducts are difficult to distinguish from benign strictures, particularly in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma. Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period. Each had at least one brushing. Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures. Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy. Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings. Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells. Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing. In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found. However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing. A single negative or suspicious cytological finding decreased the probability of bile duct carcinoma to 43%. Two and three sequential negative tests reduced the probability to 32% and 0%, respectively. 
1	A randomized control trial of two cervical spatulas The sampling efficacy of the Ayre and Rocket cervical spatulas was compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 533 women who were attending a colposcopy clinic either for investigation of cytological abnormality or for review after treatment of CIN. Smears were compared with respect to the presence of cytological abnormality and two types of normal cervical epithelial cells (endocervical and immature metaplastic cells) which are considered indicators of adequate cytological sampling. Smears taken with the Rocket spatula were significantly less likely to contain immature metaplastic cells (95% CI on difference in proportion; 5-30%), but more likely to contain endocervical cells (95% CI 16-36%). No significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. It is concluded that the Rocket spatula offered no advantage when used in these circumstances. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint. 
5	Persistent hepatitis B virus following interferon alfa therapy and liver transplantation. A 44-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and cirrhosis was treated with recombinant human interferon alfa for 67 days immediately before orthotopic liver transplantation and immunoprophylaxis with hyperimmune globulin to hepatitis B virus in the peritransplant period. Dot blots for hepatitis B virus DNA demonstrated marked reduction in viremia after 41 days of interferon alfa treatment. Southern analysis for hepatitis B virus in liver showed a pronounced decrement in actively replicating forms in the explant, although hepatic infection was still detectable. After liver transplantation, tests for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen remained negative. The patient died 32 days after transplantation of causes unrelated to hepatitis B virus. DNA isolated from liver and other visceral organs at autopsy showed infection of the engrafted liver and the persistence of monomeric relaxed circular forms of hepatitis B virus DNA in pancreas, kidney, and spleen. Thus, graft reinfection occurred despite aggressive antiviral therapy and immunoprophylaxis combined with liver transplantation. Existing viral serological markers appear insufficiently sensitive to assess residual infectivity. 
1	Long-term vascular access via the inferior vena cava. A prospective evaluation of long-term venous access catheters placed via the inferior vena cava was performed to determine their efficacy as well as short- and long-term morbidity. From June 1987 to May 1989, 31 catheters were placed in 26 patients, for a total of 3,503 catheter use days. All catheters were placed via an infraumbilical approach when the more conventional supraumbilical route was technically difficult, dangerous, or impossible to be used. There were a total of 14 complications in 12 episodes (one in every 701 catheter use days), six episodes of catheter occlusion or vessel thrombosis (one in every 583 catheter use days), one catheter malfunction, one episode of cuff erosion through the skin, and one catheter that migrated through the inferior vena cava into the retroperitoneum. These results compared favorably with our experience with long-term catheters of a similar type placed via a supraumbilical approach into the superior vena cava. We conclude that the infraumbilical route for long-term central venous access is safe and technically easy and should be strongly considered in patients in whom venous access via the supraumbilical approach will be technically difficult or have a high likelihood of failure. 
5	Reduction of gastric ulcer recurrence after suppression of Helicobacter pylori by cefixime. The effect on the recurrence of gastric ulcers after suppression of Helicobacter pylori by combined treatment with cimetidine and the antimicrobial drug cefixime was investigated. Twenty one of 43 patients with endoscopically proved gastric ulcer and H pylori infection were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine 800 mg daily for 12 weeks; the remaining 22 patients received cimetidine 800 mg daily for 12 weeks plus cefixime 100 mg daily for the last two weeks. After treatment, 88% of 17 patients on cimetidine only remained H pylori positive, whereas combined administration of cimetidine and cefixime had suppressed H pylori in 78% of 18 patients (p less than 0.05). Seventeen patients in the former group whose ulcers healed but who remained H pylori positive and 18 patients in the latter group whose ulcers healed and who were no longer infected with H pylori continued to be followed after treatment. These patients underwent endoscopy to detect ulcer recurrence if symptomatic, or at 12 and 24 weeks if asymptomatic. At 12 weeks, recurrence was observed in seven of 15 (47%) patients in whom H pylori persisted, but in only one of 14 (7%) patients in whom H pylori had been suppressed (p less than 0.05). At 24 weeks, however, recurrence rates were similar between the two groups. These findings indicate that H pylori infection may be closely related to early ulcer recurrence. 
5	Incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a prospective study. To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg. 
1	Wound healing complications in soft tissue sarcoma management: comparison of three treatment protocols. A prospective, nonrandomized comparison of three treatment protocols was undertaken in 45 patients with soft tissue sarcoma designated preoperatively as being at high risk of wound healing complications. All patients underwent complete resection of the gross tumour mass (5 with positive and 40 with negative microscopic margins). Fourteen patients received postoperative adjuvant irradiation (group I), 16 preoperative irradiation (group II), and 15 preoperative irradiation and vascularized tissue transfer to the surgical bed after resection (group III). Major wound healing complications (defined as complications requiring at least 1 further surgical procedure) were lower in group III patients (chi-square = 5.57, P less than 0.03), as was the mean postoperative hospital stay (P less than 0.02, analysis of variance), and the mean number of secondary surgical procedures. Multivariate analysis showed that the only variable influencing length of stay was the use of tissue transfer. Careful intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of resection is essential prior to performing vascularized tissue transfer to ensure that tumour contamination of the donor site is avoided. Since this study is a nonrandomized clinical trial using sequential distribution of patients to the treatment groups, the data should be considered as preliminary, rather than definitive, evidence of the efficacy of vascularized tissue transfer. 
4	Coronary artery disease in Chinese males without hypercholesterolaemia The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of various metabolic risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) in 246 male patients studied over a 2-year period. CAD was diagnosed on the basis of a history indicative of angina pectoris, an electrocardiogram diagnostic of myocardial ischaemia, and a positive coronary angiogram. Thirty-eight per cent of this population had diabetes, hypertension or both. Of the remaining individuals, 39% had a plasma cholesterol concentration greater than 5.2 mmol l-1, whereas 23% had a cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels of a non-smoking subset of those subjects with a total cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1 were compared with values of a matched group of individuals who did not have significant vessel disease as revealed by angiography. The results of these investigations indicated that patients with CAD and a plasma cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1 exhibited an increase in plasma triglyceride concentration and a decrease in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. Since these subjects were not diabetic, hypertensive or hypercholesterolaemic, it is suggested that the observed changes in triglyceride and HDL metabolism made a major contribution to the CAD in these individuals. 
4	Oxygen supply and utilization relationships. A reevaluation. The relationship between oxygen transport (TO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) has been studied in patients with a number of acute and chronic disorders. Many of these patients have been shown to have a linear relationship between these two variables over a wide range of TO2, which has been considered as evidence of pathologic supply dependency. This supply dependency contrasts with animal studies that have clearly demonstrated a biphasic relationship between TO2 and VO2. This review of the available data concerning the relationship between oxygen transport and supply under conditions of increased oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen transport suggests the possibility that the observed interaction in patients may, in many cases, represent the normal physiologic behavior of the system rather than an abnormal manifestation of impaired oxygen extraction. 
1	Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma: a review of 172 Japanese cases. The spontaneous rupture of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 10% mortality of HCC patients in Japan. Because this problem occurs much less frequently in western countries, it is often difficult for clinicians practicing in such countries to decide upon the best course of action during the crisis accompanying the spontaneous rupture of a HCC. In an effort to advance the general knowledge of this disease and clarify a selection for its treatment, we review 172 cases of spontaneous rupture of a HCC reported in the Japanese literature. The chief complaint of the patients was sudden epigastralgia or right hypochondriac pain. Abdominal paracentesis was positive in 86% of the patients. Liver failure was the cause of death in 42% of the patients. Therefore, it is important to evaluate liver reserve quickly. In addition, emergency hemostatic procedures must be implemented to avoid hemorrhagic shock. Although two-stage hepatectomy was performed in only 12% of the cases, these had the highest survival rates. Consequently, this is the procedure of choice for the treatment of spontaneous rupture of a HCC. 
4	Intraoperative peripheral Nd:YAG laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty: short-term and intermediate-term follow-up. Laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty was performed in 48 arteries (iliac, superficial femoral, and popliteal). Indications for surgery were limb salvage (25%), rest pain (38%), and claudication (38%). Patients were categorized into three groups: lesions less than 5 cm, greater than 5 to 10 cm, or greater than 10 cm in length. Demographic characteristics, risk factors, and outcome measures were compared by use of Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. The time for vascular patency failure was compared by use of a standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the three groups. Initial failure to recanalize was noted in 14% in lesions less than 5 cm, 40% in lesions greater than 5 to 10 cm, and 73% in lesions greater than 10 cm. The overall success rate was 38%, with a mean follow up of 1 year. The less than 5 cm lesion group had a significantly higher rate of overall success (59%, p = 0.005) than the other two groups combined. The greater than 10 cm lesion group did significantly worse (9%) than the other two groups combined (p = 0.028). Patients in the less than 5 cm group had significantly longer patency than the other two groups (p less than 0.01). Iliac lesions had a higher overall success rate (73%) than superficial femoral and popliteal artery lesions (35%) (p = 0.038). In conclusion, the widespread application of laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty cannot be justified without further long-term clinical and laboratory investigation. Conversely, the potential of this technique should not be dismissed out of hand. Proper patient selection, length and nature of the lesion to be treated, and the appropriate forms, doses, and method of delivery of laser energy, remain to be defined. 
4	Sudden death during empiric amiodarone therapy in symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Amiodarone is reported to improve symptoms and to prevent sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Amiodarone treatment (loading dose 30 g given over 6 weeks; maintenance dose 400 mg/day) was prospectively evaluated in 50 patients with HC in whom the drug was initiated because of symptoms refractory to conventional drug therapy (calcium antagonists and beta blockers). Twenty-one (42%) patients had ventricular tachycardia (VT) during Holter monitoring. Amiodarone significantly and often markedly improved the patients' New York Heart Association functional class status (from 3.3 to 2.7 at 2 months, p less than 0.001) and treadmill exercise duration (p less than 0.001). Eight patients, however, died (7 suddenly) during a mean follow-up period of 2.2 +/- 1.8 years. Of the 7 sudden deaths, 6 occurred within 5 months of initiation of treatment. The 6-month and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 87, 85 and 80%, respectively. The survival rate of patients with VT was significantly worse than that of patients without VT (61 vs 97% at 2 years; p less than 0.01). Sudden death occurred despite abolition of VT on Holter monitoring. Amiodarone increased left ventricular peak filling rate by radionuclide angiography in 20 of 33 patients (61%) (p less than 0.01). Decrease in peak left ventricular filling rate within 10 days of amiodarone therapy (8 of 33 patients) was associated with subsequent sudden death (p less than 0.04). 
3	The functional anatomy of motor recovery after stroke in humans: a study with positron emission tomography. We have studied regional cerebral blood flow changes in 6 patients after their recovery from a first hemiplegic stroke. All had a single well-defined hemispheric lesion and at least a brachial monoparesis that subsequently recovered. Each patient had 6 measurements of cerebral blood flow by positron tomography with 2 scans at rest, 2 during movement of fingers of the recovered hand, and 2 during movement of fingers of the normal hand. When the normal fingers were moved, regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. When the fingers of the recovered hand were moved, significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were observed in both contralateral and ipsilateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in both cerebellar hemispheres. Other regions, namely, insula, inferior parietal, and premotor cortex, were also bilaterally activated with movement of the recovered hand. We have also demonstrated, by using a new technique of image analysis, different functional connections between the thalamic nuclei and specific cortical and cerebellar regions during these movements. Our results suggest that ipsilateral motor pathways may play a role in the recovery of motor function after ischemic stroke. 
5	L-tryptophan implicated in human eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome causes fasciitis and perimyositis in the Lewis rat. Tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (L-TRP-EMS) is a newly described syndrome which occurred in epidemic fashion in the United States in the summer and fall of 1989. Epidemiologic data has linked the syndrome to intake of L-tryptophan (L-TRP) from one specific manufacturer, but the precise etiologic compound(s) must be established by replication of the syndrome in an appropriate animal model. In this study, implicated L-TRP, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade L-TRP, or vehicle was administered by gavage in a blinded fashion for 38 d to female Lewis rats at doses comparable with those ingested by patients who developed the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Animals receiving implicated L-TRP, but not those receiving USP grade L-TRP or vehicle, developed histologic signs consistent with fasciitis and perimyositis, specific pathologic features of human L-TRP-EMS. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was not observed. Hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone mRNA levels were lower and plasma corticosterone levels tended to be lower in the animals that received implicated L-TRP. Plasma L-kynurenine was higher in both L-TRP-treated groups compared to the vehicle-treated animals. The female Lewis rat is known to be susceptible to a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Identification of specific inflammatory changes in this rat following exposure to implicated L-TRP indicates that this animal model will be important in subsequent investigations into the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of human L-TRP-EMS. 
2	Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells. Mesothelioma has not been commonly reported as a cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. We have studied a patient with malignant mesothelioma and hypercalcemia in association with elevated plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP). Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor and seven of eight other mesotheliomas that were not associated with hypercalcemia revealed the presence of PLP cytoplasmic immunopositivity. PLP immunopositivity was also detected in normal and reactive mesothelial cells. The results of these studies suggest that PLP immunoreactivity is common in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells and raises the possibility that PLP production may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with mesothelioma. 
4	Hemodynamic efficacy of rapid saline infusion and dobutamine versus saline infusion alone in a model of cardiac rupture. Despite recent reports describing survival after cardiac rupture, the effectiveness of circulatory support while awaiting definitive surgical treatment is controversial. To assess the efficacy of volume expansion and pharmacologic support in cardiac tamponade due to cardiac rupture, a model of hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade was developed and treatment with rapid saline infusion and dobutamine was compared with rapid saline infusion alone in 15 closed chest dogs. A right ventricular wound of reproducible size was produced by deflating an aortic valvuloplasty balloon that had previously been passed by way of the internal jugular vein into the pericardial space and through a stab wound in the right ventricular free wall. Hemodynamic values were compared at baseline, during tamponade and after a rapid infusion (1 liter at 100 ml/min) of either saline solution alone or saline solution plus dobutamine (20 micrograms/kg per min). Atrial and pericardial pressures increased significantly in both groups. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume increased with combined saline and dobutamine infusion to values similar to those at baseline (91 +/- 19%, 114 +/- 43% and 94 +/- 37% of baseline, respectively). In contrast, saline infusion alone caused a small increase in cardiac output but failed to significantly increase mean arterial pressure or stroke volume (76.8 +/- 14.2%, 55 +/- 18% and 51 +/- 17% of baseline, respectively). Combined rapid infusion of saline solution and dobutamine infusion has a more beneficial hemodynamic effect and may be more effective than rapid saline infusion alone in resuscitating patients with hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade due to cardiac rupture. 
5	Haemorrhagic shock encephalopathy and sudden infant death In 2 pairs of non-identical twins, haemorrhagic-shock encephalopathy syndrome developed in 1 co-twin while the other died of sudden infant death syndrome. The twin pairs were aged 3 and 4 months, respectively, and no cause was identified. We suggest that stress protein deficiency may underlie both syndromes. 
5	Accidental poisoning with a superwarfarin compound (brodifacoum) in a child. The "superwarfarin" compounds are 4-hydroxy derivatives of coumarin that have increased activity and a longer duration of action than the parent compound. The superwarfarins are used widely in the United States as rodenticides and are effective against warfarin-resistant strains of rats. A chronic accidental ingestion of one of these products, brodifacoum, by a 7-year-old child who had bleeding and laboratory evidence suggestive of a vitamin K-related coagulopathy is reported. The bleeding manifestations were severe and prolonged, requiring 13 months for normalization of coagulation times. With a negative history of ingestion and despite clinical suspicion, documentation of superwarfarin poisoning was hampered by the lack of readily available assays for these compounds, even from the manufacturers. Brodifacoum was also identified in rat feces from the family home. This finding raises the concern of poisoning not only from ingestion of brodifacoum particles themselves, but also from a fecal-oral route. A review of the literature is presented and the implications of this case for the practicing physician are discussed. 
5	The management of retinal detachments associated with choroidal colobomas by vitreous surgery. We used vitreous surgery to treat seven patients (eight eyes) with complicated retinal detachments associated with choroidal colobomas. All eyes had large choroidal colobomas and no evidence of peripheral retinal breaks. Small, atrophic breaks were detected in five of the eyes and were located in the base of the coloboma in four of the five eyes. Adjunctive surgical techniques were necessary and included cyanoacrylate retinopexy in four eyes, silicone oil tamponade in five eyes, and retinectomy in two eyes. Retinal reattachment was ultimately attained in seven of the eight eyes. The number of surgical procedures ranged from one to five, with an average of three. Postoperative visual acuity of the eyes that underwent anatomically successful procedures ranged from 20/100 to light perception. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy was the most frequent cause of redetachment, occurring in six of the eight eyes. 
1	Growth and spread of hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of 240 consecutive autopsy cases. All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors. It appears that not only primary tumor size but also its macroscopic type has an important influence on the growth and spread of HCC. 
4	Estimation of Reynolds stresses within the Penn State left ventricular assist device. Fluid velocities were measured using a two-component laser Doppler anemometery (LDA) system at 129 locations within a Plexiglas model of a 70 cm3 Penn State electric Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). The LVAD was driven by a pulsatile piston pump acting on an attached segmented polyurethane diaphragm. Bjork-Shiley tilting disc valves were used to provide unidirectional flow through the inlet and outlet ports. A seeded blood analog fluid, which matched the kinematic viscosity of blood at high shear rates and the refractive index of Plexiglas, was used to make the measurements. At each location, 250 instantaneous velocity realizations were collected at eight instances during the pump cycle. The maximum Reynolds shear and normal stresses were calculated for each pump cycle time and location after filtering the data. The results reveal that the highest Reynolds shear and normal stresses occur in the near wall region just proximal to the aortic valve during diastole, and reach values of 5,300 dynes/cm2 and 10,800 dynes/cm2, respectively. The elevated turbulent stresses are observed during the period of regurgitant flow through the aortic valve, with peak stress values arising during the period of peak regurgitant flow. This supports the hypothesis that a regurgitant turbulent jet is formed near the wall of the prosthetic aortic valve and may be contributing to blood damage. 
2	A hepatocellular carcinoma of massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain treated with CDDP two-route chemotherapy--a case report. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor vessels or tumor stain are sometimes encountered in advanced cases of liver cirrhosis. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain that responded well to intensive chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II are reported. 
5	Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia: role in hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the cause and clinical course of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, and coronary heart disease. This article summarizes the evidence in support of this general hypothesis. 
3	Protecting the vasculature: an eye toward the future. Although calcium antagonists were originally developed for use in the management of patients with angina pectoris, they are now used in the management of other cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. More recently, the calcium antagonists have been under investigation for their potential protective role in atherosclerosis. Coupled with these new possibilities for therapeutic use are the development of new, long-acting, tissue-specific calcium antagonists. Amlodipine belongs to this group, and although it is a dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist, its pharmacologic profile differs from that of other dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonists. Differences include: different pH optimum for receptor binding, different rates of association and dissociation, and differences in allosteric interaction with the diltiazem and verapamil binding sites. Amlodipine, when given orally to rabbits receiving a high-cholesterol diet, reduces atheroma formation. Evidence of its ability to protect the vasculature is provided by its ability to significantly increase (p less than 0.001) survival in stroke-prone hypertensive rats. 
4	Arrhythmias in patients with CHF. Should they be treated? Ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of death in patients with congestive heart failure. Dr Ellenbogen and his associates discuss the current thinking, based on recent studies, concerning use of antiarrhythmic agents to prevent sudden cardiac death in these patients. As they point out, the proper antiarrhythmic therapy may be crucial to long-term survival. 
1	Consistent involvement of the bcr gene by 9;22 breakpoints in pediatric acute leukemias. To investigate the relationship of bcr-abl fusion mRNAs with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we examined 27 pediatric Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive acute leukemias using a reverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. In cells from 24 leukemias, single bcr-abl PCR products were detected that corresponded to breakpoints in the minor breakpoint cluster region (mbcr in intron 1 of the bcr gene) associated with production of the P190 fusion protein. Cells from the three remaining leukemias contained breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) as shown by PCR and Southern blot analyses. These three leukemias also contained low levels of the mbcr PCR product that may have resulted from alternative splicing of the bcr-abl precursor RNA. A screen of 35 additional leukemias from patients who failed therapy before day 180 (induction failures or early relapses) found one case with unsuccessful cytogenetics to express Mbcr-abl RNA. All four children with Mbcr breakpoints had white blood cell levels in excess of 250,000 at presentation (compared with 2 of 24 with mbcr breakpoints) and two had hematologic and clinical features suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis. Our results indicate that in Ph1-positive pediatric leukemias, all 9;22 breakpoints occur in one of the two known breakpoint cluster regions in the bcr gene on chromosome 22. The reverse PCR reliably detected all patients with cytogenetic t(9;22) and is capable of detecting additional Ph1-positive leukemias that are missed by standard cytogenetics. Furthermore, the Mbcr-type breakpoint, associated with production of p210, can be seen in childhood leukemias presenting either as clinical ALL or as apparent lymphoid blast crisis of CML, suggesting that t(9;22) breakpoint locations do not exclusively determine the biologic and clinical features of pediatric Ph1-positive ALL. 
4	Effect of antihypertensives on sexual function and quality of life: the TAIM Study OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment of mild hypertension using combinations of diet and low-dose pharmacologic therapies. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Three university-based tertiary care centers. PATIENTS: Patients (697) 21 to 65 years of age with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg as well as weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight. INTERVENTION: Patients were stratified by clinical center and race and were randomly assigned to one of three diets (usual, low-sodium and high-potassium, weight loss) and one of three agents (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol). MEASUREMENTS: Changes in measures of sexual problems, distress, and well-being after 6 months of therapy were analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: Low-dose chlorthalidone and atenolol produced few side effects, except in men. Erection-related problems worsened in 28% (95% CI, 15% to 41%) of men receiving chlorthalidone and usual diet compared with 3% (CI, 0% to 9%) of those receiving placebo and usual diet (P = 0.009) and 11% (CI, 2% to 20%) of those receiving atenolol and usual diet (P greater than 0.05). The weight loss diet ameliorated this effect. The low-sodium diet with placebo was associated with greater fatigue (34%; CI, 23% to 45%) than was either usual diet (18%; CI, 10% to 27%; P = 0.04) or weight reduction (15%; CI, 7% to 23%; P = 0.009). The low-sodium diet with chlorthalidone increased problems with sleep (32%; CI, 22% to 42%) compared with chlorthalidone and usual diet (16%; CI, 8% to 24%; P = 0.04). The weight loss diet benefited quality of life most, reducing total physical complaints (P less than 0.001) and increasing satisfaction with health (P less than 0.001). Total physical complaints decreased in 57% to 76% of patients depending on drug and diet group, and were markedly decreased by weight loss. CONCLUSION: In general, low-dose antihypertensive drug therapy (with chlorthalidone or atenolol) improves rather than impairs the quality of life; however, chlorthalidone with usual diet increases sexual problems in men. 
5	Colonic lipoma as a source of massive hemorrhage. Report of a case. Colonic lipomas are a rare source of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding requiring operative intervention. A case of massive hemorrhage from cecal lipomatosis is presented. The methods of preoperative diagnosis and treatment are discussed. 
2	Surgical results of intrathoracic gastric volvulus complicating hiatal hernia. From 1981 to 1988, 138 patients with hiatal hernia were treated surgically at our centre. Twenty-one (mean age 76.6 years, 17 women, four men) had an associated intrathoracic gastric volvulus. Eleven patients (mean age 73.2 years), of whom eight were asymptomatic, had an elective procedure. Ten patients (mean age 80.3 years) had emergency surgery, six for acute complications of the volvulus (five cases of strangulation and one of perforated ulcer) and four because of other, unrelated causes of acute abdomen. There were four deaths after operation, all in the emergency surgery group. Four other patients had significant morbidity, all in the emergency group. In the elective cases, all hernias were easily reduced. In one emergency case a gastrotomy was necessary for decompression, and in another gastrectomy was necessary because of gastric gangrene. Our results indicate the need for elective intervention when intrathoracic gastric volvulus is first diagnosed. 
5	Roles of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the mechanism of halothane myocardial sensitization in dogs. The authors investigated the comparative roles of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in myocardial sensitization by halothane in dogs. The arrhythmogenic dose (AD) of isoproterenol was determined in the presence of various doses of phenylephrine during halothane anesthesia in dogs, and the influences of 1-metoprolol (beta 1-antagonist) and ICI-118,551 (beta 2-antagonist) on the AD were examined. In the presence of 1-metoprolol, the AD of isoproterenol was significantly greater than the control, but in the presence of ICI-118,551, the AD of isoproterenol was lower. Blood pressure during the arrhythmias was higher in the presence of ICI-118,551 than that in controls. In addition, the AD of ritodrine (beta 2-agonist) was also determined at various doses of phenylephrine. The interaction between phenylephrine and ritodrine in inducing arrhythmias showed hyperbolic isoboles. However, 1-metoprolol completely inhibited the occurrence of arrhythmias induced by ritodrine and phenylephrine. The results suggest that myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors play an essential role in the genesis of arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia in dogs, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptors do not. 
5	The role of a critical care unit in an epidemic. The role of a critical care unit in life-threatening situations is well established. The management of 52 children with acute gastroenteritis and 22 children with acute paralytic poliomyelitis as part of recent epidemics is described. The solutions to the problems in the critical care management of these 74 victims (out of a total of 6197 patients admitted during the epidemics) are discussed. 
4	Strokes in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Stroke in Asian and Pacific-Islander populations remains the principal cause of death among adults, but its incidence in the United States approximates that of Caucasians. Although controversial, uncontrolled hypertension in certain population groups (e.g., northern Japanese) and high dietary saturated fat in others (e.g, Pacific-Islanders) are believed to be responsible for the high stroke incidence rates. The recent reduction in stroke frequency rates in these areas is thought to be the result of better hypertension control. In the Ni-Hon-San Study, the level of hypertension and its frequency were similar in Hawaii and Japan, but ischemic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were less frequent in Hawaii. Reduced meat and fat intake may contribute to small vessel disease in Japan. Stroke is the third major cause of death among Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans, yet there is a paucity of information, especially about stroke, in subgroups of these populations. There is also considerable ignorance and controversy about risk factors for stroke in these populations. The need for additional research is urgent. 
4	Sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension. Between 1953 and 1988, 21 patients with splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), 12 of whom had sinistral portal hypertension (SPH) were treated at our institution. SVT was identified at autopsy in nine patients. Twelve additional patients presented with SPH: bleeding esophageal varices, SVT and normal hepatic function. SVT was caused by pancreatic neoplasm (5), chronic pancreatitis (5), and pancreatic pseudocyst (2). SVT was diagnosed by splanchnic angiography, splenoportography, computerized tomography, and ultrasonography. Gastric varices were diagnosed by endoscopy (10) and barium swallow (2). Splenectomy was performed as primary therapy in 10 patients. Three of these 10 had en block distal pancreatectomy. Two high-risk patients had splenic artery embolization, one as a prelude to splenectomy performed 48 hours later and the other as definitive therapy. One splenectomized patient continued to bleed. No further bleeding occurred in 10 splenectomized patients in follow-up from 1 week to 14 years. Sinistral portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome of splenic vein thrombosis caused by pancreatic pathology and manifests as bleeding gastric varices in patients with a patent portal vein and normal hepatic function. Splanchnic arteriography is necessary for accurate diagnosis. Splenectomy is the effective treatment of choice. 
5	Sequential connection of flaps: a logical approach to customized mandibular reconstruction. Microsurgery has improved the success rate for reconstruction of composite defects in the head and neck. Restoration of mandibular continuity alone is not adequate for reconstruction. Replacement of the oral lining with thin tissue is necessary to improve tongue mobility and to set the stage for later dental restoration. There is currently no ideal osteocutaneous free flap that provides unlimited length of bone, can undergo multiple osteotomies to produce the proper curve to the reconstructed mandible, and provides thin skin for oral lining. Combining free flaps can take advantage of the strengths of the individual donor sites and eliminate some of the problems with current osteocutaneous flaps. In six patients, a fibular osseous free flap was combined with either a radial forearm flap or a lateral arm flap to provide bone and oral lining in reconstruction of mandibular composite defects. In these selected patients, the fibula provided the blood supply for the second free flap, which was placed sequentially. The distal peroneal vessels were used to anastomose to the radial forearm vessels or the lateral arm pedicle. This approach allows the surgeon to customize the defect by improving both the functional and aesthetic aspects of reconstruction and is of use in cases where vascular access is limited, such as following head and neck surgery and radiation. 
1	Topographic classification, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic delay of cancer of the larynx/hypopharynx in Torino, Italy. The case series of a population-based case-control study of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in Torino, Italy, included 281 men with clinical and anamnestic data. Two hundred fifteen, 28, and 38 cancers originated from the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx, respectively. Regions invaded by the tumor were divided into 26 subsites. A classification based on the number of invaded subsites was proposed, which agreed well with the T classification of the TNM system. Cancers originating from the hypopharynx invaded more subsites than cancers from the endolarynx, and among the latter, supraglottic were more invasive than glottic lesions. The number of invaded subsites was strongly associated with nodal involvement. Among symptoms at onset of disease and at diagnosis, patients with endolaryngeal lesions reported dysphonia and dyspnea more frequently, and patients with lesions from other regions had a higher prevalence of dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, and adenopathia. Clinical and epidemiologic results of this study suggest considering the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx as separate anatomic entities. Diagnostic delay was not associated with tumor size and showed a negative trend with involvement of cervical lymph nodes, suggesting that stage at diagnosis is due to intrinsic differences in tumor aggressiveness. 
1	Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Relation to Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and gastric acid secretion. Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. 
3	An early description of slowly progressive aphasia. Slowly progressive aphasia without generalized dementia has become an important issue of present-day neuropsychological research. Historically, credit for the first description is usually given to Pick. Another German-speaking author who has published a vivid description of a pertinent cases is Pick's contemporary, Max Rosenfeld. This author has also observed a patient with slowly progressive spatial disorientation and visual recognition deficit, and he has discussed these patients in a remarkably modern way in the context of partial atrophy of the brain. 
5	Differences in glycolytic capacity and hypoxia tolerance between hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. Viability, glycolytic capacity and energy metabolism under anaerobic conditions were studied in the hepatoma cell lines HTC, FU5 and HepG2 and in rat and human hepatocytes using glucose and fructose as glycolytic precursors. During 6 hr of anaerobic incubation without additional substrate, viability decreased rapidly in FU5 and HTC cells, whereas viability of HepG2 cells was not significantly affected. In all tumor cells, 10 mmol/L glucose prevented hypoxic cell injury almost completely. Lactate formation from glucose was about five times higher than in hepatocytes under these circumstances. ATP content of the tumor cells remained almost constant under anaerobic conditions in the presence of glucose. Ten millimoles per liter of fructose diminished glycolysis in the hepatoma cells compared with glucose, ranging from 87% reduction in HTC cells to 43% reduction in HepG2 cells. Accordingly, ATP content decreased rapidly in the FU5 and slowly in the HepG2 cells. Viability was strongly diminished in the HTC and FU5 cells in the presence of fructose, whereas in the HepG2 cells no effect of fructose on viability was detectable. In contrast to the hepatoma cells, rat and human hepatocytes exhibited higher rates of anaerobic glycolysis in the presence of fructose and thus were able to maintain their viability under these conditions. These differences in glycolytic capacity, energy metabolism and hypoxia tolerance of hepatoma cells compared with hepatocytes may be used for the treatment of liver cancer by isolated liver perfusion and ex situ revision of the organ. 
3	Deficiency of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease. Facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), an inherited neuromuscular disorder, is characterized by progressive wasting of specific muscle groups, particularly the proximal musculature of the upper limbs; the primary defect in this disorder is unknown. We studied a patient with FSHD to determine whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain was functionally abnormal. Muscle biopsy revealed fiber atrophy with patchy staining for oxidative enzymes. Electron microscopy of a liver section showed many enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions. Decreased oxidation of the respiratory substrates-alanine and succinate-in skin fibroblasts suggested a deficiency of complex III of the electron-transport chain; cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) was in the normal range. Biochemical analysis of liver supported the fibroblast data, since succinate oxidase activity (electron-transport activity through complexes II-IV) was reduced, whereas complex IV activity was normal. Furthermore, analysis of the cytochrome spectrum in liver revealed typical peaks for cytochromes cc1 and aa3, whereas cytochrome b (a component of complex III) was undetectable. Southern blot analysis of fibroblast mtDNA revealed no major deletions or rearrangements. Our study provides the first documentation of a specific enzyme-complex deficiency associated with FSHD. 
5	Use and misuse of oral therapy for diarrhea: comparison of US practices with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. To determine how closely US pediatricians follow the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition's recommendations on oral therapy for acute diarrhea, a questionnaire was administered to four groups: New England private practitioners, pediatricians from 27 states attending a postgraduate course, representatives of departments of pediatrics at US schools of medicine, and housestaff at Boston Children's and Massachusetts General hospitals. The responses from departments of pediatrics and housestaff were not significantly different from those of community practitioners in most categories. The reported rate of use of glucose-electrolyte solutions recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics was not different from the use of nonphysiologic, high-osmolar, low-salt solutions such as sodas and juices. The usage rate for glucose-electrolyte solutions meeting the American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended carbohydrate-to-sodium ratio of less than 2:1 was less than 30%. Other findings included the general lack of agreement on the use of a single type of therapy and the common use of oral therapy only for mild or no dehydration. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that feeding be reintroduced in the first 24 hours of a diarrheal episode, the majority of respondents withhold feeding until the second day or later. These findings indicate that educational programs on oral therapy during acute diarrhea are needed in the United States. 
1	Imaging of adult central nervous system primary malignant gliomas. Staging and follow-up. A classification and staging system for primary adult gliomas was proposed. This system uses the high signal intensity found on proton density or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scans at the site of the tumor and surrounding edema (including infiltrating tumor). 
5	Hyposensitivity to vasopressin in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis during acute variceal hemorrhage. It has been suggested that vasopressin given during hemorrhage may be less effective than when given during a stable state in a portal-hypertensive rat model. This study was designed to evaluate the hemodynamic response to vasopressin infusion in 25 HBsAg-positive cirrhotic patients. Nine patients had active variceal hemorrhage before vasopressin infusion, and the other 16 patients were in a stable condition at the time of infusion. The two groups of patients were similar in baseline values except that a higher heart rate was found in patients with hemorrhage (96 +/- 20 vs. 73 +/- 10 beats/min, mean +/- S.D., p less than 0.01). Thirty minutes after vasopressin infusion (0.66 units/min), hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly decreased in both bleeding and stable patients (from 21 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; and from 18 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, respectively). However, the decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient was less obvious in bleeding patients as compared with stable patients (4 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). A significant reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient after vasopressin infusion was found in five bleeding patients without shock (from a median of 16 mm Hg [range = 12 to 26] to 11 mm Hg [range = 6 to 18], p less than 0.05), but not in four bleeding patients with shock (from 28 [range = 15 to 36] to 25 [range = 18 to 33] mm Hg, p greater than 0.05). 
2	Toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside in the treatment of advanced childhood tumors resistant to conventional therapy. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. Experience with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HDAC) in pediatric solid tumors is limited. Sixteen children with solid tumors resistant to conventional therapies were registered in a pilot Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study that required the administration of HDAC at 3 g/m2 every 12 hours for four doses. There were four cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, two cases of fibrosarcoma, four cases of neuroblastoma, and one case each of germ cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, retinoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. All eligible patients had advanced diseases and had previously received extensive chemotherapy. Thirteen patients received one course of HDAC and three patients received two courses of HDAC. Due to prior treatments, patients had less than normal marrow reserves. Short-term toxicity included nausea, vomiting, suppression of hemopoiesis, drug fever, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. All evaluable patients recovered from their toxicities. There were no drug-related deaths. None of the patients had neurologic problems, including the only patient with prior irradiation to the skull. With the above schedule, HDAC appears to have manageable toxicity. 
1	An early phase II study of CPT-11: a new derivative of camptothecin, for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. An early phase II study of a new camptothecin analog and an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, CPT-11, was conducted in 62 patients with refractory leukemia and lymphoma by four different treatment schedules in a multiinstitutional cooperative study. CPT-11 therapy resulted in four complete remissions (CRs) and three partial remissions (PRs) in 29 assessable non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, one PR in three Hodgkin's disease (HD), one CR and one PR in 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and one PR in 15 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Single infusion of 200 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks produced no response in both leukemia and lymphoma patients. Sixty-minute infusions of 40 mg/m2/d for 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks or for 3 days weekly produced four CRs (17%) and four PRs (17%) in 24 patients with malignant lymphoma. Sixty-minute infusions of 20 mg/m2 twice a day for 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks resulted in one CR and two PRs in 12 patients with acute leukemia. No response was seen in an acute leukemia patient by another treatment schedule. CPT-11 was effective in two (15%) of 13 primarily refractory leukemia and lymphoma cases, in two of four relapsed cases, and in seven (17%) of 41 relapsed and refractory cases. Major side effects were leukopenia (91%) and gastrointestinal (GI) (76%). CPT-11 was shown to be effective against refractory leukemia and lymphoma, and thus deserves further clinical study; the novel antitumor activity mode of this drug predicts no cross-resistance to presently available antitumor drugs. 
4	Effects of occupied and unoccupied bed making on myocardial work in healthy subjects. Strict bed rest prescribed after acute myocardial infarction provides rest for the heart in an effort to lessen myocardial work. However, bed rest has been implicated as a threat to physical and psychosocial well-being. Nurses must question whether activities associated with bed rest, such as bed making by hospital personnel while the patient is occupying the bed, actually require less myocardial work than out-of-bed activities. In this study we examined cardiovascular function of 22 healthy individuals, 10 (45.5%) men and 12 (54.5%) women ranging in age from 34 to 69 years (mean 48 years), during occupied (side to side method) and unoccupied (patient up to chair) bed making. Cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and the ratio of preejection period to left ventricular ejection time were measured by using an impedance cardiograph and vital signs monitor. Although differences between these measurements during the two bed making procedures were statistically significant (p less than 0.001), they were not deemed clinically significant for healthy subjects because they represent transient reflexive responses to posturally induced changes in venous return rather than substantial increases in myocardial work. When the goal is minimal myocardial energy expenditure, making the bed when it is unoccupied may offer a sound alternative to making an occupied bed. 
3	A family study of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a familial disorder and that chronic tics (CT) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) appear to be etiologically related to the syndrome. In the present study we report the results from a study of 338 biological relatives of 86 TS probands, 21 biologically unrelated relatives of adopted TS probands, and 22 relatives of normal subjects. The 43 first-degree relatives of the adopted TS and normal probands constituted a control sample. The rates of TS, CT, and OCD in the total sample of biological relatives of TS probands were significantly greater than in the relatives of controls. In addition, the morbid risks of TS, OCD, and CT were not significantly different in families of probands with OCD when compared to relatives of probands without OCD. These findings provide further evidence that OCD is etiologically related to TS. 
5	One-stage repair of colovaginal fistula complicating acute diverticulitis. Fourteen patients with colovaginal fistula secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis were seen between 1964 and 1988. Thirteen had undergone prior hysterectomy. Three different operative approaches were used. Three patients were treated with colostomy alone; one died and the fistula persisted in one. Five patients underwent staged procedures. One patient died of complications after the second stage of a planned three-stage procedure. Four patients underwent a two-stage procedure (fistula takedown, colectomy with colostomy and colostomy closure), all with good results. Six patients were treated with one-stage fistula takedown, colectomy and primary anastomosis, without major complication. We advocate this as the procedure of choice and emphasize the following principles of epidemiology and management: 1) colovaginal fistula complicates diverticulitis in elderly women usually following hysterectomy; this association may be a factor in etiology; 2) vaginography is useful in diagnosis; and 3) planned one-stage repair is the best surgical approach. 
4	Role of prostanoids in renin-dependent and renin-independent hypertension. We investigated the role of prostanoid-mediated pressor mechanisms in setting the level of blood pressure in renin-dependent and renin-independent models of hypertension in unanesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of a blocker of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors, SQ29548 (2 mg/kg bolus injection plus 2 mg/kg/hr for 3 hours), reduced from 162 +/- 4 to 144 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 7-14 days after coarctation when plasma renin activity is greatly increased. In contrast, treatment with SQ29548 was without effect on the blood pressure of either normotensive or hypertensive rats (i.e., aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 90-113 days after coarctation, deoxycorticosterone-salt-induced hypertension) having normal or depressed values of plasma renin activity. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SQ29548 in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension was positively correlated with the prevailing plasma renin activity and could not be demonstrated in hypertensive rats pretreated with indomethacin. We attribute the hypotensive effect of SQ29548 to interference with pressor mechanisms that depend on activation of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors and suggest that such prostanoid-mediated mechanisms are operational and contribute to an increase in blood pressure in angiotensin-dependent forms of hypertension. Also prostanoid-mediated vasodepressor mechanisms are operational in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension since the blood pressure of rats pretreated with SQ29548 was increased by the subsequent administration of indomethacin. Accordingly, the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension is influenced by the interplay of prostanoid-mediated pressor and vasodepressor mechanisms. 
1	Pathologic features of sharp curettings in complete hydatidiform mole. Predictors of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. The medical records and pathologic specimens were reviewed from 33 patients with complete molar pregnancy at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1980 and 1989. Two pathologists (D.R.G. and R.W.R.) reviewed all slides from the original sharp curettage to identify pathologic features that may be associated with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). The pathologic features evaluated were implantation site, presence of myometrium, presence of villi, presence and degree of atypia in cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, presence of fibrinoid, presence of implantation site inflammatory cells, volume of tissue and area of trophoblastic tissue. Only one pathologic feature, fibrinoid deposits, identified in sharp curettings was associated with the development of persistent GTT. While 12 (48%) of 25 patients who attained remission without chemotherapy had fibrinoid deposits, only 1 (12.5%) of 8 patients who developed persistent GTT had them (P less than .10). 
5	Mechanisms controlling growth of hepatocytes in primary culture. Mature hepatocytes in primary culture express most of the functions and hormonal responsiveness seen in normal liver studied in vivo. The growth of hepatocytes in culture is regulated by various growth factors. We have identified a hepatocyte growth factor that is isolated from rat platelets. We found that rat platelets also contain a growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor-beta which is secreted as a latent molecule. Its latency is due to its binding with a masking protein. Growth of hepatocytes is also suppressed by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6. Moreover, the growth and functions of liver cells in culture are regulated reciprocally by cell density: at higher cell density liver-specific functions are expressed and growth is suppressed, whereas the opposite situation is observed at lower cell density. In contrast, neonatal hepatocytes in culture grow autonomously without a requirement for added hormones. This autonomous growth is due to an autocrine mechanism in which the cells secrete one or more growth factors into the culture medium. However, this autonomous growth ceases one week after birth at a time when the cells begin to express differentiated characteristics. Based upon these data, the mechanisms of liver regeneration, differentiation, and hepatocarcinogenesis are discussed. 
4	Thrombotic vasculopathy associated with cryofibrinogenemia. Cryofibrinogenemia refers to the presence of cold-precipitable plasma proteins associated with a variety of disorders, including malignancies, inflammatory processes, and thrombohemorrhagic phenomena. Few cases of essential or primary cryofibrinogenemia are reported. We report a case in a 48-year-old man of essential cryofibrinogenemia and hemorrhagic necrosis of the ears and of the upper and lower extremities. Histopathologic studies demonstrated extensive eosinophilic thrombi in the dermal vasculature, with minimal inflammation and no vasculitis. Cryofibrinogenemia should be considered in the investigation of patients with otherwise unexplained cold intolerance and dermal thrombosis associated with minimal or no inflammation. 
5	New isotopic technique for detecting prosthetic arterial graft infection: 99mTc-hexametazime-labelled leucocyte imaging. Early and accurate detection of prosthetic arterial graft infection is important because this serious complication of vascular surgery carries high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes the use of a new method of isotopic imaging to detect graft infection using 99mTc-hexametazime-labelled leucocytes. Seventeen patients with potentially infected arterial grafts were imaged in addition to routine investigations but were managed according to our normal surgical practice. 99mTc-imaging was positive in eight patients with proven graft infection and falsely positive in one patient with a groin haematoma (89 per cent specificity). There were no false negatives (100 per cent sensitivity) after an average follow-up of 6 months (range 3-9 months). This technique has proved a reliable and rapid method of confirming graft infection. 
2	Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. A case of small bowel phytobezoar formed from unusual ingested vegetation is described. The patient presented with recurrent subacute obstruction and a right iliac fossa mass mimicking the presentation of Crohn's disease. None of the usual gastrointestinal disorders that predispose to bezoar formation were present. The phytobezoar passed spontaneously following small bowel enema and colonoscopy. It is possible that relaxation of the gut secondary to the antispasmodics administered at investigation or the physical disturbance during these procedures enabled migration through the ileocecal valve. Antispasmodics may be of use in the conservative management of bezoars obstructing otherwise normal bowel. 
5	The prolonged burner syndrome. Over the course of a single football season, six players evaluated by the medical staff had burners that displayed a prolonged neurologic recovery. These players were examined and subsequently evaluated with isokinetic testing and electrodiagnostic studies to elucidate better the short-term natural history of the prolonged burner syndrome. Evidence of muscular weakness at 72 hours postinjury best correlated with positive electrodiagnostic findings. No correlation was found between the initial physical examination findings and the results of electrodiagnostic testing. Isokinetic strength evaluation demonstrated many relative strength differences that were difficult to discern with manual muscle testing. The return of a player to athletic competition following this injury should largely be based on the clinical examination. 
3	A limited diagnostic investigation for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Oximetry and static charge sensitive bed. A simplified sleep apnea investigation consisting of combined oximetry and respiration movement monitoring was compared with conventional polysomnography. These two types of recordings were performed simultaneously during one night in 77 patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). A static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) was used in the simplified recording because it provides a comfortable and reliable means of recording respiration movements. Periods of obstructive apneas gave a diamond-shaped periodic respiration movement pattern in the SCSB, usually accompanied by repetitive oxygen desaturations. The average number of desaturations greater than or equal to 4 percent per sleeping hour was termed the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and compared with the apnea index (AI). In the whole population they were well correlated (p less than 0.0001, R2 = 0.41), but in individual cases there were considerable discrepancies. Patients with periodic respiration movements less than 18 percent of total sleeping time and ODI less than 2 never had AI greater than or equal to 5, whereas patients with periodic respiration greater than 45 percent and ODI greater than 6 always had AI greater than or equal to 5. Fifty-one of the 77 patients fulfilled these criteria. A bradycardia response to apneas was absent in 29 percent of patients with AI greater than or equal to 5. A combination of respiration movement and oximetry recording thus seems to give sufficient information to confirm or negate a diagnosis of OSAS in a majority of patients with clinical symptoms. In borderline patients, further investigations should be performed. 
2	Adenocarcinoma of the appendiceal stump. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with nonspecific abdominal complaints in whom barium enema and subsequent colonoscopy showed a 3 cm lobulated adenocarcinoma within a villous adenoma arising from the appendiceal stump. Because such appendiceal malignancies have no specific clinical signs, symptoms, or radiologic features, preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult, and colonoscopy may be required to clarify radiologically demonstrated irregularities. 
5	Hospital setting and fetal death during labor among women at low risk. Intrapartum fetal death in low-risk women at term is a rare obstetric outcome. This is difficult to study because few data sets contain an adequate number of cases for meaningful analysis. This study used data from the 1980 National Natality Survey and National Fetal Mortality Survey, merged with an American Hospital Association annual survey for the same year, to determine whether the frequency of intrapartum fetal death in low-risk women varied by the hospital setting for birth. Stratified analysis was used to assess the relation of level of hospital for delivery with intrapartum fetal death, with control for potential confounding factors. As the level of available perinatal technology decreased, the frequency of intrapartum fetal death increased (odds ratio, 2.0 for Level II and 3.3 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). Even when early neonatal deaths were considered, perinatal mortality remained lowest at Level III facilities (odds ratio, 1.6 for Level II and 2.7 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). The components of intrapartum surveillance that are most effective in the reduction of perinatal mortality have not been identified. 
4	Tightening the screw: statutory and legal supervision of interhospital patient transfers. A federal statute governing the transfer of indigent patients from Medicare-enrolled hospitals was first enacted in 1986. Review of the statutory and other legal controls over interhospital transfers is precipitated by its recent amendment and the fining of a Texas physician for transferring a high-risk obstetric patient without following the statutory guidelines. These events are part of a pattern of increasing regulation of the practice of medicine. Physicians and hospital administrators responsible for hospital transfer policies should be aware of regulatory developments. Hospitals contemplating transfer of patients must develop transfer policies that comply with governing law, including state law. A transfer policy should provide guidelines as to when a patient is "stable for transfer". Patients may not be transferred unless a physician can certify that delay attendant to transfer will not be detrimental. Furthermore, the policy should specify the procedures to be followed to effect a transfer and any documentation that the physician will have to complete. 
4	Cerebral air embolism treated by pressure and hyperbaric oxygen. We used pressure and hyperbaric oxygen to treat 2 patients with cerebral air embolism, occurring as the result of invasive medical procedures, and neither suffered any permanent damage detectable by clinical examination and MRI. This outcome contrasts with reports of infarct and disability among untreated victims of air embolism. 
5	Ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis associated with sensorineural deafness Sensorineural deafness is rarely associated with both ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis. A patient is described in whom acute sensorineural deafness occurred in association with episcleritis, ulcerative colitis and clinical features suggesting giant cell arteritis. 
1	Deletion of the human retinoblastoma gene in primary leukemias. As an initial step in evaluating the role of tumor suppressor genes in leukemogenesis, we surveyed primary leukemia cells from 130 patients for possible deletion of the retinoblastoma susceptibility (Rb) gene by Southern blot analysis. Two of them clearly showed homozygous deletion of Rb alleles. The first patient was a pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) associated with a cytogenetic translocation: t(14;16)(q24;q22). The deletion was located at the 3' portion of the Rb gene, very close to the site of Rb gene deletion recently identified in an ALL cell line. The absence of Rb110 protein was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The second patient was a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), terminated in acute blastic transformation. Deletion of the 5' portion of Rb gene was found in leukemic cells in the chronic stage. The results indicated that inactivation of the Rb gene occurred in certain cases of leukemia. Its significance warrants further study. 
5	Tracheotomy in the first year of life. Much has been written concerning complications of pediatric tracheotomies, but few studies have reviewed the complication rates of tracheotomies performed in the first 12 months of life. We reviewed the records of 60 patients who underwent tracheotomy in the first year of life between 1976 and 1988. This study includes 30 full-term infants and 30 premature infants, 16 of whom were very low birth weight preterm infants (less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation and less than 1,500 g birth weight). Overall complication rates were 3% intraoperative, 13% early postoperative, and 38% late postoperative. The early postoperative complication rate in preterm infants was nearly double that of full-term infants. The late postoperative complication rate of patients undergoing tracheotomy for airway obstruction was more than double that of patients requiring tracheotomy for pulmonary indications. Duration of tracheotomy, however, was felt to be the most important factor in the development of a late postoperative complication. 
4	Elderly men with histories of heavy drinking: correlates and consequences. Recognition that the physical, psychological and social consequences of substance abuse may persist throughout the life span has led to increased study of the impact of lifetime drinking habits on the elderly. We examined the characteristics of elderly men with self-reported histories of having ever been heavy drinker (H+) in a population-based (N = 1,155, mean age = 73.7 years) longitudinal survey of community-dwelling elders; 10.4% of the men reported that they had been heavy drinkers at some time during their lives. H+ men were younger and less educated than non-heavy drinkers (H-) or never drinkers (N). Mortality was higher among H+ men who were current drinkers than among H- or N men. H+ men reported more major illnesses, poorer self-perceived health status, more physician visits, more depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction and smaller social networks than did H- or N men. Self-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living was poorest among H+ men, who also scored the lowest on a mental status examination. Thus, a history of having ever been a heavy drinker is predictive of widespread impairments in physical, psychological and social health and functioning among elderly men. 
2	Clinical evaluation of plasma abnormal prothrombin (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) in hepatobiliary malignancies and other diseases. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), a protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) was measured in the plasma of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and those with various other hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. DCP levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay (E-1023), using an anti-DCP monoclonal antibody. Forty-two of the 91 patients (46.2%) with hepatocellular carcinoma had abnormally elevated levels of DCP, whereas only one of the 24 patients with hepatic cirrhosis showed a slight increase. An increase was also observed in some patients with obstructive jaundice. There was no correlation between plasma levels of DCP and those of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma DCP levels normalized after curative surgical resection. Plasma DCP levels were not related to the plasma concentration of vitamin K in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma DCP determination may be useful in the diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1	Human catechol-O-methyltransferase: cloning and expression of the membrane-associated form. A cDNA clone for human catechol-O-methyltransferase (hCOMT; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:catechol O-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.6) was isolated from a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2) cDNA library by hybridization screening with a porcine cDNA probe. The cDNA clone was sequenced and found to have an insert of 1226 nucleotides. The deduced primary structure of hCOMT is composed of 271 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa. At its N terminus it has a hydrophobic segment of 21 amino acid residues that may be responsible for insertion of hCOMT into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The primary structure of hCOMT exhibits high homology to the porcine partial cDNA sequence (93%). The deduced amino acid sequence contains two tryptic peptide sequences (T-22, T-33) found in porcine liver catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The coding region of hCOMT cDNA was placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to transfect human kidney 293 cells. The endogenous COMT activity, which was approximately 9.98 units per mg of protein in the untransfected cells, increased to 206 units per mg of protein upon transfection with a plasmid containing the COMT cDNA. The COMT activity of recombinant protein was inhibited competitively (IC50 = 700 nM) by the selective COMT inhibitor Ro 40-7592. An anti-COMT monoclonal antibody recognized, on immunoblots, a major polypeptide with apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, in reasonable agreement with the predicted molecular mass. The recombinant hCOMT was shown by immunoblot analysis to be mainly associated with the membrane fraction. RNA blot analysis revealed one COMT mRNA transcript of 1.4 kilobases in Hep G2 poly(A)+ RNA. 
4	Rarity of preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy in chronic alcoholics less than 40 years of age. Preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy, myocardial damage in the absence of overt congestive heart failure in chronic alcoholics, is well characterized at necropsy, but attempts to identify such a clinical entity before death have produced conflicting results. Studying subjects only at rest, the inclusion of older alcoholics and limitations of noninvasive techniques may explain some of the disagreement. To determine if preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy could be identified independent of the aforementioned limitations, 25 asymptomatic chronic alcoholics aged less than 40 years (mean 34), each of whom had consumed a minimum of 1 pint of whiskey or one 6-pack of beer greater than or equal to 5 days per week for greater than or equal to 5 years, underwent radionuclide ventriculography for measurements of systolic and diastolic function at rest, peak supine exercise and during recovery, and echocardiography for assessment of chamber size, wall thickness and left ventricular mass. Red blood cell levels of selenium and thiamine were measured to determine whether abnormalities were present in these 2 potential mediators of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. For comparison, an age-matched group of healthy control subjects was also studied. For alcoholics and control subjects at rest, mean ejection fraction (67 +/- 7% vs 71 +/- 6%) and diastolic peak filling rate (3.4 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes per second [EDV/s]) were similar. 
4	Assessment of ventricular function with an ambulatory left ventricular function monitor. Changes in ventricular function caused by activities of daily living, including standing, walking, stair climbing, and mental stress, were evaluated using a radionuclide device that recorded left ventricular function on a beat-by-beat basis. The ambulatory monitor was positioned over the patient's left ventricle after a gated blood pool scan. Monitoring revealed a 10% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to brisk walking, an 18% increase during stair climbing, and a 6% increase with mental stress. In some subjects, however, the increase in ejection fraction during mental stress exceeded that during exercise. 
2	Recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection. Recurrent Crohn's disease develops in most patients after surgical resection if the patient is followed for sufficient time. This review examines various aspects of recurrent Crohn's disease. It is concluded that Crohn's disease is a diffuse condition of the gastrointestinal tract and that radical resection of Crohn's disease does not prevent recurrence. Assorted factors thought to be associated with recurrence are examined and the relevance of these factors to the surgeon treating Crohn's disease is discussed. 
5	Identification of herpes simplex virus DNA in lesions of erythema multiforme by the polymerase chain reaction. An association between erythema multiforme and herpes simplex virus infection has been supported by clinical studies and by the detection by immunofluorescence of herpes viral antigen in sera and skin biopsy specimens of patients with erythema multiforme. In rare cases, the virus has also been isolated in cultures of skin biopsy specimens of erythema multiforme. To investigate further the association between erythema multiforme and herpes simplex virus, we used the polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus to examine skin lesions from patients with erythema multiforme. In this study herpes simplex virus DNA was detected in 11 of 31 biopsy specimens of erythema multiforme; six additional cases showed equivocal amplification results, which is suggestive of low amounts of viral DNA. Seven skin and mucosal biopsy specimens with the histologic changes of herpes virus infection served as positive controls: all were positive for herpes simplex virus DNA. Viral DNA was not detected in control biopsy specimens from skin excised for unrelated conditions. These studies support the association of herpes simplex virus in the pathogenesis of some cases of erythema multiforme. The polymerase chain reaction provides a quick and effective method of detecting herpes simplex virus in lesions of herpes-associated erythema multiforme. Furthermore, the polymerase chain reaction may delineate those cases of erythema multiforme that are etiologically related to herpes virus infection and therefore might be treated with acyclovir to prevent recurrence. 
5	Separation and characterization of saponins with adjuvant activity from Quillaja saponaria Molina cortex. Saponins were purified from Quillaja saponaria Molina bark by silica and reverse phase chromatography. The resulting purified saponins were tested for adjuvant activity in mice. Several distinct saponins, designated QS-7, QS-17, QS-18, and QS-21, were demonstrated to boost antibody levels by 100-fold or more when used in mouse immunizations with the Ag BSA and beef liver cytochrome b5. These purified saponins increased titers in all major IgG subclasses. To determine optimal dose in mice for adjuvant response, QS-7 and QS-21 were tested in a dose-response study in intradermal immunization with BSA in mice; for both of these purified saponins, adjuvant response (determined by stimulation of ELISA titers to BSA) neared maximum at doses of 5 micrograms and was shown to plateau up to the highest dose tested, 80 micrograms. These purified saponins vary considerably in their toxicity, as assessed by lethality in mice; the main component, QS-18, being the most toxic. Saponins QS-7 and QS-21 showed no or very low toxicity in mice, respectively. None of these saponins stimulated production of reaginic antibodies. The monosaccharide composition of these saponins showed similar but distinct compositions with all four containing fucose, xylose, galactose and glucuronic acid. Predominant differences were observed in the quantities of rhamnose, arabinose, and glucose. Monomer m.w. (determined by size exclusion HPLC) were determined to range from 1800 to 2200. 
5	Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems. Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid. The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed. Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion. Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling. The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two. After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications. The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids. 
5	Subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We report a rare case of a patient in whom severe subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema occurred in association with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and in whom overdistention or disruption of alveoli with obliteration of the respiratory bronchioles was revealed on open lung biopsy. This case suggests that obstructive bronchiolitis with hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an etiologic factor of mediastinal emphysema. 
4	Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. 
4	Multicenter patency trial of intravenous anistreplase compared with streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The TEAM-2 Study Investigators. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcome when administered early after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction; the mechanism of benefit is believed to be reestablishment and maintenance of coronary artery patency. Anistreplase is a second generation thrombolytic agent that is easily administered and has a long duration of action. To compare anistreplase (30 units/2-5 min) and therapy with the Food and Drug Administration-approved regimen of intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million units/60 min), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter patency trial was undertaken in 370 patients less than 76 years of age with electrocardiographic ST segment elevation who could be treated within 4 hours of symptom onset. Coronary patency was determined by reading, in a blinded fashion, angiograms obtained early (90-240 minutes; mean, 140 minutes) and later (18-48 hours; mean, 28 hours) after beginning therapy. Early total patency (defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 2 or 3 perfusion) was high after both anistreplase (132/183 = 72%) and streptokinase (129/176 = 73%) therapy, and overall patency patterns were similar, although patent arteries showed "complete" (grade 3) perfusion more often after anistreplase (83%) than streptokinase (72%) (p = 0.03). Similarly, residual coronary stenosis, determined quantitatively by a validated computer-assisted method, was slightly less in patent arteries early after anistreplase (mean stenosis diameter, 74.0%) than streptokinase (77.2%, p = 0.02). In patients with patent arteries without other early interventions, reocclusion risk within 1-2 days was defined angiographically and found to be very low (anistreplase = 1/96, streptokinase = 2/94). Average coronary perfusion grade was greater, and percent residual stenosis was less, at follow-up than on initial evaluation and did not differ between treatment groups. Enzymatic and electrocardiographic evolution was not significantly different in the two groups. Despite rapid injection, anistreplase was associated with only a small (4-5 mm Hg), transient (at 5-10 minutes) mean differential fall in blood pressure. In-hospital mortality rates were comparable for anistreplase and streptokinase (5.9%, 7.1%). Stroke occurred in one (0.5%) and three (1.6%) patients, respectively; one stroke was hemorrhagic. Other serious bleeding events and adverse experiences occurred uncommonly and with similar frequency in the two groups. Thus, for the end points of our study (patency, safety), anistreplase and streptokinase showed overall favorable and relatively comparable outcomes, with a few differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Iatrogenic contamination of multidose vials in simulated use. A reassessment of current patient injection technique. An investigation of the potential spread of iatrogenic infections through contaminated multidose vials was performed. Contamination of a multidose vial was hypothesized to occur after a single syringe is used to inject an infected patient with medication, and the same syringe subsequently is used to withdraw additional medication from the multidose vial. If the contaminated multidose vial is used for another patient, an iatrogenic infection may be spread. Laboratory study of this injection technique found that viral plaque-forming units could be transmitted to a multidose vial in this manner. A survey of 100 fellows of the American Academy of Dermatology from the United States found that 24% of the respondents used this potentially unsafe procedure. The potential for iatrogenic spread of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus is described. Recommendations to avoid patient infection are made. 
3	Reduction of post-traumatic swelling and compartment pressure by impulse compression of the foot. Following the discovery of a powerful venous pump in the foot that is activated by weight-bearing independently of muscular action, a pneumatic impulse device was developed to actuate this pump artificially. In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated. Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided. We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation. The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important. 
4	Hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumption coagulopathy. We describe a case of hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with both microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and consumption coagulopathy, but without thrombocytopenia, which was completely cured by surgical resection of the tumor. The patient was a 54-yr-old Japanese woman whose chief complaint was right upper abdominal discomfort. Angiography and dynamic computed tomography revealed typical findings of hepatic cavernous hemangioma. The patient also had hematological disorders. At surgery, we performed an atypical right lobectomy to preserve as much normal liver tissue as possible. The patient has been well, with no related complaints or abnormal laboratory findings, 5 yr since her operation. This case indicates that giant cavernous hemangioma of the liver should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MAHA, and if surgical treatment is adequate, hematological abnormalities may be eliminated. 
4	Doppler echocardiographic assessment of changes in pulmonary artery pressure associated with vasodilating therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Transpulmonic pressure gradient and pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated from the Doppler pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation. In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities. 
4	Thrombus in a natural left ventricle during left ventricular assist: another thromboembolic risk factor. Systemic thromboembolism is one of the serious complications during use of a left ventricular assist system (LVAS). The authors' original LVAS has excellent antithrombogenicity to reduce this risk, but thrombus formation in a natural left ventricle (LV) is another risk factor for systemic embolization. We used our LVAS in 22 patients. Of these, LV wall motion was studied in 15, and a smoke-like echo disclosed thrombus in the LV in eight. When LVAS sufficiently supported the systemic circulation, LV wall motion was irregular upon closure of the aortic valve. Upon recovery of LV function and decrease of LVAS flow, the smoke-like echo diminished and LV thrombus decreased in one, but LV thrombus remained unchanged or increased in seven. Systemic administration of antithrombotic agents had an unclear effect. Seven of eight patients with LV thrombus on echo died during or after LVAS. In these seven, a high incidence of LV thrombus (71%), and systemic embolism to the brain (29%) or kidney (86%), were revealed at necropsy. We subsequently used local heparinization to prevent LV thrombus formation. One patient with a smoke-like echo had no evidence of LV thrombus or systemic embolism. During LV assist, careful management of the LVAS, and intra-LV heparinization should be considered to reduce the risk of thrombus formation in the natural LV. 
3	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A prospective study of 50 patients. Management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) should be based on the presence and progression of visual loss. To characterize the clinical course of IIH more completely, we monitored the clinical status, especially visual function, in 50 consecutive newly-diagnosed patients over a period of 2 to 39 months (average follow-up 12.4 months). The mean age at onset of symptoms was 31 (range 11-58) yrs; 46 (92%) were women and 47 (94%) were obese (mean weight 90 kg). Common symptoms were headache (92%), transient visual obscurations (72%) and intracranial noises (60%); 13 of the patients (26%) initially had complaints of sustained visual loss. There was visual loss as determined by Goldmann perimetry in 96% and by automated perimetry in 92%. Contrast sensitivity testing was abnormal in 50% and Snellen acuity in 22%. Two patients (4%) became blind in both eyes. The Goldmann visual field grade improved in 60% of patients but visual function deteriorated in 5 (10%). Deterioration of visual field grade was significantly associated only with weight gain during the year before diagnosis. Visual loss in patients with IIH is common and is often reversible. Patients should be evaluated by perimetry using an appropriate strategy and contrast sensitivity testing, along with careful examination of the optic discs. 
2	Delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia, an unusual cause of colon obstruction. The earliest symptoms of diaphragmatic hernia may not appear until viscera incarcerate in it years after the causal injury. The most unusual site for a diaphragmatic hernia to occur is through the central tendon of the diaphragm into the pericardium. We present the case of a 43-year-old man who suffered a bowel obstruction when the transverse colon and omentum became incarcerated in the intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia. The defect presumably resulted from blunt chest and abdominal trauma received 15 years earlier. The delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia is reviewed, and recommendations for evaluation and treatment are made. 
1	A randomized study of methanol-extraction residue of bacille Calmette-Guerin as postsurgical adjuvant therapy of uveal melanoma. A randomized controlled clinical trial of methanol-extracted residue of bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant treatment of posterior uveal melanoma was undertaken. Of 113 patients, 34 patients received adjuvant immunotherapy and 79 patients received no treatment. No difference in survival was observed between the adjuvant-treated group and the control group of patients. This study found that the size of the tumor was a highly significant risk factor for death caused by metastasis of uveal melanomas. The standard deviation of the nucleolar area of the neoplastic cells was a significant risk factor, even though patients with tumors composed of Callender's spindle-type cells were not included in the study. 
4	Effect of ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion on superoxide dismutase activity in rat brain. Acute cerebral ischemia increases the generation of free radicals, causing cell damage, and theoretically may decrease the activity of the scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase. To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase in cerebral ischemia, we used a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In this model an infarct is produced in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, extending into the lateral basal ganglia. We measured superoxide dismutase activity by using the xanthine oxidase cytochrome c reduction assay in these areas of rat brains. Tissue samples were analyzed 20 minutes, 2, 6, or 24 hours, or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 2 or 24 hours or 7 days after sham operation (n = 8-10 at each time). There was no significant change in superoxide dismutase activity relative to control values in any brain area at any time up to 24 hours after surgery. However, 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion a significant decline in superoxide dismutase activity, to 55%-68% (p less than 0.05) of that in unoperated controls, was observed in all brain areas. Our results do not support an important role for changes in the activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. However, the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity 7 days after ischemia could indicate ongoing additional damage to peri-infarct tissue. 
1	Parascapular free flaps for head and neck reconstruction. We report our experience with single-stage, primary reconstruction of the head and neck in 29 consecutive patients using parascapular free flaps. The commonest indications were for craniofacial defects (9), oropharyngeal soft tissue defects (10), and combined mandibular and soft tissue losses (4). Ablative surgery was performed for squamous carcinoma (22), melanoma (2), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (2). Seven patients died of recurrent disease during a 3 1/2 year follow-up. Seven patients are alive with recurrence. Flap complications included total loss (2) due to unsalvageable microvascular thrombosis, wound breakdown with oropharyngeal fistula (2), mandibular osteomyelitis (1), trismus (2), neck contracture (1), and donor site wound dehiscence (1). The overall success of this reconstruction was 93%. Primary wound healing was the general rule with lower morbidity than with other reconstructive techniques. The flap is thin, pliable, and conforms well to three-dimensional defects. The lateral border of the scapula can be incorporated on the same vascular pedicle for single-stage mandibular reconstruction. No muscle is sacrificed, and the posterior donor defect is an added advantage. The parascapular flap is our first choice for reconstruction of major defects in the head and neck. 
2	Helicobacter pylori infection in pernicious anemia: a prospective controlled study. Although some authors believe that Helicobacter pylori is the etiologic agent in chronic nonspecific gastritis, it has also been suggested that the bacterium colonizes inflamed mucosa as a secondary event. This study documents the prevalence of H. pylori in 28 patients with pernicious anemia and compares the findings with those of a group of 28 age-, race-, and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects. All subjects underwent endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric antrum and corpus. A sample of serum was obtained before endoscopy for determination of antibodies (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) to H. pylori. The prevalence of H. pylori (by biopsy) in patients with pernicious anemia was significantly less than that in controls (11% vs. 71%, P less than 0.0001). All patients with pernicious anemia had abnormalities of corpus histology (inflammation and/or atrophy). In addition, 50% of patients with pernicious anemia had a lymphocytic infiltration of the antrum. All controls with H. pylori had gastritis, 50% having active chronic gastritis. Atrophic changes of the corpus were more commonly found in patients with pernicious anemia (75% vs. 7%, P less than 0.0001). Serology and biopsy results correlated poorly in the patients with pernicious anemia: all 5 patients with positive serology results had negative biopsy results, whereas all 3 patients with positive cultures on biopsy had negative serological studies. In conclusion, patients with pernicious anemia are protected from infection with H. pylori, and H. pylori does not passively colonize mucosa inflamed by an unrelated process. 
5	Use of H2-receptor antagonists in children. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have evolved into the mainstay of anti-acid therapy for pediatric patients, replacing antacids and other modes of therapy. Much of the experience and data used for therapeutic decisions in children, however, have been extrapolated from adult studies. Ranitidine and cimetidine have been studied most extensively in the adult and pediatric populations. Both raise gastric pH and achieve other therapeutic endpoints; however, cimetidine appears to have a greater frequency of both adversed effects and drug interactions. H2RAs are the preferred agents for prevention of stress ulcers, ulcer disease, and reflux esophagitis in the pediatric population. 
4	Effects of fish oil supplements in NIDDM subjects. Controlled study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a fish oil preparation (MaxEPA) on hemostatic function and fasting lipid and glucose levels in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects. Eighty NIDDM outpatients aged 55.9 yr (mean SD 11.5 yr) participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study of MaxEPA capsules (10 g/day) or olive oil (control) treatment over 6 wk. Patients received either MaxEPA or olive oil in addition to preexisting therapy. Metabolic and hemostatic variables were measured before treatment and after 3 and 6 wk. Platelet membrane eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content increased in the treatment group (P less than 0.001). MaxEPA supplementation was associated with a significant fall in total triglycerides (P less than 0.001) but did not affect total cholesterol (P = 0.7) compared with control treatment. Fasting plasma glucose increased after 3 wk (P = 0.01) but not after 6 wk (P = 0.17) treatment with MaxEPA. Spontaneous platelet aggregation in whole blood fell in the MaxEPA group (P less than 0.02) after 6 wk, but there were no changes in agonist-induced platelet aggregation, thromboxane generation in platelet-rich plasma, or plasma beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor IV levels. An increase in clotting factor VII (P = 0.02), without changes in fibrinogen or factor X levels, occurred in the MaxEPA group. Similar reductions in blood pressure were observed in both groups. Dietary supplementation with MaxEPA capsules (10 g/day) in NIDDM subjects is associated with improvement in hypertriglyceridemia but with deleterious effects in factor VII and blood glucose levels. Most indices of platelet function are unaffected by this therapy. 
3	Isolation of sequences that span the fragile X and identification of a fragile X-related CpG island [published erratum appears in Science 1991 Apr 26;252(5005):494] Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were obtained from a 550-kilobase region that contains three probes previously mapped as very close to the locus of the fragile X syndrome. These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization. An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression. A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males. This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome. 
1	Long-term adjuvant therapy of high-risk malignant melanoma with interferon alpha 2b. Fifty-three high-risk melanoma patients in stage I and 15 patients in stage II were treated after standard surgical intervention with adjuvant therapy with recombinant interferon alpha-2b (rIFN alpha 2b) therapy for a total period of 20 months. Concomitant patients (stage I, n = 82; stage II, n = 33) with identical stages and prognostic factors without adjuvant therapy were used to evaluate the efficacy of rIFN alpha 2b therapy. No difference in 5-year relapse incidence and overall survival rates could be detected. However, it appears that patients of both stage I and stage II benefit from long-term adjuvant rIFN alpha 2b therapy, because during the treatment period (20 months), the incidence of relapses was lower in comparison to controls. After stopping treatment the incidence of relapse is equal in treated and control groups. According to the results of our study, we suggest using continuous low-dose rIFN alpha 2b therapy for adjuvant treatment of malignant melanoma. 
3	Clinical value of magnetic resonance imaging for cervical myelopathy. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 115 cases of cervical myelopathy, 121 cases of cervical radiculopathy, and 64 cases of neck pain with no neurologic deficit were prospectively studied to investigate the clinical value of MRI for cervical myelopathy. The MRI findings in the T1-weighted sagittal projection were classified into four groups according to the degree of the compressed deformities of the cervical cord. The degree of compression of the cervical cord on MRI findings showed a significant correlation with the severity of myelopathy, the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal column, and the degree of compression of the dural tube in the myelograms (P less than 0.01). Fifty-one patients of cervical myelopathy had undergone both preoperative and postoperative MRI. Of these, the spinal canal of 47 patients that was well decompressed was recognized according to plain computed tomography (CT). However, 24 (51%) of these 47 patients showed on MRI a deformity in the spinal cord amounting to cord atrophy. The correlation between the clinical function of the spinal cord and the recovery of the cord deformity on MRI at the operative levels was accurately investigated in 34 patients who had no cord deformities in the adjacent intervertebral levels. Twenty patients with cord atrophy had slightly poor clinical results, although no significant difference was found between these 20 and 14 patients with recovery in the cord deformities. From these results, it was evident that T1-weighted MRI is useful in the accurate diagnosis of compression myelopathy, in accurately deciding the level of the disease focus, and in the accurate assessment of the surgical results. 
1	Bladder outlet obstruction due to pelvic lipoma: computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and radiographic evaluation. We report an unusual case of long-standing bladder outlet obstruction due to pelvic lipoma in a 31-year-old white man. The mass was evaluated by plain film, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The differential diagnosis of fat-containing extraperitoneal pelvic masses is discussed. 
4	LVAS pump performance following initiation of left ventricular assistance. Prevention of disturbed flow (e.g., flow stasis) and consequent thrombosis in heart pumps is based upon design characteristics determined during laboratory bench tests. These tests employ optimal filling and emptying characteristics, such as the full-fill to complete empty mode in the Novacor left ventricular assist system. Filling characteristics of the Novacor LVAS were examined during the first 48 hours after implantation in 14 patients. Fill volume of the pump was reduced in pathologic states, such as cardiac tamponade, and following the initiation of right ventricular mechanical circulatory support. In addition, multiple regression analysis revealed that right ventricular function measured by the amount of inotropic support required, the right ventricular ejection fraction, and the total pulmonary resistance, significantly predicted left ventricular assist pump fill volume during the first 48 hours of support. Flow visualization simulating these clinical conditions of incomplete filling suggest inadequate valve washing, particularly around the inlet valve and its conduit, which may predispose to thrombus formation. 
4	Left atrial to femoral arterial bypass using the biomedicus pump for operations of the thoracic aorta. Left atrial to left femoral arterial bypass is an approach to operations of the thoracic aorta dating back to the late 1950s. Since that time, various modifications of the basic bypass circuit have evolved. In addition, temporary bypass shunts have also been described in a variety of positions. The goals of bypass of the thoracic aorta regardless of the technique include prevention of distal hypoperfusion, which can lead to paraplegia, limb loss, multiple organ failure, and sometimes death. Recently, there have been reports of the use of the biomedicus centrifugal pump in bypass circuits of the thoracic aorta. Our series, as well as the success of others, using this variation of a traditional bypass circuit of the thoracic aorta, establishes the biopump's capability of minimizing inherent complications in the bypass circuit. 
5	Aberrant origin of the right coronary artery as a potential cause of sudden death: successful anatomical correction. A man with an aberrant right coronary artery and haemodynamically important prolapse of the mitral valve was successfully resuscitated. The aberrant right coronary artery was thought to be a possible cause of the cardiopulmonary arrest in this patient. Both lesions were corrected at a single operation. 
2	Primary cytomegalovirus infection and gastric ulcers in normal host. A 42-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain and vomiting. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed three gastric ulcers. Histologic examination of biopsies from the ulcers showed cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies. The appearance of IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus indicated a recent and primary infection. Stored serum from her last pregnancy 17 months previously contained no cytomegalovirus antibodies. A thorough evaluation of her immune system revealed no abnormality. We are aware of only two other cases where seroconversion was documented in normal hosts. Cytomegalovirus infections in the gastrointestinal tract of normal hosts are very unusual but a common cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. We believe that cytomegalovirus may have a role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lesions in nonimmunocompromised patients. 
4	Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: pathologic observations in 20 patients Histopathologic examination was performed in 20 patients undergoing antemortem coronary angioplasty. Thirty-four lesions were dilated and the interval between coronary angioplasty and death ranged from several hours to 4 years. Intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells, as a major cause of restenosis, was observed in 83% to 100% of 28 lesions examined 11 days to 2 years after coronary angioplasty. In 20 lesions examined within 6 months, proliferating smooth muscle cells were predominantly of the synthetic type and there was abundant extracellular matrix substance chiefly composed of proteoglycans. In eight lesions examined between 6 months and 2 years, contractile type smooth muscle cells were dominant and extracellular matrix was composed chiefly of collagen. In three lesions examined after 2 years, evidence of antemortem coronary angioplasty was hardly identifiable and these lesions were almost indistinguishable from conventional atherosclerotic plaque. These temporal changes in histologic pattern provide a pathologic background for clinical reports that restenosis is predominantly found within 6 months after coronary angioplasty. Morphometric analysis revealed that the extent of intimal proliferation was significantly greater in lesions with evidence of medial or adventitial tears than in lesions with no or only intimal tears. 
1	Treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin before marrow transplantation. Combination chemotherapy is capable of curing many patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but treatment of relapsed NHL remains problematic. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers the best chance for disease-free survival, but interim chemotherapy is often necessary while awaiting BMT, especially for patients with bulky disease. We report here 39 patients (median age, 44 years) who failed primary therapy with doxorubicin-based regimens and subsequently were treated with one to six cycles of dexamethasone, 40 mg intravenous (IV) every day on days 1 to 4, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion on day 1, and cytarabine 2 g/m2 IV every 12 hours x two doses on day 2 (DHAP) before the planned BMT. Histologies included 16 diffuse large-cell, six diffuse mixed, five diffuse small-cleaved, four lymphoblastic, and eight other. Twenty-eight patients had stage IV disease, 13 had B symptoms, and 20 had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients had been treated with a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens. Sixty-one percent of patients had high tumor burdens according to the MD Anderson criteria. Objective responses to DHAP were seen in 26 patients (67%) including nine complete responses (CRs) (23%) and 17 partial responses (PRs) (44%), and responses lasted a median of 7.5 months. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity, but there were no treatment-related deaths. To date, 17 patients have undergone subsequent BMT with a projected 3-year disease-free survival of 15%. We conclude that the DHAP regimen is effective short-term salvage therapy for relapsed NHL patients, but the long-term prognosis of multiply relapsed patients remains poor. 
4	Six year follow up of a consecutive series of patients presenting to the coronary care unit with acute chest pain: prognostic importance of the electrocardiogram In a retrospective 6 year follow up data were obtained for 536 of 566 (95%) consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with acute chest pain. Their diagnoses were acute myocardial infarction in 290 (54%), myocardial ischaemia in 164 (31%), pericarditis in 16 (3%), and non-cardiac in 66 (12%). Six year mortality was 36%, 24%, 0%, and 16% respectively. In patients with acute myocardial infarction a higher mortality rate during follow up was associated with a higher than average age, a higher than average creatine kinase, previous myocardial infarction, Q wave infarction, and the presence of reciprocal changes. The presence of reciprocal changes was associated with higher than average concentration of serum creatine kinase, indicating more extensive infarction. Infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation or left bundle branch block was associated with a higher death rate. The electrocardiogram recorded at the time of acute myocardial infarction contains much useful prognostic information. 
4	Potential complications of high-dose epinephrine therapy in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest Adults resuscitated from nontraumatic cardiac arrest who received intravenous epinephrine in doses chosen by the treating physician and who survived at least 6 hours were studied to determine if high-dose epinephrine produced more complications than standard-dose. A total of 68 patients were enrolled and evaluated for postresuscitation complications attributable to epinephrine, using a two-tailed t test, and contingency analysis. The 33 patients receiving high-dose epinephrine and 35 patients receiving standard-dose epinephrine were similar in demographics and variables known to affect outcome. There was no difference in potential complications between groups except serum calcium, which was 1.97 mmol/L (SD, 0.20) in the high-dose epinephrine group and 2.10 (SD, 0.20) in the standard-dose group. Hospital discharge rates (18% in the high-dose vs 30% in the standard-dose group) and neurological status on discharge were not significantly different. High-dose epinephrine did not produce increased direct complications in this cardiac arrest population compared with standard-dose epinephrine. 
1	Parotid duct communicating with a labial pit and ectopic salivary cyst. Labial pits are usually described as blind epidermal invaginations of lip mucosa with occasional drainage of minor salivary gland secretions. A case of an aberrant parotid duct in communication with both a unilateral, commissural labial pit and an interposed salivary cyst is presented. A 7-year-old boy who had experienced lifelong clear drainage from a congenital pit at his right oral commissure developed fever, pain, and a submucosal mass of the right cheek over a 6-week period. A preoperative sialogram through the pit demonstrated a communication between the oral commissure fistula, an intervening salivary cyst, and a proximal tract from the cyst to the parotid gland. An en bloc resection of the pit, fistula tract, and cyst was performed through a transoral approach. The dissection was medial to the buccinator muscle. There has been no recurrence of the cyst after 1 year follow-up. A description of labial pits and parotid duct anomalies is presented; however, to our knowledge, this combination of anomalies has not been previously described. 
5	Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. A positive family history of autoimmune disease is common among patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, but usually autoimmunity is directed at organs other than the liver. We document for the first time the multiple occurrence of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. Out of a sibship of seven, three sisters developed this, one sister developed coeliac and autoimmune thyroid disease, one sister showed serological signs of autoimmunity, while the two brothers were well with no signs of autoimmunity. HLA typing showed that in association with the female sex DR3 seems to be more important than B8 in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, at least in this family. 
1	Endometrioma. An intra-abdominal troublemaker. A ten-year review of intestinal and abdominal wall endometriomas is reported. Seven cases of intestinal and two cases of abdominal wall endometriomas are presented. Symptoms were varied but a majority had some gynecologic complaint. In this select group of patients, preoperative investigations did not assist in establishing the diagnosis. All patients underwent surgery and coexisting inflammatory bowel disease was present in two patients. This review suggests that endometrioma of the intestine requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and that danazol does not appear to be effective treatment for these patients. 
5	Cortical atrophy and cognitive performance in infantile nephropathic cystinosis. A group of children and adolescents with infantile nephropathic cystinosis underwent cognitive testing and were examined for cortical atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Ten of 11 patients demonstrated cortical atrophy. A consistent pattern of lower cognitive performance was found in patients with greater atrophy; however, only the relationship between atrophy and short-term memory approached statistical significance. In addition, evidence for greater impairment of visual memory than of other cognitive functions was observed. This latter observation did not appear to be related to the degree of atrophy. 
2	Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy. We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression. Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2). Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes. 
1	In vivo incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate into a rat metastatic brain-tumor model. Lipid metabolism of an intracerebrally implanted brain tumor and normal brain was investigated in awake Fischer 344 rats using intravenously injected [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate as a probe. A suspension of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells (250 cells in 5 microliters medium), with or without 1% low-melting-point agar, was implanted into the caudate nucleus of rats 8 to 9 weeks old. Control animals received an intracerebral injection without tumor cells. Seven days after implantation, awake rats were infused intravenously for 5 minutes with [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate (6.4 mCi/kg). The rats were killed 20 minutes after initiation of the infusion and coronal brain slices were obtained for quantitative autoradiography and light histological study. Tumor cell masses were histologically well demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue. Tumor tissue incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate was heterogeneous, ranging on average from 3.1- to 6.1-fold greater than in the corresponding contralateral brain. In addition, incorporation corresponded to regional tumor cell density. The incorporation rate constant of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate in tumor was significantly increased compared to control brain and was independent of tumor size. Necrotic areas within tumors showed no incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate. Brain surrounding the tumors and control injection sites showed reactive gliosis, and possessed 30% greater incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate than contralateral normal brain. These results suggest that [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate can be used to image brain tumors in vivo, measuring turnover and/or synthesis of tumor and brain lipid. 
5	Acute and chronic bioeffects of single and multiple doses of piezoelectric shockwaves (EDAP LT.01). Piezoelectric second generation lithotriptors are an established means of administering extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) enabling treatment to be performed without anaesthesia or analgesia, but higher shockwave doses and multiple or staged treatment are frequently required. The bioeffects of this modality of ESWL, therefore, require further assessment. Seven experimental groups of adult male rabbits were treated using the EDAP LT.01 in order to determine the acute and chronic bioeffects of clinical dose, excess dose, divided excess dose, high frequency and multiple treatment (X10) piezoelectric shockwaves (PSW). Renal function was measured before and after treatment using mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG 3) scans. Gross and histological morphological changes were assessed at one and 30 days following application of PSW. Application of single clinical dose PSW was not associated with any significant functional or morphological renal injury. Excess dose PSW caused transient gross renal contusion, which resolved in the majority of animals with no persistent microscopic abnormality. Divided excess dose PSW resulted in no gross or microscopic damage. High frequency PSW was associated with mild histological abnormality. Multiple PSW treatments caused small discrete fibrotic lesions in all cases, without any change in renal function. 
5	Treatment of aggressive keratoacanthomas by radiotherapy. Keratoacanthomas infrequently are treated by radiotherapy. However, keratoacanthomas that are recurrent after surgical excision or whose resection would result in cosmetic deformity may benefit from radiotherapy. Between January 1970 and June 1988, 29 such keratoacanthomas in 18 patients were irradiated. Doses ranged from 3500 cGy in 15 fractions to 5600 cGy in 28 fractions. Measured end points of therapy were (1) initial response, (2) freedom from recurrence, and (3) quality of the subsequent cosmetic appearance (scored as good, fair, or poor). No lesion progressed and all eventually regressed completely. Cosmetic results generally were considered good by both the patient and the referring dermatologist; none of the results was considered poor. Our results demonstrate that radiation is an effective means of treating keratoacanthomas. 
1	Partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma: indications, results and implications. Of 52 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy for tumor 44 were found to have renal cell carcinoma. The indications for this parenchyma-sparing procedure were categorized according to the initial status of the contralateral kidney and included bilateral tumors or tumor in a solitary kidney in 16 patients (mandatory indications), unilateral carcinoma with compromise of the contralateral kidney by a benign disease process in 9 (relative indications) and small peripheral tumor with a normal contralateral kidney in 19 (elective indications). There were 4 recurrences that accounted for 3 deaths, all in patients with mandatory indications. All patients who underwent partial nephrectomy for relative or elective indications were without definite evidence of recurrent disease at last followup (over-all mean 36 months). Our results suggest that conservative surgery can often provide effective and advantageous therapy for renal cancer and we encourage further consideration of the role of partial nephrectomy as an alternative to radical nephrectomy in selected patients with small peripheral tumors and normal contralateral kidneys. 
5	Long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease. Personality hardiness, which has been conceptualized as a potential internal resource facilitating stress resistance, was examined in conjunction with Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and sociodemographic and medical variables to assess the independent differential correlations of these factors with long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease. One hundred twenty-eight patients completed the third generation Hardiness Scale, together with questionnaires measuring Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and psychosocial adjustment to illness. The results showed that personality hardiness was the most salient correlate of psychosocial adjustment. High hardiness scores were associated with good adjustment to the various life domains. Angina severity accounted for the variance in social domains, but not the psychologic distress domain. Type A behavior, both dimensions of perceived family dynamics, and the sociodemographic variables did not have a significant role in explaining the variance in psychosocial adjustment. We conclude that personality hardiness could serve as a valid indicator of long-term psychosocial adjustment in patients with coronary artery disease. 
2	Circadian esophageal motor function in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function and may contribute to the development of complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Using 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry, we compared the circadian esophageal motor activity of normal volunteers to that of patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus). The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury. The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter. This was particularly so in patients with stricture or Barrett's esophagus and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg). These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury. This appears to be caused by persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter. The need for surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is implicated. 
4	Infrainguinal revascularization for limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease. We studied the efficacy of infrainguinal bypass for limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease. The patency of 42 femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypasses, performed for limb salvage in 37 patients with end-stage renal disease, was assessed with Doppler ultrasonography and dye tests. Patency rates and limb salvage were determined by life-table analysis. Average age was 45 years (range, 28 to 61 years); 23 of the 37 were men. Twenty-three patients had diabetes mellitus, and 16 were smokers. Bypass procedures were done in 32 instances while the patients were maintained with chronic hemodialysis and in five instances with peritoneal dialysis; in five instances the patients had had successful renal transplantation. Indications for revascularization included pain at rest, nonhealing ulcer, or distal gangrene. Femoropopliteal bypass was done in 32 limbs; 10 were more distal procedures. Reversed saphenous vein was the conduit in 30 cases; prosthetic material was used in the remainder. Autogenous material was used in all distal bypasses. Four patients required graft revision during the initial hospitalization, but none thereafter. Two patients died within the operative period, nine within 18 months of operation. Nine major operations were required. Three-month cumulative graft patency was achieved in 41 cases and corresponding limb salvage in 33 cases; 18-month patency was achieved in 34 cases and overall limb salvage in 33 cases. Success of limb salvage most closely correlated with preoperative ankle-brachial ratio and level of bypass required. 
4	A lethal complication of papaverine-induced priapism. A large series of patients was treated for impotence with intracorporeal injections of papaverine and phentolamine with no major complications and no deaths reported. We report on a 45-year-old black man with advanced multiple sclerosis who died after such therapy. When the first self-administered injection of phentolamine and papaverine failed to produce an adequate erection the patient injected a second dose that resulted in priapism and death of massive pulmonary embolism. 
5	Capillary leakage in inflammation. A study by vascular labeling. The local injection of pure inflammatory mediators induces venular leakage. To test the effect of endogenous mediators from dying tissue on vascular leakage, the authors devised an experimental model simulating an infarct, whereby living vessels would be exposed to fragments of organs undergoing aseptic necrosis. Tissues from donor rats were implanted aseptically in the cremasteric sac. Control rats were implanted with materials deemed to be as close as possible to nonirritating: boiled tissues and spheres of Teflon or glass. At different points the rats were injected intravenously with carbon black and killed an hour later. Whole cremaster mounts showed that vascular labeling was strictly venular up to 8 hours, mixed with capillary labeling between 12 and 24 hours, and mainly or exclusively capillary at 48 hours. Histology showed an acute inflammatory infiltrate in the labeled areas. A similar but weaker labeling pattern accompanied by milder inflammation was seen in controls. These results indicate that the vascular leakage in aseptic inflammation is biphasic, first venular, then capillary; and that the capillary phase is induced by the inflammatory reaction itself, possibly through a form of diffuse angiogenesis. 
4	Antibodies directed against neutrophils (C-ANCA and P-ANCA) are of distinct diagnostic value in systemic vasculitis. In a prospective study, sera from over 700 patients with suspected vasculitis, including over 200 patients undergoing renal biopsy, were examined for antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen (ANCA). An indirect immunofluorescence assay on ethanol fixed human neutrophils identified two types of autoantibody: C-ANCA, which produces diffuse cytoplasmic staining and P-ANCA, which produces an artefactual nuclear/perinuclear staining pattern. The diagnosis of patients in whom ANCA of either form was found was established following case note review according to defined diagnostic criteria. Forty of 45 patients whose sera contained C-ANCA at a titre of greater than or equal to 1/40 satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyarteritis. Twelve of 30 patients with P-ANCA at a titre of greater than or equal to 1/40 were also classified as having one of these disorders. Seventeen of the remaining 18 patients had immune-mediated disorders with deep organ damage. Of 47 ANCA-positive patients who underwent renal biopsy, 21 had glomerulonephritis associated with Wegener's glomerulonephritis and a further 22 had a necrotizing or crescentic glomerulonephritis. Ethanol fixation is important for discrimination of C-ANCA and P-ANCA. C-ANCA are highly specific for Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis. In patients undergoing renal biopsy, the presence of these antibodies is highly specific for a necrotizing or crescentic glomerulonephritis. 
1	Primary central nervous system T-cell lymphoma. Case report. Primary central nervous system (CNS) T-cell lymphoma is extremely rare. The present case report provides immunocytochemical evidence for a cerebellar CNS T-cell lymphoma. The patient underwent surgery followed by radiation therapy and is alive and well 36 months postoperatively. The clinical and pathological features of primary CNS T-cell lymphoma as well as diagnostic measures and treatment options are discussed, together with a compilation of all previous case reports of primary CNS T-cell lymphomas. 
5	Aspiration pneumonia and the laryngeal mask airway A case of aspiration pneumonia is reported after the use of a laryngeal mask airway in a young woman undergoing an elective cholecystectomy. The case illustrates the hazards of regurgitation with the laryngeal mask airway and the need for further evaluation when used with controlled mechanical ventilation. 
4	Value of carvedilol in congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease. Despite considerable interest in the use of beta-blocking agents in congestive heart failure (CHF), their clinical application is limited because of their negative inotropic effects. Beta blockers with vasodilating properties may have the advantage of overcoming this, however. Carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent with vasodilating properties, was evaluated in 17 patients with chronic CHF secondary to ischemic heart disease with a resting left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 45%, who were being maintained on diuretics. Exercise testing, radionuclide ventriculography, and right-sided cardiac catheterization were performed and intraarterial blood pressure measured before and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy in a dosage of 12.5 to 50.0 mg twice a day. Twelve patients completed the study and 5 withdrew. Symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement was demonstrated in 11 of the 12 patients. Heart rate and intraarterial blood pressure were both reduced by chronic therapy. Mean +/- standard deviation exercise time improved from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 7.1 +/- 2.7 minutes (p less than 0.0001), as did resting left ventricular ejection fraction, from 27 +/- 9 to 31 +/- 11% (p less than 0.02). Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure fell from 19 +/- 7 mm Hg to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and total systemic vascular resistance from 1,752 +/- 403 to 1,497 +/- 310 dynes/s/cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.02). Stroke volume index improved also, from 31 +/- 6 ml to 40 +/- 6 ml (p less than 0.0005). These hemodynamic changes were mediated partly by vasodilation, diminished myocardial oxygen demand and reduction of sympathetic overactivity in the failing heart. These data suggest that carvedilol may have beneficial effects in patients with chronic CHF secondary to coronary artery disease. 
1	Treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin. The authors treated 14 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin or lip with one to four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin by bolus injection, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and bleomycin by continuous 5-day infusion. Objective responses were seen in 11 of the 13 evaluable patients (84%). Four patients had a complete remission (30%) and seven patients, a partial remission (54%). Local control after definitive complementary radiation and/or surgical treatment was achieved in seven patients. Toxic side effects was acceptable; they consisted of nausea and vomiting in all patients, transient skin changes, hematologic (Grade 3/4) abnormalities in four patients, and pulmonary fibrosis in one elderly patient. These results show that this chemotherapy combination could play a role in reducing the tumor mass and in facilitating definitive treatment to obtain better functional and cosmetic results in advanced SCC of the skin. 
2	Pharmacokinetics of famotidine after intravenous administration in liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine were studied after the administration of a single intravenous dose of 20-mg to seven normal volunteers, six patients with chronic hepatitis, 14 patients with compensated cirrhosis, and seven patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The plasma terminal elimination half-life of famotidine was significantly prolonged and famotidine total body clearance was significantly reduced in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, whose creatinine clearance was 57.2 +/- 6.7 ml/min/1.48 m2, but these changes were not significant in patients with chronic hepatitis (creatinine clearance: 109.2 +/- 10.5 ml/min/1.48 m2) or in patients with compensated cirrhosis (creatinine clearance: 72.2 +/- 26.5 ml/min/1.48 m2 in comparison with normal volunteers. The total volume of distribution at steady state was not significantly different between the normal volunteers and the three groups of patients. Famotidine total body clearance showed a weak but significant correlation with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001), serum albumin level (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01), and serum total bilirubin level (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), which suggested that the reduction in clearance was due in part to the concomitant renal impairment, as well as hepatic dysfunction in these patients. In conclusion, famotidine total body clearance was reduced in decompensated cirrhosis, indicating that the dose schedule requires modification in patients with this condition. 
1	Three staged approach to the surgical management of renal cell carcinoma extending into the right atrium. Case report. Left renal cell carcinoma extending into the right atrium was treated by angioinfarction, removal of right atrial tumour using cardiopulmonary bypass and ten days later abdominal radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy. Twenty four months later the patient remains well with no evidence of tumour recurrence. 
1	Familial multiple desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas. A kindred with familial multiple desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas is described. Desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas should be added to the group of lesions that indicate an inherited pattern when they occur as multiple primary tumors. The implications for nosologic status and treatment of desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas are considered. 
2	Endosonography of peri-anal and peri-colorectal fistula and/or abscess in Crohn's disease. Transcolorectal endosonography (ES) was performed in 36 patients with Crohn's disease suspected clinically to have a fistula or abscess. A hypoechoic or anechoic duct-like lesion immediately adjacent to the anorectal lumen compatible with a fistula was found in 32 patients. A communication between the fistulous tract and adjacent structures such as the skin, anal canal, or vagina was detected in all 32 patients. An anechoic cavity adjacent to or communicating with the fistula was visualized in 29 of the 36 patients. A fistula was visualized in the remaining seven patients with no evidence of an abscess. This anechoic cavity compatible with an abscess was surgically confirmed in 14 of 17 patients. We judged the extent and configuration of the abnormalities to be more clearly visualized by ES when results were compared with fistulography in five patients. There were no ES complications, and we conclude that ES is the preferred diagnostic procedure in patients with peri-rectal pathology because of the low risk of bacterial dissemination and low incidence of patient discomfort. Utilizing ES after non-surgical treatment was successful in 19 patients for documentation of the response to therapy. 
1	Pelvic resections: the Rizzoli Institute experience. Materials, methods, and techniques of pelvic resections are discussed. Results, including the complications of nerve damage, infection, and vascular, visceral, and reconstructive complications are tabulated. 
4	Usefulness of antithrombotic therapy in resting angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in preventing death and myocardial infarction (a pilot study from the Antithrombotic Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndromes Study Group). In a prospective pilot trial of antithrombotic therapy in the acute coronary syndromes (ATACS) of resting and unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, 3 different antithrombotic regimens in the prevention of recurrent ischemic events were compared for efficacy. Ninety-three patients were randomized to receive aspirin (325 mg/day), or full-dose heparin followed by warfarin, or the combination of aspirin (80 mg/day) plus heparin and then warfarin. Trial antithrombotic therapy was added to standardized antianginal medication and continued for 3 months or until an end point was reached. Analysis, by intention-to-treat, of the 3-month end points, revealed the following: recurrent ischemia occurred in 7 patients (22%) after aspirin, in 6 patients (25%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 16 patients (43%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; coronary revascularization occurred in 12 patients (38%) after aspirin, in 12 patients (50%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 22 patients (60%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; myocardial infarction occurred in 1 patient (3%) after aspirin, in 3 patients (13%) after heparin and warfarin, and in no patient after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin; no deaths occurred after aspirin or after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin, but 1 patient (4%) died after warfarin alone; major bleeding occurred in 3 patients (9%) after aspirin, in 2 patients (8%) after heparin and warfarin, and in 3 patients (8%) after aspirin combined with heparin and then warfarin. Recurrent myocardial ischemia occurred at 3 +/- 3 days after randomization. 
3	What practicing physicians in North Carolina rate as their most challenging geriatric medicine concerns. We recently surveyed a random sample of 500 physicians in family practice, general practice, and internal medicine in North Carolina, to discover their most challenging geriatric concerns. Using a three-stage survey technique, respondents were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the most challenging geriatric problems they face and what specific geriatric content areas would attract their participation in an educational program. They were then asked to rank 34 topics on which they would like more information. A total of 242 responses were received for a 55% response rate (63 of the 500 were undeliverable). Responses indicated that physicians are more concerned with management than diagnosis and revealed considerable evidence of empathy and concern. The top three topics had to do with the management of dementia, multiple problems, and depression. Approximately 25% of physicians consider problems of financing health care as among the most challenging problems. 
5	Improvement of septic syndrome after administration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH)? Twenty patients with generalized sepsis were studied prospectively to evaluate the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) administration. Five patients had developed sepsis after major abdominal surgery, 15 patients after multiple trauma with head injury (HTI-ISS 38 +/- 2 and Glasgow Coma Scale 4 +/- 1). The urea production rate (UPR) could be significantly reduced by the intramuscular administration of 1.5 IU of rhGH/kg bodyweight (BW) per day (UPR day: 5, 62 +/- 6.7 gm/d vs. UPR day: 10, 42.6 +/- 5.9 gm/d). The catabolic index of Bistrian (BI) was significantly lower after rhGH therapy on day 10 compared to day 5. IGF-1 increased significantly after the administration of rhGH. The nitrogen balance, however, did not become positive, despite the administration of rhGH. The changes in sepsis were estimated by the scoring system according to Elebute and Stoner on days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13. In those patients who were available for post-treatment evaluation the parameters had returned to baseline values after the withdrawal of rhGH. Results indicate that this therapy might ameliorate the nitrogen intake, but has no influence on the course of sepsis. Compared to previously published results in nonseptic patients, the somatomedin inhibitors as well as the split-products of the complement system and the metabolites of arachidonic acid may have been responsible for this weak effect of rhGH and IGF-1 in septicemia. 
5	Application of pulsed and continuous wave 1.32 and 1.06 microns wavelengths of the Nd:YAG laser in the canine tracheobronchial tree: a comparative study. Previous investigations have shown good clinical potential for the use of the 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser because its soft tissue absorption is better than that of the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser. The 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser has an absorption coefficient in water that is 10 times higher than the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser. A comparative in vivo study of laser soft tissue effects was performed by using the 1.32 microns wavelength and the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers in a pulsed wave (PW) mode and continuous wave (CW) mode using a non-contact endoscopic delivery system. A standard 5 mm mucosal lesion was made in the canine tracheobronchial tree down to the level of the perichondrium. Soft tissue and cartilage effects were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy, acutely, 1 week and 2 weeks after operation, and a comparison was made between the different laser modalities. To create similar lesions, higher energy was required when using the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser. Soft tissue injury was greater with the 1.06 microns wavelength in CW mode, and no cartilage damage occurred in the PW mode. Soft tissue and cartilage repair after 1 and 2 weeks was better with the 1.32 microns wavelength laser. In comparison, the CO2 laser and the contact Nd:YAG laser proved to be more precise cutting tools than the 1.32 microns wavelength or the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers. Both Nd:YAG laser wavelengths were useful for coagulation and vaporization of tissues and blood vessels. More studies are needed to determine the effect of the new 1.32 microns wavelengths on endotracheal tumors. 
5	Single lumen ileum with myectomy: a possible alternative to the pelvic reservoir in restorative proctocolectomy. An alternative procedure to construction of a pelvic ileal reservoir was assessed which avoids the need for a pouch, while providing an adequate rectal substitute and good continence. Thirty-six female adult beagles were allotted randomly to undergo total colectomy with (a) ileo-anal anastomosis alone, (b) ileo-anal anastomosis with two 15 cm myectomies, (c) ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy with an ileo-ileal valve, or (d) ileo-anal anastomosis with a duplicated J pouch. The animals were studied before operation and at 4-weekly intervals for 20 weeks after operation. Mortality rates were similar. Ileal compliance was increased significantly by myectomy from 0.64 ml/mmHg (median, interquartile range 0.49-0.78) after ileo-anal anastomosis alone to 1.65 mmHg (1.16-1.93), P less than 0.01, an increase which was maintained. Ileal capacity was also increased both by myectomy and by the J pouch: ileo-anal anastomosis = 85 ml (75-100 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy = 139 ml (116-156 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy and ileo-ileal valve = 125 ml (range 85-145 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch = 130 ml (range 75-165 ml) (P less than 0.01). Bowel function in the other three groups was markedly superior to ileo-anal anastomosis alone. Mean transit time was significantly less after ileo-anal anastomosis, 5.2 h (2.6-8.2 h) than after both ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy, 10.5 h (9.6-13.9 h), P less than 0.05 and ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch, 11.0 h (8.4-13.0 h), P less than 0.05, but addition of an ileo-ileal valve did not produce a further increase in transit time, 12.9 h (range 10.5-14.5 h), P = n.s. Myectomy of single lumen ileum may be a useful alternative to a pelvic ileal reservoir in restorative proctocolectomy. 
5	False aneurysm formation of the great arteries after arterial switch operation. An infant with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent a two-staged arterial switch operation, after which mediastinal infection occurred. Continuous irrigation with povidone-iodine solution was performed for 10 days. After that, the patient experienced life-threatening hemorrhage three times. At the time of the second hemorrhage, greater omental transfer was performed. On postoperative day 109, false aneurysm was recognized, having developed from both great arteries. Successful repair was performed on postoperative day 110. 
5	Restoration of liver function in Gunn rats without immunosuppression using transplanted microencapsulated hepatocytes. Microencapsulation of cells within synthetic semipermeable membranes is a novel technique that enables the transplantation of cell cultures without the need for immunosuppression. We have previously shown that transplanted isolated encapsulated hepatocytes can provide sufficient short-term metabolic support to improve the survival of animals with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Here we have demonstrated the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in providing long-term metabolic liver support in Gunn rats. Gunn rats have a congenital inability to conjugate bilirubin and thus exhibit lifelong hyperbilirubinemia. We studied the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in restoring this specific liver function. Free hepatocytes, isolated from male Wistar rats, were microencapsulated with collagen within a trilayered sodium alginate-poly-L-lysine-sodium alginate membrane using techniques developed in our laboratory. A total of 45 Gunn rats underwent intraperitoneal transplantation with free hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], isolated encapsulated hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], control (empty) microcapsules or no transplant (untreated controls). Serum bilirubin levels were monitored daily for 10 days after transplantation, and subsequent weekly samples were obtained for up to 1 mo. Microcapsules were studied by light and electron microscopy 1 mo after transplantation. During the first week after transplantation, the mean maximum reduction in serum bilirubin levels for the isolated encapsulated hepatocytes, free hepatocytes and control microcapsule transplanted groups was 45.7%, 18.6% and 14.3%, respectively. For up to 1 mo thereafter the mean reduction in serum bilirubin levels in these respective groups was 34.8%, 13.5% and 3.3%. 
5	Admissions to the intensive care unit after complications of anaesthetic techniques over 10 years. 2. The second 5 years Compared with the first 5 years there was a 19% increase in general anaesthetics, a 171% increase in local and (or) sedation techniques and a 9% increase in obstetric epidurals with no increase in anaesthetic staffing. In this second 5-year period, 46 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit as a result of a complication of an anaesthetic technique. These patients represented 1 in 2371 anaesthetic techniques carried out in the District compared with the previous 5 years where the incidence was 1 in 1543. Seven patients died (15.2%). The complication was considered to be wholly or partially avoidable in 14 instances (30.4%). Four of these subjects died. 
1	Amphotericin B vs high-dose ketoconazole for empirical antifungal therapy among febrile, granulocytopenic cancer patients. A prospective, randomized study. We compared high-dose ketoconazole (800 mg/kg per day, orally) with amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg per day, intravenously) for empirical antifungal therapy in a prospective, randomized study of persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients. Among 97 patients eligible for empirical antifungal therapy, 20 (21%) of these patients were ineligible for randomization to ketoconazole treatment because of their inability to tolerate oral medications. Among 72 patients eligible for randomization, 64 were assessable (32 in each arm of the study). Five of six patients with proved fungal infections who were randomized to receive ketoconazole treatment required crossover to amphotericin B treatment because of progressive infection. The conditions of three of these five patients improved after receiving amphotericin B. The frequency of transaminase elevation was higher in those receiving ketoconazole, while the frequency of azotemia was higher in those receiving amphotericin B. Bioavailability of ketoconazole was unpredictable. Amphotericin B remains the drug of choice for empirical antifungal therapy in granulocytopenic patients; whereas, lack of a parenteral formulation, ineffectiveness against proved mycoses, and unreliable bioavailability preclude high-dose ketoconazole from being an appropriate compound for this purpose. 
4	Hormone replacement therapy. How to select the best preparation and regimen. Hormone replacement therapy is a mainstay of preventive healthcare for the maturing female population. Estrogen deficiency that comes with menopause can have serious effects and is especially important in light of the increasing life expectancy of women. Various estrogen and progesterone preparations are available, and their best application requires understanding of the different potencies and metabolic effects. Daily maintenance therapy without a drug-free interval is becoming the standard method of the 1990s. No doubt the future will bring even better delivery regimens. 
1	Mastectomy following preoperative chemotherapy. Strict operative criteria control operative morbidity. The surgical morbidity associated with aggressive preoperative chemotherapy in 106 patients with advanced primary breast cancer who had chemotherapy followed by mastectomy was examined. These patients were compared with a group of 91 consecutive patients who had mastectomy without preoperative chemotherapy. Strict operative criteria were used to determine the timing of mastectomy following chemotherapy. Wound infection rates were no different in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone groups (7% versus 4%; p = 0.62). The incidence of wound necrosis was similar (11% versus 6%; p = 0.29). Seroma formation was decreased significantly in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone group (15% versus 28%; p = 0.04). Intensive preoperative chemotherapy did not delay the reinstitution of postoperative treatment (30% versus 20%; p = 0.27). However, when delay in instituting postoperative chemotherapy was more than 30 days, there was a significant decrease in overall survival rate (p = 0.04). This study provides evidence that intensive preoperative chemotherapy and mastectomy can be performed without increased morbidity. Furthermore it is important to institute systemic chemotherapy within 30 days of mastectomy to achieve maximum survival. 
4	Comparative clinical pharmacology of calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, both as initial monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. These drugs are also effective in the treatment of chronic, stable angina, variant angina and supraventricular arrhythmias. Drugs in this class have different affinities for calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, cardiac sinus and atrioventricular node. They are all useful in hypertension and angina, but only verapamil and diltiazem are also useful in the control of heart rate and supraventricular arrhythmias. Nimodipine may control vascular spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Calcium channel blockers have also been used in the treatment of migraine headache and Raynaud's phenomenon. 
5	Effects of spermatic vascular division for correction of the high undescended testis on testicular function. Orchiopexy with division of the spermatic artery and veins is a commonly used technique for correcting the high undescended testis, although the longterm results have not been clearly defined. The left spermatic artery and veins of 22 adult Wistar albino rats were divided while preserving the vessels associated with the vas and cremaster muscle (DT). A sham operation was performed on the left testicle of six additional rats (ST). At 3 weeks postoperatively, both testes from all rats were removed. All testes were viable and bled when incised, although bleeding was considerably reduced in testes with DT. Mean testicular weights after DT were 1,061 +/- 423 mg compared with 1,634 +/- 125 mg for ST rats (p less than 0.02) and 1,508 +/- 119 mg for contralateral testes. The mean tubular diameter after DT was 220 +/- 37 mu compared with 303.1 +/- 10.7 mu for ST testes (p less than 0.02). The testicular biopsy score based upon the morphology of the spermatic tubules was 4.46 +/- 3.32 for DT testes and 8.65 +/- 0.23 for ST testes (p less than 0.02) compared with 8.38 +/- 0.18 for contralateral testes and an absolute normal value of 10. No morphologic abnormalities were observed in the contralateral unoperated testes from any of the rats. The contralateral testes in 12 additional rats were removed before DT. The mean testosterone values in these rats with one testicle was 1.43 +/- 0.75 ng/mL. Three weeks after DT, testosterone values were 0.19 +/- 0.31 ng/mL (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that division of the main spermatic artery and vein in rats produces testicular atrophy with spermatogenic arrest and interstitial cell dysfunction. Although collateral blood flow to the testis may be demonstrated, tissue perfusion is inadequate for normal spermatogenesis and endocrine function. 
1	Petrosal sinus sampling: technique and rationale. Bilateral simultaneous sampling of the inferior petrosal sinuses is an extremely sensitive, specific, and accurate test for diagnosing Cushing disease and distinguishing between that entity and the ectopic ACTH syndrome. It is also valuable for lateralizing small hormone-producing adenomas within the pituitary gland. The inferior petrosal sinuses connect the cavernous sinuses with the ipsilateral internal jugular veins. The anatomy of the anastomoses between the inferior petrosal sinus, the internal jugular vein, and the venous plexuses at the base of the skull varies, but it is almost always possible to catheterize the inferior petrosal sinus. In addition, variations in size and anatomy are often present between the two inferior petrosal sinuses in a patient. Advance preparation is required for petrosal sinus sampling. Teamwork is a critical element, and each member of the staff should know what he or she will be doing during the procedure. The samples must be properly labeled, processed, and stored. Specific needles, guide wires, and catheters are recommended for this procedure. The procedure is performed with specific attention to the three areas of potential technical difficulty: catheterization of the common femoral veins, crossing the valve at the base of the left internal jugular vein, and selective catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses. There are specific methods for dealing with each of these areas. The sine qua non of correct catheter position in the inferior petrosal sinus is demonstration of reflux of contrast material into the ipsilateral cavernous sinus. Images must always be obtained to document correct catheter position. Special attention must be paid to two points to prevent potential complications: The patient must be given an adequate dose of heparin, and injection of contrast material into the inferior petrosal sinuses and surrounding veins must be done gently and carefully. When the procedure is performed as outlined, both inferior petrosal sinuses can be catheterized in more than 98% of patients. The complication rate is low, and the theoretical risk of major morbidity or death is less than 1% (neither has yet occurred, to our knowledge). The most common complication is groin hematoma. 
4	Comparison of myocardial imaging with iodine-123-iodophenyl-9-methyl pentadecanoic acid and thallium-201-chloride for assessment of patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Iodine-123-iodophenyl-9-methyl-pentadecanoic acid [( 123I]MPDA) and thallium-201 (201Tl) were sequentially injected in 11 patients during exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Simultaneous dual-energy planar images were obtained at 5 min, 3 and 5 hr. All studies were concordantly either positive (8/11) or negative (3/11) by both radionuclides. Exact agreement for segmental uptake was 93%, 94% and 94% for 5-min, 3- and 5-hr images, respectively. Exact agreement for defect reversibility by 3 and 5 hr were 95% and 92%. The initial defect contrasts and myocardial-to-lung ratios were similar by both agents but myocardial-to-liver ratio was lower by [123I]MPDA at 5 min, which became similar to 201Tl at 5 hr. Normal percent myocardial clearances of both agents were comparable and significantly higher than those in defect zones. Thus [123I]MPDA is suitable for myocardial imaging and correlates closely with 201Tl for initial postexercise myocardial uptake and defect reversibility. Defect reversibility appears to result from differential myocardial clearance from normal and ischemic regions. 
3	The risk for systemic vascular diseases and mortality in patients with central retinal vein occlusion. In this cross-sectional study, the authors evaluated 197 patients diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) at the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute between 1980 and 1985 to determine the risk of systemic disease and mortality. Complete follow-up information for mortality was obtained in 191 (97%). National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) patients and Wilmer cataract patients formed two comparison groups. The prevalence of hypertension was significantly elevated in the CRVO cases when compared with both comparison groups (P less than 0.03, 0.005). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was increased in CRVO cases in comparison with the NHIS group (P less than 0.005). The prevalence of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease was the same for all three groups, as was overall mortality. Mortality was not increased in CRVO cases as compared with United States mortality rates. 
5	Treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease: the case for combined modality treatment. In the initial series of 198 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a review of presenting chest radiographs available on 192 of these patients showed 49 patients with mediastinal masses greater than one third the greatest posteroanterior chest diameter. Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease. Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy. Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy. Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission). Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%. A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP. One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed. In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536). Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment. The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055). However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment. 
1	Equal parental origin of chromosome 22 losses in human sporadic meningioma: no evidence for genomic imprinting. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can occur either by mutation at the gene locus or by loss of part or all of the chromosome region containing the gene. The latter is most frequently detected by DNA markers as loss of heterozygosity in the tumor tissue. In several reports, the paternal homologue was preferentially retained in embryonal tumors associated with loss of particular chromosomal regions, suggesting genomic imprinting of the corresponding tumor suppressor loci. To explore the generality of these findings and the possible role of genomic imprinting in adult tumors of the nervous system, we have determined the parental origin of chromosome 22 loss in sporadic meningioma. Of nine cases studied, five tumors retained the maternally derived chromosome 22 homologue while four retained the paternally derived chromosome 22. Thus, in contrast to the embryonal tumors, the meningioma locus on chromosome 22 is inactivated by random mutation in sporadic adult meningiomas. 
4	The De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty. Perioperative mortality and long term follow-up. One hundred and fifty-three patients undergoing De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty, with or without other associated cardiac procedures between January, 1979, and June, 1987, were evaluated. There were 136 hospital survivors. The follow-up was 98.1% complete for a mean of 3.7 years/patient. Operative mortality was 11.1%; preoperative NYHA class and length of CPB were significant risk factors of perioperative mortality. The actuarial survival of operative survivors at 9 years was 73.5 +/- 11.8%. There were 7 late cardiac deaths among a total of 12 late deaths. Eleven patients required reoperation (2.1 +/- 0.6% patient-year). In seven patients it was necessary for recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation; six of these had also a mitral prosthesis malfunction or a periprosthetic leak. Residual tricuspid regurgitation was judged as mild, moderate or severe in 29.9%, 11.9% and 4.3% of the patients respectively. De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty is the method of choice for mild and moderate tricuspid insufficiency; in selected cases, with a more severe degree of regurgitation, better results could be achieved with a different surgical approach. 
1	Biliary and pancreatic metastases of breast carcinoma: is surgical palliation indicated? Obstructive jaundice developed in a patient concomitantly with the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Abdominal exploration disclosed a metastatic tumor in the head of the pancreas, the distal bile duct, and the gallbladder. A cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed and later, because of intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent gastrojejunostomy. Pathological examination demonstrated metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast with strongly positive staining for estradiol. Additional hormonal therapy has been given to the patient since the operation. The patient is alive 16 months after the diagnosis of her disease. This case suggests that a vigorous diagnostic approach should be adopted in every jaundiced patient with metastatic breast cancer in order to exclude causes of jaundice other than diffuse metastatic involvement of the liver. Patients with extrahepatic biliary metastasis should be treated by aggressive surgical treatment, combined with systemic therapy which can offer them significant palliation and better survival. 
5	A rodent model of cirrhosis, ascites, and bacterial peritonitis. We sought to develop a rodent model of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and report here the preliminary results of carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis in which ascites and bacterial peritonitis predictably develop. Of 41 rats that survived the initial carbon tetrachloride toxicity, 38 (92.7%) developed cirrhosis with ascites. Of these 38, 21 (55.3%) developed 24 episodes of ascitic fluid infection without iatrogenic colonization. No surgically treatable source of infection was identified at autopsy in any rat; therefore, the infections were presumed to be "spontaneous." Eight (50%) of the 16 rats with culture-positive ascitic fluid at postmortem examination also had spontaneous pleural fluid infection with the same organism. Escherichia coli and Proteus sp. were the organisms most commonly isolated. This rodent model of cirrhosis with ascites appears to be the first high-yield animal model of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascitic fluid infection in these rats resembles ascitic fluid infection in humans. This model will allow further investigation of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of ascitic fluid infection and provide insight into the prevention and treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and pleural fluid infection in patients with cirrhosis. 
4	Subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown etiology: early prognostic factors for long-term functional capacity. Forty-one patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown etiology were re-investigated at an average of 91 months after the bleed to determine functional capacity. Nineteen patients were performing at their previous level of work, five were employed part-time, and four could not work due to the SAH. Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review. 
2	Long-term results of the Belsey Mark IV antireflux operation in relation to the severity of esophagitis A retrospective analysis of the results of the Belsey Mark IV operation has been conducted, relating these to the degree of esophagitis present preoperatively. Analysis of 89 patients showed a 91.7% success rate in patients without esophagitis. Good results diminished steadily as the severity of esophagitis increased, giving 76.5%, 75%, 66.7%, and 50% success rates for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree esophagitis, respectively. We believe that shortening of the esophagus is an important factor in this. Shortening is obvious in third- and fourth-degree esophagitis but subtle in first- and second-degree esophagitis. We conclude that the Belsey operation is adequate for patients without esophagitis, but for patients with any degree of esophagitis more effective reflux control is needed. 
1	Effect of closing dead space on incidence of seroma after mastectomy. Seromas are a significant cause of morbidity after modified radical mastectomy. The effect of closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal (48 hours postoperatively) of closed suction drains on formation of the seroma was evaluated prospectively in 37 patients. Thirty-three underwent modified radical mastectomy for invasive carcinoma while four underwent total mastectomy with a level 1 axillary dissection for multifocal intraductal carcinoma. Seromas occurred in three, all were minor, two required one aspiration only and one required two aspirations. Two were seromas of the lower flap while one was an axillary seroma. Except for one patient who had a wound hematoma develop, no other instances of morbidity were noted. Closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal of closed suction drains is associated with a low incidence of seroma formation after mastectomy. Use of this technique has important economic and clinical implications for patients who had mastectomy. 
3	Anterior acromioplasty for treatment of the shoulder impingement syndrome. Between 1975 and 1979, anterior acromioplasty was performed in 65 patients with 66 involved shoulders. The procedure appears to be safe and reasonably effective. Of the 65 patients in this study, 50 had chronic tendon inflammation with fibrosis, and 16 also had a small supraspinatus tendon tear. These 16 had rotator cuff repairs. Twenty-six patients were also treated with distal clavicle excision, and seven had tenodesis of the long head of the biceps brachii. The average age of the patients was 50 years (range, 23-75 years). All patients were followed for an average of eight years (range, three to 13 years). At final evaluation, no or slight pain was present in 77% of the shoulders: 39 of 50 without tendon tearing and 12 of 16 with tendon tearing and repair. Active shoulder abduction averaged 167 degrees. Ninety-two percent returned to employment, including 18% with some job modification. Eighty-six percent returned to recreational athletics, 20% with some modification of activities. Seven patients had additional surgical treatment. The progression of rotator cuff disease is not always prevented, but the need for subsequent shoulder treatment generally decreases. 
5	Response of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome to treatment of associated small-cell lung carcinoma. We evaluated the outcome in 16 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with histologically verified small-cell carcinoma (SCC). Thirteen patients received specific tumor therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or resection) and most also received pharmacologic and immunologic treatment for LEMS. Seven of 11 patients surviving for more than 2 months after tumor therapy showed substantial neurologic improvement (1 patient being in complete remission at 7 years); in 3 of 11 improvement was transient. An EMG index of disease severity (compound muscle action potential amplitude in abductor digiti minimi) was significantly increased at final follow-up (p less than 0.01; n = 11). A pretreatment amplitude greater than 3.0 mV was a good prognostic sign. We conclude that a combined treatment approach in SCC-LEMS usually results in neurologic improvement. 
5	Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms. In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess. 
3	Progress report of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study recently found and reported (SPAF Investigators, N Engl J Med, 1990;322:863-868) a beneficial effect of both warfarin and aspirin compared with placebo in the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Among warfarin-eligible patients, the event rates were 1.6%/yr for those receiving active antithrombotic therapy (warfarin or aspirin) and 8.3%/yr for those receiving placebo (p less than 0.00005) (risk reduction 81%, 95% confidence interval 56-91). Ironically, we did not find a beneficial effect of aspirin in warfarin-ineligible patients. On the basis of these results, the study has been reshaped to directly compare these two antithrombotic agents. Insight into the apparent aspirin unresponsiveness noted in some patients also is being sought. Interpretation of the preliminary results and the reshaping of the study have been made more complex by the continued blinding of the investigators to certain portions of the data. Presented is an account of the study from its inception through its recent redesign. 
1	Choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal defects During a 4-year period, 83 pregnant women with fetal choroid plexus cysts were investigated in our unit. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 20 fetuses, including trisomy 18 (n = 16), trisomy 13 (n = 1), triploidy (n = 1) and translocation Down's syndrome (n = 2). All fetuses with chromosomal defects had structural malformations in addition to the choroid plexus cysts. 
5	Behavioral modification of colonic function. Can constipation be learned? We challenged the two hypotheses: first, that defecation can be suppressed for an extended time, and second, if so, that this has an effect on upper colonic motility. Thus we studied 12 male volunteers with conditions of identical nutrition and patterns of physical activity over a two-week period, where one week with normal defecation and one week with voluntary prolonged suppression of defecation followed each other in randomized order. Frequencies of defecation, stool weights, total and segmental colonic transit times (using radiopaque markers) were compared. Frequency of defecations and stool weights were lower during suppressed defecation [8.9 +/- 0.66 vs 3.7 +/- 0.41 (mean +/- SE) bowel movements per week, P = 0.003, and 1.30 +/- 0.09 vs 0.98 +/- 0.13 kg/week, P = 0.01]. Total transit times were increased from 28.8 +/- 4.4 to 53.1 +/- 4.3 hr, P = 0.004. Segmental transit times were increased in the rectosigmoid (from 8.83 +/- 3.6 to 32.1 +/- 5.6 hr, P = 0.04) and right hemicolon (from 14.5 +/- 0.9 hr to 19.7 +/- 1.5 hr, P = 0.02) by suppression of defecation. We conclude that defecation habits may induce changes in colonic function such as those seen in constipation and that functional anorectal outlet obstruction may, probably by reflex mediation, affect the right colon. 
3	Selective spatial attention in patients with visual extinction. The present study was designed to verify the attentional performance of patients with parietal lesions in the experimental condition in which they had to pay attention to 3 spatial positions located on the left, on the right and directly above the fixation stimulus (Experiment 1) and to only 1 of the 3 spatial positions at a time (Experiment 2). Twelve patients (6 subjects with right parietal lesions and 6 subjects without neurological deficits) participated in the experiment. The results of Experiment 1 showed that in patients with right parietal lesions the speed and accuracy of response to horizontally aligned stimuli increased gradually from right to left, whereas the control group showed only the effect due to the different retinal eccentricities of the 3 stimuli, that is, responses to central stimuli were faster and more accurate than responses to left and right stimuli. The results of Experiment 2 showed that both the neurological and control groups were faster to respond to central than to left and right stimuli, and that the neurological group was faster to respond to right than left stimuli, whereas no difference in RTs between two visual fields was obtained in the control group. Furthermore, when the patients had to respond to 3 spatial locations aligned horizontally (Experiment 1), the speed and accuracy of response to the right stimulus were the same as when they had to focus attention on it (Experiment 2). These results showed that the focus of attention in patients with visual extinction is on the rightmost stimulus and that the increased attention to the right is accompanied by a decreased attention to the left. 
1	Retroviral transformation of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells: macrophage-like and microvascular endothelial cell properties. We report that L-cell-conditioned medium (LCM) transforms porcine cerebral microvascular (PCMV) endothelial cells into cells with macrophage-like properties. LCM is known to contain both cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus, a murine retrovirus found in the L929 cell and LCM. Our evidence suggests that both LCM cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus are involved in this PCMV endothelial cell transformation. Criteria for transformation include focus formation, decreased serum requirements for growth, changes in morphology including nonadherence, propagation in suspension culture, and a decreased growth response to stimulation with a known endothelial cell mitogen. Macrophage-like characteristics of this transformed cell, designated as RVTE, include pinocytosis of low-density lipoprotein, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, phagocytosis of bacteria and zymosan, the expression of macrophage enzyme markers, and constitutive production of colony-stimulating factor 1. However, the transformed cell retains several properties of the nontransformed cell including the expression of FVIII:RAg and in vitro self-organization into capillary-like structures. Cloning of RVTE cells clearly shows that both macrophage-like and cerebral microvascular endothelial cell properties are present in the same cell. During self-organization, nontransformed cells express morphologic and functional characteristics classically associated with the macrophage. These findings suggest that some brain capillary pathophysiologies could involve macrophage-like cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, the "reticuloendothelial" phenotypic repertoire expressed by this transformed cerebral microvascular endothelial cell may show that the cerebral capillary endothelial cell in vivo is derived from a hematopoietic and/or phagocytic precursor. 
4	Tilt test for diagnosis of unexplained syncope in pediatric patients. Thirty-five teenage patients with a history of presyncope or syncope underwent a passive head-up tilting to reproduce symptoms of syncope. If tilting alone did not induce syncope, isoproterenol infusion was given to increase heart rate to 150 to 160 beats per minute. In 80% of patients with a history of syncope, identical symptoms could be reproduced during tilting: an abrupt fall in blood pressure combined with profound nodal bradycardia, ranging from 32 to 86 beats per minute. These symptoms were quickly reversed by returning the patient to the supine position. For patients with frequent occurrences of syncope, especially when there was a history of trauma sustained during these episodes, a therapeutic regimen of either beta blockers or 9 alpha-fluorocortisol was begun. The mechanisms of this common cause of syncope in childhood is neurocardiogenic in response to venous pooling and catecholamine-induced tachycardia. The tilt test is an excellent and cost-effective test for the workup of unexplained syncope in childhood. 
1	Metastatic tumors of the umbilicus: a review 1830-1989. Umbilical metastases from known and unknown primary cancers are rare. The eponym "Sister Mary Joseph's nodule" has been used by generations of physicians. The first reports of this clinical sign were from Walshe in 1846. A review of the literature revealed 265 cases from then until 1989. Only 85 cases of umbilical metastasis from unknown primary tumors were found. This review should help us to focus on the common and uncommon primary sites in the diagnosis of patients with this finding. A single case report and the work-up for the hidden primary tumor are described. 
3	Glossopharyngeal schwannoma: review of five cases and the literature. Glossopharyngeal schwannomas are rare tumors in spite of the fact that acoustic schwannomas account for 8%-10% of intracranial tumors. There have been 23 reported cases in the literature. This report of five cases is the largest series of these tumors. The presentation, radiological workup, operation, and long-term postoperative results will be presented, along with a review of the literature. 
5	Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia. 
4	Correction of truncus arteriosus with truncal valvar stenosis or insufficiency using two homografts. Surgical correction of truncus arteriosus requires the creation of right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity and closure of the ventricular septal defect. A variety of conduits have been used including valved and nonvalved. Despite a significant incidence of truncal valvar stenosis and insufficiency, this valve has seldom been replaced. We present 4 cases of truncus arteriosus with truncal valvar stenosis or insufficiency that were repaired using two valved homografts: one to create the pulmonary outflow tract and the other to replace the abnormal truncal valve. Two of these patients are doing well after 4 months. Another child survived the operation and did well for 2 months when she died suddenly. The last child died 14 hours postoperatively from low cardiac output syndrome secondary to diabetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When truncal valvar abnormalities are present, the primary repair of truncus arteriosus in an infant should include replacement of the truncal valve. Total correction can be successfully achieved using two valved homografts, resulting in long-term palliation and freedom from thromboembolic events and the use of anticoagulants. 
5	A dentofacial deformity associated with incontinentia pigmenti: report of a case. A case of IP in a 16-year-old girl has been presented. This patient manifested classic ectodermal and mesodermal anomalies. We present this case to illustrate a rare etiologic factor in the development of dentofacial deformities that can be treated in the conventional manner. 
4	The effects of benazepril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in mild to moderate essential hypertension: a multicenter study. Benazepril hydrochloride is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In a multicenter study, 206 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to receive benazepril at a dose of 2, 5, 10, or 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. The 20 mg dosage of benazepril lowered blood pressure to a degree equal to that of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide: -12.2/7.7 mm Hg and -13.4/-7.5 mm Hg, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide proved to be more effective in black subjects. At lower dosage levels of benazepril (2, 5, and 10 mg), blood pressure reduction was not significantly different from that with placebo. In those patients who failed to achieve goal diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg with monotherapy after 4 weeks, the addition of open-label hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) to benazepril, hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo produced a substantial additional decrease in blood pressure over a 2-week period. No definite adverse effects on hematologic measurements, serum biochemistry test results, or urinalyses were noted. Subjective adverse experiences were common in all groups but except in three or possibly four instances were not considered causally related to the study drug. 
1	Low doses of IL-4 injected perilymphatically in tumor-bearing mice inhibit the growth of poorly and apparently nonimmunogenic tumors and induce a tumor-specific immune memory. The ability of rIL-4 to trigger host reactivity against both a chemically induced fibrosarcoma (CE-2) and a spontaneous adenocarcinoma (TS/A) of BALB/c mice was studied. Daily local s.c. administration around tumor draining lymph nodes of 10 injections of progressive amounts (0.00001 to 1000 pg/day) of rIL-4 induced appreciable inhibition of the growth of both tumors after a dose-response survival curve peaking at 0.1 pg/day. Inasmuch as rIL-4 has no direct antitumor activity, as shown by in vitro tests, host immune reactivity plays a fundamental role in this lymphokine activated tumor inhibition (LATI). LATI, in fact, is abolished when recipient mice are sublethally irradiated or treated with cyclosporin A, or when the reactivity of CD4+ lymphocytes is suppressed, whereas it is not affected by anti-asialo GM1 antibody. The morphologic data show that rIL-4 LATI rests on the recruitment of several cell reaction mechanisms, among which those that are nonspecific seem to predominate. rIL-4 LATI also leads to a state of long lasting and specific immune memory: the growth of a second contralateral tumor challenge is significantly impaired after LATI. This immune memory takes place after LATI of both the poorly immunogenic CE-2 fibrosarcoma and the TS/A adenocarcinoma, previously classed as nonimmunogenic on the basis of immunization-protection tests. In the latter case, adoptive transfer experiments show that Thy-1+ lymphocytes and, in particular, the CD4 cell-depleted T lymphocyte subpopulation, are responsible for the immune memory. Finally, the ability of rIL-4 to trigger LATI is greater than that of the most effective doses of rIL-2, rIL-1 beta, and IFN-gamma, whereas its association with rIL-1 beta induces a more effective immune memory. 
4	Can heart failure be prevented, delayed, or reversed? A review of the clinical course of chronic heart failure demonstrates that current outcomes remain highly unsatisfactory both in mortality and perhaps more important in morbidity. The extraordinary satisfactory functional responses seen in patients who undergo cardiac transplantation clearly identify the primary cause as the status of the heart itself, whatever the pathophysiologic adjustments of the neuroendocrine system, and interventions of the wide variety of drugs. Since donor hearts are unlikely to be available even from younger sufferers of these clinical syndromes, prevention must be the hallmark. Protection of the viability of myocytes, such as in acute myocarditis and acute infarction, is essential. Myocardial collagen undergoes continual synthesis, and production is greatly stimulated in the presence of hypertrophy caused by increased wall stress. It is possible that excess collagen is intimately involved with diastolic ventricular dysfunction, but that this may be a reversible process if the collagen-producing stimulus is removed. Thus reduction in wall stress and reversibility of ventricular hypertrophy appear to be promising directions. However, to limit the catastrophic effects of chronic heart failure, early recognition of the precursors of these syndromes, prevention of progression, and surgical intervention in valvular heart disease at an optimal point in time are essential. 
5	Anal ulcerations due to cytomegalovirus in patients with AIDS. Report of six cases. Lesions due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) are frequent in the immunocompromised patient. This is particularly the case in patients with AIDS, where the colon and rectum are the regions most often involved. The authors report six cases of anal ulcerations due to CMV in patients with AIDS. These lesions, confirmed histologically, were either isolated or associated with other localizations. Treatment is based on specific antiviral agents but resistance and recurrence can occur. The current report underlines the importance of histologic examination of anal lesions in HIV-infected subjects. 
1	Endothelin-like immunoreactivity in human breast cyst fluid. Immunoreactive endothelin has been detected in 21 of 43 samples of breast cyst fluid (21 cases; 3.5 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, mean +/- SEM. Other 22 cases; not detectable, less than 0.5 pmol/l). Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis of the immunoreactive endothelin of pooled breast cyst fluid showed two immunoreactive peaks; one in the void volume and the other in the position of endothelin-1. It is probable that endothelin-1 is produced by the epithelial cells lining breast cysts, but significance of the presence of endothelin-1 in breast cyst fluid remains to be elucidated. 
5	Treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head by drilling and muscle-pedicle bone grafting. Sixty-one patients with 68 osteonecrotic femoral heads, at different stages of development, were treated surgically; their average age was 36 years. Necrosis followed a fracture in 43 hips and traumatic dislocation in three. It was idiopathic in 14, cortisone-induced in seven and associated with gout in one. The operation of multiple drilling, curettage of the necrotic bone and muscle pedicle bone grafting was performed in all. Cheilectomy of the superolateral part of the femoral head and adductor tenotomy were added in cases of advanced necrosis. Of the several types of muscle pedicle used, tensor fasciae latae anteriorly and quadratus femoris posteriorly were preferred. Full weight-bearing was not permitted for five to six months. The follow-up period varied from three to 12 years. Hip pain was regularly relieved and abduction and rotation of the joints were improved. Those with post-traumatic or idiopathic necrosis did better than those with cortisone-induced necrosis. 
5	Lidocaine local anesthesia for arthroscopic knee surgery. Forty-five patients were evaluated during knee arthroscopy performed using local anesthesia produced by lidocaine with epinephrine to determine the dose-response relationship for operative analgesia. Serum lidocaine concentrations were also measured. Patients were randomized prospectively to receive 20 mL of 0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine intraarticularly. Intraoperative discomfort was measured by verbal response on an 11-point linear pain scale. Pain scores were significantly higher in patients receiving 0.5% lidocaine during the first 45 min of surgery (P = 0.03). After 45 min, pain scores continued to be higher in the 0.5% lidocaine group than in the 1.0% or 1.5% groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. Ninety-four percent of patients in the 1.5% lidocaine group were willing to repeat this anesthetic technique for surgery compared with 83% of those in the 1.0% lidocaine group and 75% of those in the 0.5% lidocaine group (P greater than 0.05). The duration of postoperative analgesia was similar in all groups. Serum lidocaine concentrations before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after instillation of lidocaine were highest in the 1.5% lidocaine group with a peak concentration of 278 ng/mL. No patient had symptoms of lidocaine toxicity. We recommend that lidocaine concentrations of 1.0% or 1.5% be used when 20 mL is instilled intraarticularly for knee arthroscopy based on patient comfort and absence of lidocaine toxicity. 
1	Treatment of spinal cord compression by epidural malignancy in childhood. Epidural spinal cord compression by a malignant tumor is a rare occurrence in children. Both the tumors involved and the extent of involvement of the vertebral column are different in children and adults. Often, the epidural tumor in a child is identified before significant spinal canal compromise has occurred, and these children frequently can be managed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. There is a group of children, however, who have severe spinal canal encroachment by a tumor, as evidenced by a near complete or complete block on myelography. In this study, we report a group of patients with severe spinal cord compression, as documented by imaging studies. We compared the results of a decompressive laminectomy and subtotal tumor resection followed by adjuvant therapy with the results obtained with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy alone. Thirty-three patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Twenty-six were treated with a laminectomy and adjuvant therapy, and 7 were treated without surgical intervention. With surgical therapy, 25 of 26 epidurals were either improved or stable, whereas 4 of 7 nonsurgical patients deteriorated. Especially notable was a decrease in pain in the operative patients immediately after their procedure. There was no surgical mortality or morbidity. The results of this study indicate that children with severe spinal cord compression as evidenced by a near complete or complete block on myelography or filling of 50% or more of the spinal canal on magnetic resonance imaging are best treated by a combination of surgical decompression and tumor removal followed by adjuvant therapy. 
5	Results and complications of angioplasty in fibromuscular disease. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was used to treat 66 patients with 85 renal artery stenoses due to fibromuscular dysplasia. The hypertension was refractory to medical management in 46 patients, and the initial success rate was 100%. Clinical follow-up has been obtained in all patients, who were followed for as long as 121 months. The recurrence rates were 8% of lesions and 10% of patients. Cumulative patency rate predicted for 10 years was 87.07%. The mean systolic pressure decreased by 52 mm Hg and the mean diastolic pressure decreased by 35 mm Hg in response to treatment. Twenty-six patients (39%) were cured, 39 (59%) were classified as improved, and one (2%) did not respond to PTA. Fourteen of the patients also had elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Renal function was improved in 86% of the patients and stabilized in 14% of the patients. Analysis of the long-term results suggests that PTA should be the initial treatment for choice of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia in the renal arteries. 
4	The iris in Williams syndrome. Forty three children with Williams syndrome and 124 control subjects had their eyes photographed. The photographs were examined by three ophthalmologists and four geneticists of varying experience. A stellate pattern was noted more often in the irides of patients with Williams syndrome (51%) than in those of the control subjects (12%), and was more difficult to detect, or was absent, in heavily pigmented irides. We conclude that the stellate pattern is of diagnostic importance, particularly if the pattern is carefully defined and the clinician is experienced. 
5	Plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentration determination in patients with diarrhea. Determination of plasma levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been used for screening patients with chronic diarrhea to identify potential neuroendocrine tumors. This 6-year blinded study from 1981 to 1986 examines the causes of elevated VIP levels in patients. In healthy volunteers ( n = 144), VIP concentrations ranged from 14 to 76 pg/mL (mean +/- SE, 28 +/- 12), whereas in chronic renal failure, 4 of 34 patients or 12% [serum creatinine 4.5 - 9.0 mg/dL (397-795 mumols/L)] had an elevation to greater than 100 pg/mL. No patient with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis (n = 12) had elevation of serum concentration of this peptide. Among 588 consecutive unselected patients undergoing evaluation for chronic diarrhea (n = 362; 62%) or possible neuroendocrine tumor (n = 214; 36%), 23 patients (3.9%) had concentrations greater than 76 pg/mL. In this group, 5 patients had functioning (VIP, 160-5975 pg/mL) and 5 had nonfunctioning (VIP, 80-120 pg/mL) pancreatic islet cell carcinomas: all 10 patients had hepatic metastases. Other known cases of elevated levels of VIP, ranging from 80 to 340 pg/mL, included other neurogenic tumors (n = 3), small- bowel resection (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2), chronic renal failure (n = 1), and prolonged fasting (n = 1). Patients with diarrhea in which VIP-secreting tumors were identified had plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations greater than 140 pg/mL. In patients with chronic diarrhea, determination of plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide levels did identify tumors secreting this peptide, but the results from this referral institution did not show identification of these tumors early in their clinical course. 
2	Association of autoimmune hepatitis with HLA-Bw54 and DR4 in Japanese patients. Human leukocyte antigen-D region-related alleles (human leukocyte antigen DR and DQ) and human leukocyte antigen class I alleles were typed serologically in 31 Japanese patients with autoimmune hepatitis. These patients had increased serum levels of AST and IgG, high titers of autoantibodies, no history of blood transfusion and were negative for HBsAg and antibodies to HBc. Three hundred eighty-six healthy subjects and 30 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis served as control groups. The frequency of DR4 was significantly higher in autoimmune hepatitis patients (90.3%) than in healthy subjects (38.6%) and in cryptogenic chronic hepatitis patients (30%). The frequency of Bw54 was significantly higher in autoimmune hepatitis patients (45.2%) than in healthy subjects (10.9%). The risk to DR4-positive subjects for autoimmune hepatitis was 14.8 relative to healthy subjects. Two of 31 patients (6.5%) with autoimmune hepatitis were positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus; both clearly satisfied criteria for autoimmune hepatitis and both had Bw54 and DR4. This study revealed a highly significant association of autoimmune hepatitis with human leukocyte antigen Bw54 and DR4 in Japanese patients. Among the DR4-positive patients with autoimmune hepatitis, no significant differences were seen between those positive or negative for Bw54 with regard to clinical or laboratory data, relapse of disease or efficacy of prednisolone. Thus human leukocyte antigen class II alleles contribute to susceptibility and resistance to autoimmune hepatitis in Japanese patients, with distinct racial differences from those in white patients. 
5	Nasal reconstruction with articulated irradiated rib cartilage. Nasal structural reconstruction is a formidable task in cases where there is loss of support to both the nasal dorsum and tip. A multitude of surgical approaches and materials have been used for the correction of the saddle-nose deformity with varying degrees of success. Articulated irradiated rib cartilage inserted through an external rhinoplasty approach was used to reconstruct nasal deformities in 18 patients over a 6-year period. Simultaneous use of a midline forehead flap to reconstruct the overlying soft tissue was required in four cases. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 2.8 years). Results were rewarding in most cases with marked improvement in nasal support and airway. Revision and/or replacement secondary to trauma or warping of the graft was required in four cases. None of the patients exhibited infection, extrusion, or noticeable resorption. A description of the surgical technique, review of all the cases, and recommendation for continued use of this graft material are discussed. 
5	A prospective analysis of 1518 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The Southern Surgeons Club. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The Southern Surgeons Club conducted a prospective study of 1518 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treatment of gallbladder disease in order to evaluate the safety of this procedure. RESULTS. Seven hundred fifty-eight operations (49.9 percent) were performed at academic hospitals, and 760 (50.1 percent) at private hospitals. In 72 patients (4.7 percent) the operation was converted to conventional open cholecystectomy; the most common reason for the change was the inability to identify the anatomy of the gallbladder as a result of inflammation in the region of this organ. A total of 82 complications occurred in 78 (5.1 percent) of the patients; this is comparable with the rates of 6 to 21 percent that have been reported for conventional cholecystectomy. Overall, the most common complication was superficial infection of the site of insertion of the umbilical trocar. A total of seven injuries to the common bile duct or the hepatic duct occurred during the operation, for a rate of 0.5 percent. Four of the seven injuries were simple lacerations, which were repaired after conversion to conventional cholecystectomy. The incidence of bile-duct injury in the first 13 patients operated on by each surgical group was 2.2 percent, as compared with 0.1 percent for subsequent patients. No complications were attributed directly to either cautery or laser-surgical technique, and similar numbers of complications occurred in academic and private hospitals. The mean hospital stay for the entire group was 1.2 days (range, 6 hours to 30 days). CONCLUSIONS. The results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy compare favorably with those of conventional cholecystectomy with respect to mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay. A slightly higher incidence of biliary injury with the laparoscopic procedure is probably offset by the low incidence of other complications. 
1	Oral manifestations of HIV infection and their management. I. More common lesions. Oral lesions are common at all stages of HIV infection. This first of two articles reviews the clinical features and pathogenesis of common oral manifestations of HIV disease (candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma, and HIV-related periodontal disease) and considers current treatment measures. 
5	Chronic anal fissure. A new method of treatment by anoplasty. Chronic anal fissure is a common condition usually treated by maximal anal dilatation or lateral subcutaneous sphincterotomy. The following method is based on a common surgical principal; to widen a stenosed tube a longitudinal incision is made across the stenosed area and this is sutured transversely as in pyloroplasty. This method of anoplasty is simple and appears to have no resultant complications. Further studies are necessary before its value can be established compared to the presently accepted methods of treatment. 
2	Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and elevated serum pepsinogen I levels in smokers and nonsmokers. We determined serum pepsinogen I (PG I) levels by radioimmunoassay in 472 patients with duodenal ulcer and 141 normal subjects to investigate whether serum PG I levels were related to cigarette smoking, and in 225 patients to determine whether the recurrence of duodenal ulcer was related to serum PG I levels or cigarette smoking. Serum PG I levels were not influenced by cigarette smoking in either patients with duodenal ulcer or normal subjects. The recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer not under maintenance therapy was significantly higher in hyperPG I patients than in normoPG I patients, regardless of their smoking habits. Only in hyperPG I patients was the recurrence rate in smokers higher than in nonsmokers. Patients under maintenance therapy showed similar results. Multilogistic regression indicated that hyperPG I had a greater effect than cigarette smoking on ulcer recurrence. These findings indicate that serum PG I levels are not influenced by smoking, and the important characteristic in patients with recurrent duodenal ulcers is the increased serum PG I levels. 
1	Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in primary uveal melanoma. We report on 14 cases of clonal chromosomal anomalies in patients with primary uveal melanoma. An increased dosage of chromosome 8 or of parts of the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q) were detected in eight patients (57%). The smallest multiplied area of 8q appeared to be the region 8q2.1----qter. Monosomy of chromosome 3 was seen in six patients (43%), five of which were associated with anomalies of chromosome 8. Increased dosage of parts of chromosome 8q and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3, or the combination of both, seemed to be nonrandom for uveal melanoma and may distinguish it genetically from cutaneous malignant melanoma. Anomalies of chromosome 6, mostly resulting in additional material of 6p or a deletion of 6q, were found in six patients (43%). These anomalies, which seem to be common features of cutaneous malignant melanoma, were considered secondary rather than primary changes in uveal melanoma, since they were present only in subclones in most cases. Loss of the Y chromosome, restricted to tumor cells, was detected in four male patients, and loss of one X chromosome was detected in a female patient. 
3	Antiepileptic drugs, cognitive function, and behavior in children: evidence from recent studies. The effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognitive function and behavior in children are reviewed on the basis of published studies. Individual AEDs have been shown to differ--the deleterious effects of phenytoin generally contrasting with the relatively minimal effects of valproate and carbamazepine. Some of the differences between results may be attributed to the psychological tests used and to age differences. However, there appears to be a dissociation between AEDs that affect higher cognitive function, e.g., phenytoin, and those mainly affecting motor function, e.g., carbamazepine, which appears to increase speed of performance, AEDs should be prescribed with care in children with epilepsy, taking account of their differing effects on cognitive function and behavior. 
5	Squamous metaplasia of the peritoneum. The capacity of the peritoneal serosa to undergo metaplasia to mullerian-type epithelium is well recognized. We report a case of squamous metaplasia of the peritoneum that was studied by light microscopy. Immunohistochemical techniques, and electron microscopy. The pathogenesis of peritoneal squamous metaplasia is obscure, but may be a response to chronic irritation. 
2	Monitoring enzyme replacement treatment in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency using the cholesteryl octanoate breath test. The cholesteryl-14C-octanoate breath test was used to monitor the intraluminal enzymatic activity of pancreatin preparations in six patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency. Conventional enzyme replacement, with cimetidine as an adjunct, was compared to supplementation with enteric coated microspheres. In healthy control subjects, 14CO2 excretion rose rapidly and peaked at 90-120 minutes; mean (SD) cumulative recovery at four hours was 51 (8)%. In patients with pancreatic insufficiency on no treatment mean (SD) cumulative recovery was only 6 (4)%. After pancreatin, with previous administration of cimetidine, it increased to 27 (11)% with a time course resembling that in controls. With 2 mm enteric coated microspheres, 14CO2 excretion did not rise significantly before 120 minutes and cumulative recovery after four hours was 15 (11)%. In a control study, 2 mm radio-opaque microspheres did not empty from the stomach until two hours after ingestion. The results suggest that the cholesteryl octanoate breath test can be successfully used to monitor the intraluminal enzymatic activity after treatment with different forms of enzyme replacement in pancreatic insufficiency. In contrast to treatment with conventional pancreatin and cimetidine as an adjunct, 2 mm enteric coated microspheres did not show in vivo enzymatic activity until two hours after administration. 
2	Audit of results of operations for infantile pyloric stenosis in a district general hospital Because of the proposal that infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should only be treated by surgeons with an interest in paediatric surgery, we carried out a retrospective study to audit our experience in a district general hospital. Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding. 
5	Emergency department diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of the history and physical examination as compared to the addition of serum progesterone screening for ectopic pregnancy in women presenting to the emergency department. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive case series, N = 2,157. SETTING: ED of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, a publicly subsidized, 450-bed acute care hospital staffed by residents and faculty of the University of Tennessee, Memphis. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All ED patients with a positive urine pregnancy test treated between January 1 and December 31, 1988. INTERVENTIONS: Screening history, physical examination, and serum progesterone (P) and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) titer. MEASUREMENTS: All discharged patients were given follow-up appointments within two weeks; those found to have a P less than 25 ng/mL were called to return for repeat hCG and transvaginal ultrasound. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one of 2,157 patients (7.5%) with a positive urine pregnancy test were found to have an ectopic pregnancy. All but five had a P of less than 25 ng/mL (sensitivity, 97%); four of these were admitted for immediate surgery because of symptoms. Overall, the ED physician detected 89 of 161 ectopics (55.3%) on initial presentation, 53 (60%) of which were ruptured at the time of surgery. Seventy-two patients (44.7%) who were discharged but later found to have an ectopic pregnancy had benign clinical presentations, including 41 with vaginal bleeding. There were no statistically significant differences in the presenting symptoms of patients with unruptured ectopics compared with normal intrauterine pregnancies. All but one of the 72 discharged patients were noted the following day to have a progesterone of less than 25 ng/mL and contacted to return. Eight of these were found to have a ruptured ectopic at the time of surgery. Only 91 of 161 patients (56.5%) with ectopic pregnancy acknowledged one or more clinical risk factors on follow-up questioning. CONCLUSION: The standard history and physical examination, including those performed by gynecologic specialists, are insufficiently sensitive for early detection of unruptured ectopic pregnancy. EDs with a high incidence of ectopic pregnancy should strongly consider implementation of a universal progesterone screening program to decrease unnecessary patient morbidity and the risk of mortality from undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy. 
4	Treatment of hypertension in the elderly: effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and physical fitness. The subjects were 36 hypertensive patients aged 61 to 79 years (mean, 66 years). After a placebo run-in period of one month, each patient was randomly assigned to two months of treatment with 100 mg of metoprolol, 50 mg of captopril, or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide plus 2.5 mg of amiloride daily, or placebo. The doses were doubled if diastolic pressure was above 95 mm Hg after one month of treatment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and physical fitness (endurance during a standard cycle ergometer exercise) were measured and side effects assessed after each two-month treatment period. Mean blood pressures were significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (154/92 mm Hg), captopril (157/92 mm Hg), and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (152/91 mm Hg) than after placebo (170/101 mm Hg). Heart rate was significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (64 beats/minute) than after placebo (77 beats/minute). Exercise endurance was lower after treatment with metoprolol (498 seconds) and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (519 seconds) than after placebo (529 seconds) and higher after captopril (541 seconds). More patients reached the target exercise work load after captopril than after the other treatments. No patients withdrew from treatment because of side effects or abnormal laboratory test results. All three active treatments benefited the elderly hypertensive patients and did not lower their physical fitness. Captopril appeared to be more effective than the other two treatments. 
2	Small bile duct abnormalities in sarcoidosis. We report four patients with hepatic involvement of sarcoidosis manifested primarily by bile duct depletion. The patients developed fever, weight loss, anorexia, a markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase, and mildly abnormal serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed slight intrahepatic irregularities but were not diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis. Liver biopsy showed predominantly bile duct depletion, ranging from an estimated 10-100% absence of bile ducts in portal areas, which correlated with the degree of fibrosis. The degree of bile duct depletion is useful as a histological marker in patients with sarcoid liver disease. Steroids improve symptoms, but do not inhibit the development of "ductopenia.". 
5	A detachable balloon procedure for a traumatic internal carotid-internal jugular fistula: report of a case A case of a traumatic fistula between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein is reported. The fistula was treated by detachable balloon occlusion and clipping of the internal carotid artery. 
1	Familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia complicated by cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. A 55-year-old man with cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex was found to have reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol, betalipoprotein and apolipoprotein B. Computed tomography revealed atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem. Of the six family members examined, four had hypobetalipoproteinaemia, and one had mild ataxia. Similar skin lesions were noted in five male relatives. This case represents a rare combination of familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia, cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. 
5	Long-term results following surgical management of aortic graft infection. Between January 1970 and June 1988, a total of 45 patients with aortic prosthetic graft infection underwent removal of the infected aortic prosthesis. In addition, 36 of these patients also underwent revascularization via an extra-anatomic bypass. We analyzed the early and long-term results with respect to survival, limb salvage, freedom from infection, and extra-anatomic graft patency. The 30-day mortality was 24% (11/45), and the amputation rate was 11% (8/73). During a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 2 to 144 months), 80% (24/30) of the patients remained free of infection and are considered cured. Infection in the extra-anatomic bypass graft was the most common cause of recurrent sepsis and the leading cause of late amputations (four of seven). By life-table methods, 1-year survival was 63% and 5-year survival was 49%. Limb salvage rates at 1 and 5 years were 79% and 66%, respectively. The primary patency rate of extra-anatomic bypass was 43% at 3 years, with the secondary patency rate improved to 65%. These early and late results are in marked contrast to the natural history of untreated aortic graft infection. Nonetheless, a perioperative mortality rate of 24%, a 5-year limb loss rate of 33%, and 3-year graft thrombosis rate of 35% are testimony to the serious nature of aortic graft infection and the need to develop better methods to prevent this complication. 
2	Reduction of gastric ulcer recurrence after suppression of Helicobacter pylori by cefixime. The effect on the recurrence of gastric ulcers after suppression of Helicobacter pylori by combined treatment with cimetidine and the antimicrobial drug cefixime was investigated. Twenty one of 43 patients with endoscopically proved gastric ulcer and H pylori infection were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine 800 mg daily for 12 weeks; the remaining 22 patients received cimetidine 800 mg daily for 12 weeks plus cefixime 100 mg daily for the last two weeks. After treatment, 88% of 17 patients on cimetidine only remained H pylori positive, whereas combined administration of cimetidine and cefixime had suppressed H pylori in 78% of 18 patients (p less than 0.05). Seventeen patients in the former group whose ulcers healed but who remained H pylori positive and 18 patients in the latter group whose ulcers healed and who were no longer infected with H pylori continued to be followed after treatment. These patients underwent endoscopy to detect ulcer recurrence if symptomatic, or at 12 and 24 weeks if asymptomatic. At 12 weeks, recurrence was observed in seven of 15 (47%) patients in whom H pylori persisted, but in only one of 14 (7%) patients in whom H pylori had been suppressed (p less than 0.05). At 24 weeks, however, recurrence rates were similar between the two groups. These findings indicate that H pylori infection may be closely related to early ulcer recurrence.
