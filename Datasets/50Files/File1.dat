4	Catheterization laboratory events and hospital outcome with direct angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction To assess the safety of direct infarct angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy, catheterization laboratory and hospital events were assessed in consecutively treated patients with infarctions involving the left anterior descending (n = 100 patients), right (n = 100), and circumflex (n = 50) coronary arteries. The groups of patients were similar for age (left anterior descending coronary artery, 59 years; right coronary artery, 58 years; circumflex coronary artery, 62 years), patients with multivessel disease (left anterior descending coronary artery, 55%; right coronary artery, 55%; circumflex coronary artery, 64%), and patients with initial grade 0/1 antegrade flow (left anterior descending coronary artery, 79%; right coronary artery, 84%; circumflex coronary artery, 90%). Cardiogenic shock was present in eight patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, four with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery. Major catheterization laboratory events (cardioversion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dopamine or intra-aortic balloon pump support for hypotension, and urgent surgery) occurred in 10 patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, eight with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery (16 of 16 shock and six of 234 nonshock patients, p less than 0.001). There was one in-laboratory death (shock patient with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery). 
5	Renal abscess in children. Three cases of renal abscesses in children are described to illustrate the variable presenting features. An additional 23 pediatric cases, reported over the past ten years, were reviewed for clinical features and therapy. Fever, loin pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but less than half of all abscesses were associated with either an abnormal urinalysis or a positive urine culture. The presenting features were sometimes confused with appendicitis, peritonitis, or a Wilms tumor. An organism was identified in 17 cases--Escherichia coli in 9 children and Staphylococcus aureus in 8 children. The majority of E. coli infections occurred in girls and the majority of S. aureus infections occurred in boys. Reflux was documented in 5 patients, and 2 children had a possible extrarenal source of infection. Antibiotics alone produced a cure in 10 children (38%), but 16 children (62%) required a surgical procedure. 
2	Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps. 
5	Subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula after insertion of a hemodialysis catheter. Insertion of hemodialysis catheters for temporary use is now preferentially performed by percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization. This method involves passage of a stiff dilator and a peel-away sheath over a guide wire, and is usually carried out without fluoroscopy. For the most part this has proved to be a valuable and safe approach. However, a small incidence of major complications occurs, which needs to be emphasized. Sixteen cases of arteriovenous fistulas between the subclavian artery or its branches and the subclavian vein have been reported so far in the literature. To date only one case of subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula has been reported. We report the second case with this complication and suggest possible preventive measures. 
4	Effect of local inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake in the dorsomedial hypothalamus on extracellular levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and on stress-induced tachycardia: a study using microdialysis. Previous studies involving local microinjection of drugs that interfere with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition have led to the suggestion that endogenous GABA suppresses the activity of a sympatho-excitatory mechanism in the dorsomedial hypothalamus in rats. In this study, microdialysis was used to assess and to alter pharmacologically extracellular-levels of GABA within this region while simultaneously monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. In anesthetized rats, local microdialysis for 15 min with 2.5, 10 and 40 mM nipecotic acid, an inhibitor of GABA uptake, caused concentration-related increases in GABA and taurine in the extracellular space, but no significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure. Similar perfusion with 37.5, 75 and 150 mM KCl caused concentration-related increases in GABA as well as aspartate, glutamate, taurine, glycine and alanine. Only modest, variable increases in heart rate and no effect on arterial pressure were observed during the perfusions with high potassium. In conscious rats, unilateral microdialysis of the dorsomedial hypothalamus with 0.5 mM nipecotic acid for 2 to 2.5 hr before stress coupled with contralateral microinjection of muscimol (88 pmol/250 nl) 5 min before stress significantly reduced air stress-induced tachycardia; this reduction in tachycardia was associated with markedly elevated levels of GABA in dialysates collected from the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Neither treatment alone significantly influenced stress-induced increases in heart rate, although perfusion with nipecotic acid alone evoked similar elevations in extracellular GABA. These results suggest that extracellular levels of endogenous GABA in the dorsomedial hypothalamus may regulate the cardiovascular response to stress. 
1	Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established. 
5	Mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap after resection of carcinoma of the esophagus involving the proximal part of the trachea. An operative procedure of mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is presented. In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap. Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea. In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma. A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three. In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap. However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap. Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea. 
5	Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion of the extremity. Report of a case and review of the literature. Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion is an idiopathic fibroinflammatory process of the head and neck region. Although benign histopathologically, it is invasive, destructive, and locally recurrent, leading to uncertainty regarding its proper management; as the disease is rare, determining optimal treatment is difficult, given the anecdotal nature of reports. We report the first case of a tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion occurring outside the head and neck region. Our patient was treated with corticosteroids and had a favorable response, supporting this approach as initial treatment. Immunohistochemical studies performed on a pretreatment specimen were consistent with a secondary inflammatory component because no monoclonal nor aberrant phenotypes were detected. The tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion appears to be indistinguishable from the other known idiopathic fibroinflammatory processes; patients presenting with any one of these should be evaluated for the others. 
3	Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia. Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge. 
5	Increasing asthma prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89. A survey of asthma symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years. 
5	Usefulness of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in improving survival of patients with severely depressed left ventricular function associated with coronary artery disease. Clinical outcome was analyzed among a group of 39 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions less than 30% and arrhythmias that required an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in an attempt to better define the role of the device in patients with severely depressed LV function. Twenty-nine (74%) were survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 10 (26%) had ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy. The study group had the following demographic characteristics: 90% were men, mean age was 64 years (range 41 to 79) and mean LV ejection fraction was 21 +/- 4%. Concomitant pharmacotherapy included antiarrhythmic drugs 31 (79%), vasodilators in 22 (56%) and digoxin in 20 (51%). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months (range 2 to 72) from implantation. The difference between actuarial survival--77% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years--and projected survival without the AICD (patients who survive without appropriate device discharge)--30% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years--was significant (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.05 at 1 and 2 years, respectively). This study suggests that the AICD improves survival in patients with coronary artery disease despite severely depressed LV function. 
5	Stress-related mucosal damage: review of drug therapy. The increased awareness of stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD) that accompanied the widespread use of fiberoptic endoscopy and the increased incidence of SRMD that accompanied the advances in caring for critically ill patients resulted in the recognition that the majority of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting wil develop mucosal damage. Complications of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in these patients may contribute significantly to their morbidity and mortality, and the consequences of this bleeding may be more severe than the underlying predisposing conditions. Because of the importance of gastric acid in the pathogenesis of SRMD, therapy has focused on reduction of the intraluminal acid concentration. Acid neutralization, while effective, is laborious and associated with side effects. H2-receptor antagonists have been used successfully in the prophylaxis and treatment of SRMD and offer the potential for an effective parenteral as well as oral agent. They obviate the need for frequent antacid administration and eliminate some of the troubles and side effects that accompany an intensive antacid regimen. Of the available H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine has been the most thoroughly evaluated. It is equivalent to antacids in the prevention of overt bleeding and offers the advantage of dosing flexibility, ease of administration, and a remarkable safety profile. Cimetidine has also been shown to be effective when administered by intermittent bolus infusions given every 8, 6, or 4 h or by primed continuous infusion, which has proven to be the most successful method of controlling intragastric pH. 
2	A biphasic pattern of anti-pre-S responses in acute hepatitis B virus infection. The clinical relevance of the immune response to the translation products of the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of hepatitis B virus was examined by testing sequential serum samples from 17 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B and from two patients in whom chronic liver disease developed. Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution. 
5	A controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease. 
5	Pentostatin induces durable remissions in hairy cell leukemia. Fifty patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; dCF) for a median of 3 months; 32 (64%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 10 (20%) patients achieved partial remission (PR), for an overall response rate of 84%. After reaching maximal response, no maintenance therapy was administered. The median duration of follow-up is now 39 months, and only four of 32 patients in CR and two of 10 patients in PR have relapsed. dCF therapy produces durable long-term, disease-free survival in patients with hairy cell leukemia. 
5	Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated "insular" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. 
1	Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. 
5	Steal-prone coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia associated with four primary anesthetic agents in humans. To examine the relationship between myocardial ischemia in patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy and the administration of isoflurane anesthesia, we reviewed coronary angiograms of 955 patients who had participated in a randomized trial of the use of one of four primary anesthetics for coronary artery bypass operations. Steal-prone anatomy was found in 31.8% of patients who had received enflurane; 40.0%, halothane; 32.6%, isoflurane; and 31.7%, sufentanil. Detected by greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST segment displacement, ischemia during anesthesia occurred in 290 (30.4%) of all patients with no difference in the incidence among the four primary anesthetics (27.5%-32.9%). Patients with steal-prone anatomy did not suffer more ischemia than patients who needed coronary artery bypass surgery but with other varieties of coronary anatomy. In patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy, the incidence of myocardial ischemia by primary anesthetic was 24.0% with enflurane, 34.4% with halothane, 32.1% with isoflurane, and 38.2% with sufentanil. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during anesthesia occurred in 416 (45.6%) patients and was twice as common during administration of volatile anesthetics than during that of sufentanil. Hypotension did not increase ischemia frequency in patients with steal-prone anatomy with use of any of the four primary anesthetics including isoflurane. Ischemia was temporally related to hypotension in only 9 patients (0.9%). In none of the 42 patients who had steal-prone anatomy and hypotension during isoflurane anesthesia was ischemia temporally related to hypotension. 
1	Ewing's sarcoma. Radiotherapy versus surgery for local control. Significant strides in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common bone tumor of childhood, have resulted in cure for approximately 50% of patients. Successful therapy requires systemic chemotherapy for the eradication of microscopic or overt metastatic disease and surgery or irradiation therapy for control of the primary lesion. The article debates the controversy over the extent to which surgical resection should play a role in the local management of this disease. 
3	Tethered cord syndrome from a choristoma of mullerian origin. Case report. The authors report a case of tethered cord syndrome due to a choristoma of mullerian origin located in the spinal cord at the lumbosacral junction. Two similar cases were found upon review of the literature. The embryology of this lesion is discussed. 
1	Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein in endometrial adenocarcinoma. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone. 
3	Acute phase reactants and risk of bacterial meningitis among febrile infants and children. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that quantitation of either C-reactive protein (CRP) or the total peripheral WBC count can improve clinical detection of underlying bacterial meningitis among young febrile children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of selected symptoms of central nervous system infection, signs of meningeal irritation and/or elevated intracranial pressure, levels of CRP in serum, and total peripheral WBC counts among unselected pediatric patients undergoing lumbar punctures for evaluation of acute febrile illnesses. SETTING: Emergency department and acute care "walk-in" clinic of an urban, university-affiliated general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 160 previously well, acutely febrile infants and children (median age, 6 months). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial meningitis was 6%. Sensitivity of symptoms was 1.00 and specificity was 0.17. Sensitivity of signs was 0.70 and specificity was 0.81. Of the acute phase reactants, sensitivity of a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL was 0.80, while that of a total peripheral WBC count of more than 15,000/mm3 was 0.40. The presence of signs and/or a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of signs and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 71 of 150 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.47). Of 125 children without meningeal signs, the combination of symptoms and a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all three children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of these symptoms and/or a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 80 of 122 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.66). CONCLUSION: Quantitation of CRP but not the total peripheral WBC count can increase the sensitivity of physical examination findings and the specificity of symptoms for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Measurement of CRP in serum is useful as an adjunct to history and physical examination for the detection of acute bacterial meningitis in the acutely febrile child. 
1	Follicular thyroid cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic, 1946 through 1970: initial manifestations, pathologic findings, therapy, and outcome We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the Mayo Clinic between 1946 and 1970. The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer. 
5	Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery. Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005). 
3	Mortality in acute stroke with atrial fibrillation. The Italian Acute Stroke Study Group. We compared 211 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic hemispheric stroke and atrial fibrillation with 837 consecutive patients who had stroke without atrial fibrillation. The atrial fibrillation group included a higher frequency of women, older subjects, and those with a severe neurologic deficit, abnormal computed tomogram, and elevated heart rate. The 1-month case-fatality rate in the atrial fibrillation group was 27% while that in the group without atrial fibrillation was 14%. The 6-month case-fatality rates in the two groups were 40% and 20%, respectively. The risk of death attributable to atrial fibrillation, adjusted for the effect of other prognostic factors, was significant at 1 month (relative risk = 1.55) and at 6 months (relative risk = 1.74). The causes of death were equally distributed in the two groups during both the acute and subacute phases. We conclude that atrial fibrillation is a negative prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for acute stroke. Nevertheless, cerebral embolism alone does not completely explain the increase in mortality for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Other associated pathogenetic mechanisms must also be taken into account. 
5	Renal replacement treatment for diabetic patients in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Northern region, 1964-88. OBJECTIVES--To review the experience of renal replacement treatment in diabetic patients treated in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Northern region from 1964 to 1988, and to compare the morbidity and mortality of diabetic patients treated with dialysis or transplantation with those of matched controls of non-diabetic patients. DESIGN--Retrospective study of clinical case notes. SETTING--Renal units of the Northern region, particularly that in Newcastle upon Tyne. PATIENTS--All 65 diabetic patients treated by renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne from 1964 to 1987; 42 diabetic patients were matched with 42 non-diabetic patients according to age, sex, year of starting treatment, and type of treatment (dialysis or transplantation). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Sex, age, renal biopsy findings, blood pressure, history of diabetic treatment, and plasma creatinine concentration at the start of renal replacement treatment. History of renal replacement treatments, suitability for transplantation, history of transplantation, cumulative survival, and cause of death during follow up. Survival of technique, cumulative survival of the first peritoneal catheter and history of peritonitis in patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; source of graft, histocompatibility antigens, duration of associated stay in hospital, and graft survival in patients receiving renal or pancreatic transplant. RESULTS--1259 Patients with chronic renal failure were accepted for renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne, of whom 65 (5%) had diabetes. The first was accepted in 1974, and between 1974 and 1980 another 15 were treated (mean age 42 years; 4% of new patients). From 1981 to 1987, 49 diabetic patients (mean age 44; 9% of new patients) were treated. Fifty patients (77%) had insulin dependent diabetes and the remaining 15 (23%) non-insulin dependent diabetes. On average, the patients were aged 25 (range 5-57) when diabetes was first diagnosed and 44 (range 24-70) at the start of renal replacement treatment. The mean age at the start of treatment was 40 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes and 58 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes. Transplantation was performed in 33 of the diabetic patients, whose mean age was lower than that of those who did not receive a transplant (41 v 48 respectively, p less than 0.05). Comparison between the 42 diabetic patients and matched controls showed that the overall survival at five years was 46% and 77% respectively. The three year survival of the diabetic patients who did not receive a transplant was poor (41% v 79% respectively). Of patients transplanted, survival at five years was 73% in the diabetic patients and 90% in the controls. However, there was no significant difference in the five year graft survival (64% v 46% respectively). CONCLUSIONS--Diabetes adversely affects morbidity and mortality in patients having renal replacement treatment, but renal transplantation seems to be the best option for treating diabetic patients with end stage renal failure. 
5	Acute urinary retention secondary to Herpes simplex meningitis. We report a case of acute urinary retention in a 24-year-old man with Herpes simplex meningitis without genital lesions. Since the differential diagnosis in young patients who present with acute urinary retention also includes multiple sclerosis, lumbosacral disk herniation, rheumatological disorders and drug intoxication, a thorough history and careful neurological examination are of paramount importance in distinguishing these syndromes. As part of a directed neurological evaluation prompt performance of lumbar puncture is indicated; a lymphocytic pleocytosis is suggestive of herpetic meningitis. Culture of Herpes simplex virus from the cerebrospinal fluid should be attempted. We recommend conservative management only, typically with intermittent catheterization, since bladder function usually normalizes within 10 to 14 days. 
5	Indications for computed tomography in children with blunt abdominal trauma. This investigation was undertaken to identify clinical variables, alone or in combination, that could be used to assign children to high- and low-risk categories for intra-abdominal injury following blunt trauma. Six hundred consecutive children who were examined with computed tomography (CT) following blunt trauma were enrolled. Complete data sets were available on 375 children. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictor variables for the presence of abdominal injury. There were 174 children with abdominal injury detected by CT. Of these, 95 were classified as having significant injury. Indicators associated with significantly higher risk of abdominal injury included the following: more than three clinical indications given (odds likelihood ratio [OLR] = 4.60, 95% confidence interval [95% Cl] = 2.29, 9.21, p less than 0.001); gross hematuria (OLR = 5.80, 95% Cl = 2.51, 13.4, p less than 0.001); lap belt injury (OLR = 12.2, 95% Cl = 2.22, 66.8, p less than 0.01); assault or abuse as the mechanism of injury (OLR = 5.08, 95% Cl = 1.07, 24.2, p less than 0.05); abdominal tenderness (OLR = 2.73, 95% Cl = 1.296, 5.82, p less than 0.01); and Trauma Score less than or equal to 12 (OLR = 2.27, 95% Cl = 1.006, 5.13, p less than 0.01). No child with asymptomatic hematuria (n = 56), regardless of grade or neurologic impairment in the absence of abdominal findings (n = 15), had an abnormal CT examination. These data are useful as an adjunct to clinical judgment in triage when the availability of CT equipment is limited or there are competing extra-abdominal injuries. 
3	Lexical organization of nouns and verbs in the brain. The analysis of neuropsychological disorders of lexical processing has provided important clues about the general organization of the lexical system and the internal structure of the processing components. Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories. There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words. But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system. Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively. The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components. 
5	Vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome--a review [published erratum appears in Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1991 Mar;98(3):329-30] A search of the literature yielded 12 controlled trials on vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome. These are discussed with emphasis on methodological aspects. A major drawback of the trials is the limited number of patients included. The existing evidence of positive effects of vitamin B6 is weak, and some well-designed trials with positive results would be needed to change this view. 
3	Ratio of immunochemically determined amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase to butyrylcholinesterase in the differential diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. A total of 111 amniotic fluid samples, clear or blood stained, with elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase was analysed by immunoassays specific for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase and the acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase-ratios determined. Samples from 40 pregnancies associated with anencephaly, 47 pregnancies associated with open spina bifida or encephalocele and six pregnancies with fetal intrauterine death or miscarriage all had ratios of greater than 0.14. All 11 pregnancies with fetal ventral wall defects had ratios less than 0.14 as had four pregnancies with normal outcome and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. Three fetuses with both open spina bifida and ventral wall defects were associated with ratios above 0.14. These results suggest that immunochemical determination of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase can be used to distinguish pregnancies complicated by anencephaly, open spina bifida, encephalocele and miscarriage from those with ventral wall defects and samples with false positive elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. The procedure is accurate and simple to carry out and well suited to routine use in a clinical chemistry laboratory. 
5	Colonic motor activity in acute colitis in conscious dogs. The changes in motor activity of the colon during acute colitis were investigated in six conscious dogs. The motor activity was recorded with seven strain-gauge transducers. Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon. 
1	Ki67 index and S-phase fraction in human breast carcinomas. Comparison and correlations with prognostic factors. In a prospective study of 148 consecutive breast adenocarcinomas, proliferative indices of the same surgical tumor sample were performed by immunohistologic staining (Ki67 index) with the use of the Ki67 monoclonal antibody, which binds to a nuclear antigen only expressed in cycling cells, and by flow cytometry-derived S-phase fraction (SPF). Measurable Ki67 and SPF indices were obtained in 142 cases and 99 cases, respectively, and in 96 cases by both methods. In aneuploid tumors, a significant but low (P less than 0.05, r = 0.3) relationship was observed between Ki67 index and SPF. When compared with clinical, pathologic, and biochemical parameters these two proliferative indices were shown to be associated with nuclear grading and mitotic index. Additionally, correlations were observed between Ki67 index and node involvement (P less than 0.02) and between SPF and estrogen receptors (P = 0.002). These results show that (1) proliferative indices are obtained in 96% of surgical samples with Ki67 versus 67% with SPF and that (2) Ki67 index and SPF may provide complementary data with respect to prognosis. 
5	Effects of menstrual phase and amenorrhea on exercise performance in runners. There are few well controlled studies in terms of subject selection, menstrual classification, and exercise protocol that have examined both maximal and submaximal exercise responses during different phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic runners and compared these runners to amenorrheic runners. Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure selected physiological and metabolic responses to maximal and submaximal exercise during two phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic runners and amenorrheic runners. Eight eumenorrheic runners (29.0 +/- 4.2 yr) and eight amenorrheic runners (24.5 +/- 5.7 yr) matched for physical, gynecological, and training characteristics were studied. The eumenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run during both the early follicular (days 2-4) and midluteal (6-8 d from LH surge) phases. The amenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run. Cycle phases were documented by urinary luteinizing hormone and progesterone assays and by plasma estradiol and progesterone assays. No differences were observed in oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, rating of perceived exertion, time to fatigue (maximal), and plasma lactate (following the maximal and submaximal exercise tests) between the follicular and luteal phases in the eumenorrheic runners and the amenorrheic runners. We conclude that neither menstrual phase (follicular vs luteal) nor menstrual status (eumenorrheic vs amenorrheic) alters or limits exercise performance in female athletes. 
4	Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the lung. Congenital nonvascular anomalies of the lung can be subdivided into those affecting the bronchial tree and those affecting parenchymal abnormalities. Embryologic development of the lung is briefly reviewed to facilitate an understanding of developmental pulmonary anomalies. Clinical, radiographic, and therapeutic aspects of these anomalies are discussed. 
3	Clarifying confusion: the confusion assessment method. A new method for detection of delirium OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a new standardized confusion assessment method (CAM) that enables nonpsychiatric clinicians to detect delirium quickly in high-risk settings. DESIGN: Prospective validation study. SETTING: Conducted in general medicine wards and in an outpatient geriatric assessment center at Yale University (site 1) and in general medicine wards at the University of Chicago (site 2). PATIENTS: The study included 56 subjects, ranging in age from 65 to 98 years. At site 1, 10 patients with and 20 without delirium participated; at site 2, 16 patients with and 10 without delirium participated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel developed the CAM through a consensus building process. The CAM instrument, which can be completed in less than 5 minutes, consists of nine operationalized criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R). An a priori hypothesis was established for the diagnostic value of four criteria: acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. The CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium required the presence of both the first and the second criteria and of either the third or the fourth criterion. At both sites, the diagnoses made by the CAM were concurrently validated against the diagnoses made by psychiatrists. At sites 1 and 2 values for sensitivity were 100% and 94%, respectively; values for specificity were 95% and 90%; values for positive predictive accuracy were 91% and 94%; and values for negative predictive accuracy were 100% and 90%. The CAM algorithm had the highest predictive accuracy for all possible combinations of the nine features of delirium. The CAM was shown to have convergent agreement with four other mental status tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination. The interobserver reliability of the CAM was high (kappa = 0.81 - 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The CAM is sensitive, specific, reliable, and easy to use for identification of delirium. 
1	The mutation for medullary thyroid carcinoma with parathyroid tumors (MTC with PTs) is closely linked to the centromeric region of chromosome 10. Two new morphs (F and G) detected by the centromeric alpha satellite probe p alpha 10RP8 and D10Z1 in HinfI digests are linked to the PstI polymorphisms of D10Z1, confirming their chromosome 10 location. The F and G morphs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other but were in weak linkage disequilibrium with the A and B morphs defined in PstI digests. Data for haplotypes formed by using the A and F morphs improved the lod score for linkage between the disease locus for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and D10Z1 (Z = 14.06 at theta = 0) in the six large families studied by Wu et al. Furthermore, the locus that codes for a distinct phenotype, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with parathyroid tumors (PTs) and no pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) (referred to as MTC with PTs), in one of the families was closely linked to two markers, D10Z1 and RBP3, with lodscores of 2.86 and 3.54, respectively, at theta = 0. A possible allelic association was noted between disease phenotypes and centromeric haplotypes. The phenotype MTC and PHEOs with and without PTs was associated with the same relatively common centromeric haplotype (A + B-F-G-) in the four families in which all four morphs could be determined, while the phenotype MTC with PTs was associated with the rare centromeric haplotype (A-B-F-G+) in one family. 
4	The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry: overview of acute hemodynamic results and procedural complications. Between December 1, 1986 and October 30, 1987, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 492 patients with aortic stenosis (mean age 79 +/- 8.4 years) enrolled in the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry. All procedures were performed from a femoral approach (92%), brachial approach (6%) or transseptal approach (2%) and utilized either a single balloon technique (72%) or a double balloon technique (28%). Valvuloplasty resulted in a significant improvement in aortic valve area (0.50 +/- 0.18 cm2 to 0.82 +/- 0.30 cm2), mean aortic valve gradient (60 +/- 23 mm Hg to 30 +/- 13 mm Hg) and cardiac output (3.86 +/- 1.26 to 4.05 +/- 1.31 liters/min). Serial aortography demonstrated a moderate or severe increase in aortic insufficiency in only 2.1% of patients. Statistical analysis of the procedural factors affecting acute valvuloplasty results demonstrated significant correlations of single versus double balloon technique, total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with respect to the absolute change in mean aortic valve gradient occurring during the valvuloplasty procedure. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the maximal time of valvuloplasty balloon inflation with aortic valve area measured after valvuloplasty, and there were significant correlations of the total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with the aortic valve mean gradient measured after valvuloplasty. The overall complication rate for the procedure was 20.5%, including vascular injury in 11%, embolic phenomenon in 2.2%, ventricular perforation resulting in tamponade in 1.8%, massive aortic insufficiency in 1%, nonfatal arrhythmia in 0.8% and myocardial infarction in 0.2%. 
3	Meralgia paresthetica after coronary bypass surgery. Meralgia paresthetica is a neurologic disorder characterized by localized paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. It involves no motor deficits. Meralgia paresthetica, which may result from a variety of causes, has been observed as a rare complication in heart operations. Its cause when associated with such operations is uncertain but may be prolonged relaxed positioning on the operating table and recovery room stretcher. Another possible cause of meralgia paresthetica after heart operations is the "frog-leg" position of the legs during vein harvesting. Patients with this condition should be advised of its untreatable, but benign and self-limiting, nature. 
1	Modified anterior compartment resection. In the majority of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the anterior compartment of the thigh, it is possible to preserve a small portion of the quadriceps with intact nerve supply without compromising on the radicality of the procedure or the local control rate. The distal one-third of the vastus medialis can usually be spared with a long, slender branch providing its innervation. Dissection of the femoral nerve below the inguinal ligament and its branch(es) to an uninvolved area of the quadricepts the farthest from the location of the tumor is essential. This modified anterior compartment resection improves dramatically the function of the extremity. 
1	Pheochromocytoma in the pediatric age group: the prostate--an unusual location. Pheochromocytomas of the prostate are rare, with only 3 cases in adults reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a pheochromocytoma of the prostate and a second tumor in the region of the left internal iliac artery. 
1	Recombinative events of the T cell antigen receptor delta gene in peripheral T cell lymphomas. Recombinative events of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) delta-chain gene were studied in 37 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and related to their clinical presentation and the expression of the alpha beta or gamma delta heterodimers as determined by immunostaining of frozen tissue samples. There were 22 cases of alpha beta, 5 cases of gamma delta, and 10 cases of silent TCR expressing neither the alpha beta nor gamma delta TCR. 5 different probes were used to examine the delta locus. The 22 cases of alpha beta PTCL displayed biallelic and monoallelic deletions; a monoallelic V delta 1 J delta 1 rearrangement was observed in 1 case and a monoallelic germ line configuration in 7 cases. The 5 cases of gamma delta PTCL displayed biallelic rearrangements: the productive rearrangements could be ascribed to V delta 1J delta 1 joining in 3 cases and VJ delta 1 joining in 2 cases according to the combined pattern of DNA hybridization with the appropriate probes and of cell reactivity with the TCR delta-1, delta TCS-1, and anti-V delta 2 monoclonal antibodies. In the VJ delta 1 joining, the rearranged V segments were located between V delta 1 and V delta 2. Interestingly, in the third group of 10 cases of silent PTCL, 5 cases were found to have a TCR gene configuration identical to that in the TCR alpha beta PTCL, as demonstrated by biallelic delta gene deletion. These 5 cases were CD3 positive. The 5 remaining cases showed a monoallelic delta gene rearrangement with a monoallelic germ line configuration in 4 and a monoallelic deletion in 1. Four of these cases were CD3 negative, which was consistent with an immature genotype the TCR commitent of which could not be ascertained. Finally, TCR gamma delta PTCL consisted of a distinct clinical morphological and molecular entity whereas TCR alpha beta and silent PTCL had a similar presentation. 
5	Neonatal repair of tetralogy of Fallot with and without pulmonary atresia. Our experience with the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries has confirmed the attainability of excellent results with elective neonatal surgery. Up to this time, we have repaired tetralogy of Fallot during the neonatal period only when symptoms, either severe persistent cyanosis or cyanotic spells, have been present. This review assesses the results of such nonelective neonatal correction of tetralogy between 1973 and 1988. Twenty-seven neonates with either symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot or symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot with valvar pulmonary atresia underwent repair. Mean age at repair was 8 +/- 8.4 days and mean weight was 3.0 +/- 0.7 kg. Unsatisfactory palliative shunts had previously been placed elsewhere in four patients. Twenty-five transannular patches and two conduits were used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. There were five deaths in the hospital, three of which were due to avoidable technical problems. All deaths occurred in patients with pulmonary artery (Nakata) index less than 150 mm2/m2. One premature child weighing 2.3 kg displayed an absent pulmonary valve-like syndrome after repair and died late of respiratory complications caused by aneurysmal branch pulmonary arteries. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 74%. There was a single rapidly declining hazard phase for death, with the hazard approaching zero at 1 1/2 years after repair. Actuarial freedom from need for reoperation was 76% at 5 years. Postoperative catheterization of 15 long-term survivors showed right ventricular pressure less than 70% systemic in 13 cases. All patients are symptomatically well and functioning in sinus rhythm 1 to 15 years after repair (mean, 5 +/- 4 years). This experience with neonates with symptoms suggests that, if mortality is lower in the absence of symptoms, elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot could be reasonably undertaken during the first months of life. 
4	Cardiac rhythm disturbances early after orthotopic heart transplantation: prevalence and clinical importance of the observed abnormalities. To precisely define the incidence, type and consequences of cardiac arrhythmias early after heart transplantation, 25 cardiac transplant recipients were monitored continuously for 728 days from the day of surgery to discharge or death. A subset of 15 patients had sinus node function studies with overdrive suppression performed weekly at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. Results revealed sinus bradycardia in 10 patients (40%) and junctional bradycardia in 6 (24%). Supraventricular tachycardia in the form of atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 11 patients (44%). Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 15 patients (60%) and was nonsustained in all. Cardiac pacing for 1,403 h was used in nine patients with a pulse rate less than 50 beats/min; seven recovered and permanent pacing was instituted in two. In the subgroup that had sinus node function studies, seven patients were identified with clinical bradyarrhythmia; each had abnormal sinus node recovery time (greater than 1,400 ms) and abnormal corrected sinus node recovery time (greater than 525 ms) in at least one study. These seven patients also had a significantly prolonged ischemic time (236 +/- 26 versus 159 +/- 68 min, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and bradyarrhythmia, occur more commonly early after orthotopic heart transplantation than has previously been reported. Sinus node dysfunction due to prolonged organ ischemic time, antiarrhythmic drug use or surgical trauma, alone or in combination, may contribute to these arrhythmias. 
2	Quantitation of intrinsic drug-metabolizing capacity in human liver biopsy specimens: support for the intact-hepatocyte theory. Hepatic drug metabolism is decreased in patients with severe liver disease, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to altered hepatic blood flow or reduced intrinsic metabolic capacity. In this study we quantitated in needle-biopsy specimens the intrinsic capacity of liver tissue from 67 patients with mild liver disease (n = 36), chronic active hepatitis (n = 16) and cirrhosis (n = 15) to metabolize two model compounds in vitro. Hydroxylation of the low-extraction drug bufuralol resulted in the formation of 251 +/- 25 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/gm wet wt/hr in mildly diseased liver tissue and was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in liver tissue exhibiting chronic active hepatitis (166 +/- 23 nmol/gm wet wt/hr) and cirrhosis (124 +/- 21 nmol/gm wet wt/hr). The formation rates of monoethylglycinexylidide, the main metabolite of the high-extraction drug lidocaine, varied widely and were not significantly different among the three groups. To relate the drug-metabolizing capacity to the hepatocyte content of liver tissue, morphometrical study was performed in the biopsy pieces originally submitted. The metabolic activity of each biopsy piece was then related to the fractional volume of hepatocytes it was calculated to contain. In mildly diseased liver tissue 355 +/- 35 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 12.4 +/- 1.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr- and in cirrhotic liver tissue 306 +/- 49 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 15.3 +/- 3.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr--were formed, respectively, and these differences were not significant. 
5	Carotid artery resection and replacement in patients with head and neck malignant tumors. Tumor involvement of the carotid artery with head and neck cancers may be present either simultaneously with the primary lesion or more often appears at a later date following resection of the primary tumor. Management of the secondary tumor consists of its resection together with the involved carotid artery with or without carotid artery reconstruction. The Authors are convinced that the best chance for cure of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers involving the carotid artery is radical extirpation with ablative surgery in the form of en block resection of the primary lesion, the secondary tumor, and the involved carotid artery followed by immediate revascularization. This bold approach was carried out in two male patients, 48 and 61 years of age, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in one and radiation therapy alone in the other, with excellent results. Dermal grafts were placed over the entire length of the arterialized veins to protect them from radiation injury. Based on this limited experience and excellent results, we recommend this one-stage surgical ablative procedure in well selected patients. However, cooperation between the ENT and vascular surgeons, strict adherence to the principles and techniques of vascular surgery, and coverage of the arterialized vein with a dermal graft is absolutely essential. 
5	The treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis with cartilage removal alone. Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears (16 women and eight men) and the helix in 40 ears (six women and 34 men) were studied. Twelve ears responded to intralesional steroid therapy. Under local anesthetic, 46 operations were performed to remove cartilage without skin excision. On the helix, a longitudinal incision was made; on the antihelix, a flap was raised and the underlying cartilage was excised, taking care to leave no rough cartilage edges. Follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 4.5 to 34 months) showed that 10 of 17 antihelix lesions and 24 of 29 helix lesions healed completely with excellent cosmetic results. Recurrences, requiring further treatment, occurred at cartilage-excision margins in seven ears, and further cartilage excision alone was successful in four ears. This study demonstrates that only cartilage needs to be removed in the surgical treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis. 
3	The influence of the calcium antagonist nimodipine and induced hypertension on the behavior of the cerebral pial arteries, the blood-brain barrier, cerebral edema, and cerebral infarction in cats with one-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Thirty anesthetized cats were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10 cats each: nimodipine treatment, nimodipine treatment combined with induced hypertension, or a control group. The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window. The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach. Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed. Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment. Induced hypertension was produced by administration of dopamine during the occlusion. Damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was judged by extravasation of Evans blue dye. Cerebral edema and infarction were evaluated from histological findings. They were most prominent in the control group: the extent of hemisphere affected was as follows (mean +/- standard error): extravasation, 40.5 +/- 8.8%; edema, 43.2 +/- 5.7%; infarction, 35.5 +/- 9.6%. On the other hand, the extravasation of Evans blue dye and cerebral edema were significantly more extensive in the group treated with nimodipine and induced hypertension (extravasation, 28.2 +/- 9.6% of the hemisphere; edema, 30.3 +/- 7.1%) than in the group treated with nimodipine alone (extravasation, 18.5 +/- 8.7% of the hemisphere; edema, 19.4 +/- 6.3%), but the infarction size was similar in both groups (16.6 +/- 4.9% of the hemisphere in the former; 17.0 +/- 6.2 in the latter). 
1	Heffalumps, jagulars, and cheshire cats. A commentary on cytokeratins and soft tissue sarcomas. Historically, antibodies to cytokeratin intermediate filaments have been models of target specificity. In most diagnostic settings, the utility of these antibodies was unquestioned; reactivity for cytokeratin was dogmatically equated with epithelial differentiation. Recently, however, the diagnostic importance of these antibodies has been challenged, prompted by the demonstration of cytokeratin reactivity in a variety of "nonepithelial" neoplasms. In this review, the evolving literature on this topic is explored, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed. 
3	The distribution of muscle weakness in upper motoneuron lesions affecting the lower limb. To determine the distribution of weakness in the lower limb after upper motoneuron lesions the strength of 8 muscle groups was measured. Four groups of patients were studied: 22 control subjects, 16 patients with unilateral leg paresis, 4 patients with severe unilateral paralysis and 5 patients with paraparesis. In the testing posture (seated), patients with cerebral upper motoneuron lesions showed no selective loss of power in flexors or extensors on the contralateral side. Gravitational torques were included in the measurements. However, proximal muscles (acting at hip and knee) were significantly less severely affected than more distal muscles (acting at ankle and hallux). At any particular joint, physiological flexors and extensors were affected equally in both the hemiparetic and paraparetic subjects. As in the upper limb (Colebatch and Gandevia, 1989), the strength of muscles on the clinically unaffected side was reduced compared with control subjects, although no muscle groups were especially affected. 
1	Role of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy in suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (PFNA) biopsy is an accepted technique for the diagnosis of suspected intrathoracic malignancy, but the appropriate indications for its use have not been clearly defined. To help establish guidelines, we performed a retrospective analysis of 188 patients who underwent PFNA biopsy for suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Biopsy led to a diagnosis in 72% (135/188) of the patients, but in 27% (50/188) samples were inadequate for cytological diagnosis, and in 2% (3/188) samples were adequate but failed to yield a diagnosis. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical intervention, thus allowing histological confirmation of the cytological diagnosis. In patients with a diagnosis from PFNA biopsy, operation confirmed malignancy in 97% (37/38) and a specific cell type in 79% (30/38). In patients without a diagnosis after biopsy, a malignancy was found in 73% (11/15) at the time of operation. This suggests a high rate of accuracy when PFNA biopsy provides a diagnosis. However, it also illustrates that a substantial percentage of PFNA biopsy attempts fail to yield a diagnosis in patients ultimately found to have malignancies. This implies that PFNA biopsy might best be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates. 
5	Delayed brachial artery occlusion owing to a dog bite of the upper extremity. We report a case of delayed presentation of vascular injury from a superficial dog bite of the upper extremity in a five-year-old male. This example of a significant arterial injury, in the setting of seemingly minor trauma, is the first known report of blunt arterial trauma owing to a dog bite in any age group. Blunt arterial trauma in children is rare unless associated with fractures, dislocations, or massive crush injuries. Additionally, persistent pulses following arterial occlusion are rare and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis of a serious arterial injury. A brief review of pediatric blunt vascular injuries is presented with implications for diagnosis and management of such cases. 
5	Effect of amiodarone on erythrocyte shape and membrane properties. 1. Amiodarone is a potent anti-arrhythmic drug with lipophilic properties. The intercalation of such a drug into the membrane of erythrocytes may alter their shape and have an impact on the flow properties of blood. We therefore studied the influence of amiodarone on erythrocyte shape and deformability in vitro and in vivo. 2. Incubation in vitro with increasing amiodarone concentrations led to a progressive stomatocytic shape transformation and a decreased deformability of the erythrocytes. 3. Amiodarone treatment in eight patients did not affect erythrocyte morphology and deformability. However, an increase in the membrane cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was found. 4. The stomatocytic shape transformation of erythrocytes in vitro indicates that amiodarone intercalates in the inner hemileaflet of the lipid bilayer leading to membrane internalization. These results shed light on the interaction of amiodarone with biomembranes. 
5	Comparison of frequency of late potentials in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with advanced congestive heart failure and their usefulness in predicting sudden death. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were obtained in 62 consecutive patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing evaluation for possible heart transplantation to determine if late potentials: (1) provide unique information compared to assessment of ventricular ectopic activity on ambulatory electrocardiogram, and (2) identify a subgroup of CHF patients with higher sudden death risk. Patients with a history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia were excluded. CHF was due to old myocardial infarction in 40 patients and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 22 patients. Late potentials were present in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with old infarction but in only 3 of 22 (14%) patients with nonischemic CHF (p = 0.03). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained in 34 patients (55%). Total ventricular ectopic activity and repetitive forms of ectopy were similar in patients with and without late potentials. Nine patients died suddenly, 9 had nonsudden death, 15 underwent heart transplantation and 29 were alive and well after a mean follow-up of 218 +/- 154 days. At 1 year, the actuarial risk of death was 37% and of sudden death was 20%. Sudden death risk was 12% in patients with late potentials versus 21% in those without (p = 0.73). Thus, the incidence of the arrhythmia substrate producing late potentials depends on the CHF etiology. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiogram provide independent information for possible risk assessment in CHF. However, late potentials are poor predictors of sudden death risk when CHF is advanced, possibly due to the heterogeneity of causes of sudden death--ventricular tachycardia being only 1 of many possible mechanisms. 
5	Premature menopause because of an inherited deletion in the long arm of the X-chromosome. A family is described in which both a mother and an infertile daughter had premature menopause at the ages of 31 and 28 years, respectively. Initially, an extensive investigation revealed no apparent cause for their conditions. However, when cytogenetic analysis in the daughter was performed, a terminal deletion in the long arm of one of the X-chromosomes was found. The karyotype was: 46,Xdel(X),(q25-qter). Chromosomal investigation in the mother showed an identical deletion. The karyotype of the patient's 35-year-old sister is normal. She has a normal menstrual cycle and two normal children. The presence of such familial cases suggests that chromosomal investigation should be considered in young women with oligomenorrhea, especially those whose mothers have experienced a premature menopause. 
3	Shunt surgery for hydrocephalus in tuberculous meningitis: a long-term follow-up study. Hydrocephalus is a common complication of tuberculous meningitis. Case studies of 114 patients with tuberculous meningitis and hydrocephalus, who underwent shunt surgery between July, 1975, and June, 1986, were reviewed to evaluate the long-term outcome and to outline a management protocol for these patients based on the results. Seven factors were studied in each case: 1) age at admission; 2) grade on admission (I to IV, classified by the authors; Grade I being the best and Grade IV being the worst); 3) duration of alteration of sensorium; 4) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell content at initial examination; 5) CSF protein levels at initial examination; 6) number of shunt revisions required; and 7) the necessity for bilateral shunts. During a long-term follow-up period ranging from 6 months to 13 years (mean 45.6 months), the mortality rate was 20% for patients in Grade I; 34.7% for patients in Grade II; 51.9% for patients in Grade III; and 100% for patients in Grade IV. Only the grade at the time of admission was found to be statistically significant in determining final outcome (p less than 0.001). Based on these results, the authors advocate early shunt surgery for Grade I and II patients. For patients in Grade III, surgery may be performed either if external ventricular drainage causes an improvement in sensorium or without selection. All patients in Grade IV should undergo external ventricular drainage and only those who show a significant change in their neurological status within 24 to 48 hours of drainage, should have shunt surgery. 
5	Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management. 
4	Underestimation of treatment effect in crossover trials. In crossover trials each subject serves as his own control. For the study of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina pectoria, properly designed crossover studies are preferred to parallel studies. There is a considerable between-subject variability of symptoms in some of these conditions. Bias due to this is eliminated by the use of a crossover design. However, a problem is the so-called treatment-by-period interaction. The present study analyzes the potential influences of this on the outcome of the trial. Physical carryover effect, defined as a physical effect of the first treatment period carrying on into the second, tends to minimize differences between two consecutive treatment periods. So does the frustrating experience of an inactive agent in the first treatment period. Outside influences such as the change of the seasons may affect lengthy crossover trials in a similar way. The author concludes that the treatment effect in a crossover trial tends to be underestimated. The current concept that reports of clinical trials are generally biased toward an exaggeration of treatment effects does not seem to apply to crossover trials. 
3	AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented. The electrodiagnostic approach to patients with this neuropathy is reviewed emphasizing new developments. The interpretation of the findings in this patient centers around issues of pathophysiology and methodology. 
1	Intracranial tumor in infants: characteristics, management, and outcome of a contemporary series. Since 1980, 22 patients less than 2 years of age have been treated for intracranial tumors at our institution. The most common presentation was elevated intracranial pressure associated with ventriculomegaly (73%). The diagnosis was made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed surgically in every case. In 68% of cases, the tumor involved midline structures in the central nervous system. Tumors were infratentorial in 29% of patients less than 1 year of age and in 60% of those more than 1 year of age. Most tumors were either primitive neuroectodermal tumors (41%, 7 of 9 located in midline posterior fossa structures) or astrocytomas (27%, 5 of 6 located in the hypothalamus, chiasm, or optic nerve). Twenty patients had gross or subtotal tumor resection. Surgical mortality and neurological morbidity were 10% and 5%, respectively. Of 5 patients who underwent a second operation for tumor recurrence, 3 demonstrated a change in the pathological features of the tumor from those of the original diagnosis. Of 10 surgical survivors with malignant tumors, 8 received chemotherapy and 5 radiation therapy. Radiation was not administered before 1 year of age. The overall 1-year survival was 70%, and 2-year survival was 58%. Two-year survival for benign and malignant tumors was not significantly different. We think that the interdisciplinary efforts directed toward the treatment of these tumors has improved survival and that all children should be offered entry to a research protocol and aggressive treatment. 
3	Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients. Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated. Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia. However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both. The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs). 
3	Prognostic factors in the treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with alopecia areata were treated with diphenylcyclopropenone. Before treatment, 85 patients had subtotal or total hair loss (greater than 90% bald area) and in the remaining patients scalp involvement was between 40% and 90%. The following three factors were found to be of prognostic significance: type of alopecia areata as documented before treatment, duration of the disease before therapy, and presence of nail changes. Other factors such as age at onset, sex, presence of atopic features, the extent of variation in the range of diphenylcyclopropenone concentrations during treatment, and sleep disturbances caused by pruritus did not influence the prognosis significantly. 
5	Characterization of a large deletion associated with a polymorphic block of repeated dinucleotides in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by extreme fragility of skin, blood vessels, intestine, gravid uterus, and lungs. The phenotype is accounted for by mutations affecting the integrity and/or synthesis of the precursor procollagen molecules of type III collagen. In this article, we report the elucidation of the molecular defect in an EDS IV patient whose type III collagen was previously found to be structurally abnormal. We utilized PCR in a two-step process involving first the localization of the mutation in the mRNA and then the characterization of the defect in the gene. The results established the patient's heterozygosity for a genomic deletion of about 7.5 kb which eliminates 1,026 nucleotides of coding sequences in the message. The mutation arose as a result of an exon-to-intron recombination. The deleted segment extends from the 13th nucleotide of exon 9 to within a DNA sequence of intron 24, which is composed of a series of dinucleotide repeats. Using PCR, we tested the polymorphic nature of this DNA element on several unrelated individuals. Analysis of amplified genomic products of 45 chromosomes recognized at least four distinct allelic forms that display frequencies ranging from 5% to 61%. Mendelian segregation of three of the four alleles was established by the same method in a 3-generation family. 
5	Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature. Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported. The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults. Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen. The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented. One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process. One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions. Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described. 
3	Stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using a multimodal image analysis system. Technical note. A methodology has been developed for stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using an image-analysis system that simultaneously displays different structural and functional images of the brain. The validity and accuracy of this system were established with phantom studies. Surgical planning and electrode implantation are guided by stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and position emission tomography. This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy. 
5	Does indomethacin alter the hemodynamic response to magnesium sulfate infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes? The purpose of this study was to determine whether indomethacin alters the maternal and fetal hemodynamic response to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes. We studied seven chronically instrumented animals between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. The experimental sequence included: 1) at time 0, indomethacin, 2 mg/kg, or vehicle only intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes; 2) at 60 minutes, MgSO4 4 g IV over 5 minutes; 3) at 65 minutes, MgSO4 infusion at 4 g/hour; 4) at 150 minutes, maternal hemorrhage, 20 mL/kg, over 60 minutes; and 5) at 215 minutes, reinfusion of maternal blood over 60 minutes. Each animal was studied with and without indomethacin. Indomethacin, but not vehicle only, transiently increased maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure (MAP), decreased maternal and fetal heart rate, and decreased maternal cardiac output. Magnesium sulfate significantly decreased uterine vascular resistance and increased uterine blood flow both with and without indomethacin. Hemorrhage significantly decreased maternal MAP, heart rate, cardiac output, and uterine blood flow in both groups. The magnitude of each change was similar between the groups. For example, at the end of hemorrhage, maternal MAP was 36 +/- 7% below baseline (P = .0001) with indomethacin and 41 +/- 2% below baseline (P = .0001) in the vehicle-only group (P = not significant between groups). Hemorrhage significantly decreased fetal heart rate, pH, and PO2, and increased fetal MAP and PCO2 in both groups. We conclude that indomethacin did not alter the maternal or fetal hemodynamic response to MgSO4 infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes. 
1	Intracerebral solitary plasmacytoma. We report a rare occurrence of intraparenchymal plasmacytoma and review the literature. The clonal nature of the neoplasm is demonstrated by immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. The importance of the latter techniques in ruling out other pathological entities is stressed. 
3	Excitatory amino acids in the developing brain: ontogeny, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. Besides their role as neurotransmitters, excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the developing brain are crucially involved in plasticity and excitotoxicity which are modified by their distinct ontogeny. Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. 
4	Alarm reaction and serum K+ in hypertensive patients. The effect of serum K+ of the alarm reaction induced by the participation to an experimental noninvasive study was evaluated in 35 subjects with borderline hypertension and in 18 essential hypertensives. A group of 44 inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling served as a control. Serum K+, blood pressure and heart rate were measured before (casual) and after (baseline) 20 min of rest in the recumbent position. Baseline serum K+ values were significantly higher than casual values in patients participating to the experimental protocol while no change was observed in inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling. The increase in serum K+ induced by relaxation was significantly related to heart rate decrease (r = 0.73). After relaxation 75% of patients had an increase in serum K+ with a change greater than 10% in about 35% of patients. In a subgroup of patients who repeated the same test three times, the alarm reaction was still evident and not reproducible within each patient. These data suggest that when potassium levels are measured in outpatients undergoing diagnostic or experimental procedures falsely reduced levels can be found in a large proportion of subjects. 
5	Acute myocardial infarction and chest pain syndromes after cocaine use. Seventy patients hospitalized with chest pain after cocaine use were retrospectively evaluated to define the risk and clinical course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI developed in 22 patients (31%) and transient myocardial ischemia was seen in an additional 9 patients (13%). Coronary risk factors did not distinguish those who developed AMI from those who did not. The presenting electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 of 22 patients who evolved AMI and in 19 of 48 of those who did not. Creatine kinase levels were elevated in 75% of the patients, including 65% of those who did not develop AMI, but creatine kinase-MB elevations were only observed in the AMI group. The route of cocaine administration did not predict AMI and there was no predilection for a particular coronary vascular bed. The length of time between drug use and onset of AMI pain was often quite prolonged (median interval, 18 vs 1 hour in the non-AMI group). Eight of the patients with AMI underwent cardiac catheterization and 4 had significant coronary narrowing. 
4	A rheolytic system for percutaneous coronary and peripheral plaque removal. A method for plaque dissolution has been identified that percutaneously delivers a pulsatile high-velocity stream of saline to the site of an atheromatous lesion within a coronary or peripheral artery. In vitro evaluation and in vivo canine and porcine testing were performed using this 'rheolytic' system to determine its feasibility in ablating calcified plaque and soft thrombotic tissue. A prototype rheolytic guidewire capable of providing 30,000 psi of internal pressure was designed to fit within the guidewire lumen of a standard percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter. An additional over-the-wire rheolytic catheter was fabricated to follow a standard .014-inch guidewire. The rheolytic devices were tested in vitro with simulated atheromatous and thrombotic lesions to evaluate the size and quantity of the particulate effluent. The particulate was then sterilized, mixed with saline, and introduced percutaneously into the animal kidney and heart for evaluation. The in vitro studies demonstrated that the rheolytic catheter and guidewire were able to follow both a coronary and femoral arterial model and successfully ablate the simulated lesions. The particle size for osseous, muscular, and cartilagenous tissue ranged from 2 to 6 micrometers; for fresh human plaque the particles ranged from 2 to 15 micrometers. Injection of cartilagenous and plaque particles into the animal model caused very slight regions of necrosis but no clinical sequelae. Applications of the rheolytic devices to the animal femoral artery demonstrated that both devices could ablate and cross calified or soft thrombosed lesions without damage to the vessel wall; the rheolytic catheter provided a debulking of the plaque. 
4	Epidemiology of heart failure. Analysis of 34 years of follow-up of Framingham Study data provides clinically relevant insights into the prevalence, incidence, secular trends, prognosis, and modifiable risk factors for the occurrence of heart failure in a general population sample. Heart failure was found to be highly prevalent, affecting about 1% of persons in their 50s and rising progressively with age to afflict 10% of persons in their 80s. The annual incidence also increased with age, from about 0.2% in persons 45 to 54 years, to 4.0% in men 85 to 94 years, with the incidence approximately doubling with each decade of age. Women lagged slightly behind men in incidence at all ages. Male predominance was because of a higher rate of coronary heart disease, which confers a fourfold increased risk of heart failure. Heart failure, once manifest, was highly lethal, with 37% of men and 33% of women dying within 2 years of diagnosis. The 6-year mortality rate was 82% for men and 67% for women, which corresponded to a death rate fourfold to eightfold greater than that of the general population of the same age. Sudden death was a common mode of exitus and accounted for 28% of the cardiovascular deaths in men and 14% in women with heart failure. Hypertension and coronary disease were the predominant causes for heart failure and accounted for more than 80% of all clinical events. Factors reflecting deteriorating cardiac function were associated with a substantial increase in risk of overt heart failure. These include low vital capacity, sinus tachycardia, and ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. 
3	Ubiquitin immunoreactivity in kuru plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Cerebellar kuru plaques in 2 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were studied immunohistochemically. Similar to cerebellar senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, many kuru plaques contained ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small granular elements, presumably representing dystrophic neurites. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in neuritic changes in cerebellar plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases despite differences of amyloid proteins in the plaques. 
1	Prognostic value of c-myc proto-oncogene overexpression in early invasive carcinoma of the cervix. The prognostic effect of c-myc oncogene overexpression was assessed in a multivariate analysis of 93 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix, stage Ib, IIa, and IIb proximal. The treatment was based on the association of brachytherapy-colpohysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Analysis of c-myc gene expression was done using Northern and slot blot hybridization techniques. Overexpression of c-myc (ie, levels at least three times the mean observed in normal tissues) was present in 33% of the tumors. The proportion of carcinomas with c-myc overexpression significantly increased with the size of the primary tumor (P = .04). No relationship was found between c-myc overexpression and the other clinical and histologic parameters, including the nodal status. The relative risk of relapse (overall, pelvic failure, distant metastases) was analyzed in a Cox's proportional hazards model. Three factors were significantly related to the risk of overall relapse when the multivariate analysis was performed, namely, the tumor size, the nodal status, and c-myc expression. A combination of c-myc expression and the nodal status provided a very accurate indication of the risk of relapse. Indeed, patients with negative nodes had a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 93% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 79% to 98%) when c-myc was expressed at a normal level, whereas this rate was only 51% (95% Cl, 26% to 63%) when c-myc was overexpressed (log-rank test, P = .02). In addition, in the subgroup of patients with positive nodes, this rate was 44% (95% Cl, 25% to 77%) and 15% (95% Cl, 4% to 49%) when c-myc gene was expressed at normal level, or overexpressed, respectively. Finally, c-myc gene overexpression was, in the multivariate analysis, the first factor selected by the model regarding the risk of distant metastases. 
1	Intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer-cell and interleukin-2 therapy for malignancies limited to the peritoneal cavity. Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results. 
2	Carcinoma of the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer remains difficult to diagnose preoperatively. However, recent work suggests that ultrasound may be effective. Gallbladder cancer remains highly lethal despite aggressive therapy. Extension of the disease beyond the mucosa predicts a poor chance of long-term survival. 
4	Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439] Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose. The most common initial clinical symptom is subacute progressive dyspnea, and the initial laboratory evaluation typically shows hypoxemia in a patient with clear lung fields on a chest roentgenogram. Another distinguishing feature may be hepatic abnormalities. In general, pulmonary angiography discloses no evidence of emboli, but multiple subsegmental peripheral perfusion defects are noted on ventilation-perfusion lung scans. The diagnosis of microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism can be confirmed by open-lung or transbronchial lung biopsy or by microvascular pulmonary cytology, a less invasive procedure that could be performed at the time of pulmonary angiography. Herein we describe two patients with unsuspected microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism that eventuated in subacute cor pulmonale and death. These cases illustrate the characteristic findings of this entity and emphasize the need for early diagnosis. 
5	Obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Toward neutralization of a major risk factor. Among 57 neonates undergoing repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with severe pulmonary venous obstruction from 1980 through 1989, date of operation (1980 to 1984), preoperative hemodynamic instability, and failure to monitor pulmonary artery pressure postoperatively were risk factors for death. Thus, among the 30 patients having repair between 1985 and 1989, the 55-month survival rate including hospital deaths was 83%. 
4	The association between Type A behavior and change in coronary risk factors among young adults. The association of Type A/B behavior pattern and changes in blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, body mass, and smoking was estimated in a cohort of 375 young Black and White men and women from a rural county in Central Kentucky between 1978-79 and 1985-88. Type A participants experienced significant increases in systolic (2.90 +/- 1.29 mmHg) and diastolic (3.80 +/- 1.17 mmHg) blood pressure and in cigarette smoking (3.26 +/- 0.89 cigarettes per day) over the eight-year follow-up period, but Type B participants experienced no change. Type A and B individuals showed similar changes in total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, or body mass. Differences between behavioral types in blood pressure were present for women but not men, and for Blacks but not for Whites. These findings suggest a possible significance of the Type A pattern for the development of cardiovascular risk of young adults. 
5	Is liver transplantation justified for the treatment of hepatic malignancies? Twenty-eight patients received orthotopic liver transplants for malignant disease between February 1, 1984, and December 31, 1989. Preoperative diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), other primary hepatic tumors (n = 6), and metastatic diseases to the liver (n = 3). Overall actuarial survivals at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years were 67.3%, 51%, and 31%, respectively. Long-term survival longer than 5 years was achieved in 3 patients. The recurrence rate in patients surviving longer than 3 months is 48% (median, 7 months). Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma had the poorest survival and highest recurrence rates. Specific prognostic factors correlating with survival or recurrence could not be elucidated. These results indicate that orthotopic liver transplants can provide long-term cure and palliation for malignant disease; however, patient selection is extremely important in predicting outcome. 
2	A chronic granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. A small clinically distinct group of patients with widespread tissue granulomata are described. The principal presenting symptoms are malaise, fever, and weight loss, although a wide variety of complaints are documented. Pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The granulomata are noncaseating with a few multinucleate giant cells and some surrounding chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of an associated arteritis. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course and although it may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly if the kidneys are involved, the prognosis is relatively good. We propose that this entity be called granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. The characteristics that set this syndrome apart from the other granulomatous vasculitides are discussed. The current limited understanding of granuloma formation does not allow us to propose a definite etiology for this condition. It is emphasized that it is not helpful to encompass it within a label of sarcoidosis. First, it may only serve to confuse the doctor in assessing and treating this very particular group of patients. Secondly, it may hinder future attempts to understand the different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the various conditions in which granulomata may arise. 
1	Removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths by the hysteroscopic resectoscope. Fifty-three patients underwent 55 procedures with a resectoscope for the removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths. The presenting complaint was menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or heavy postmenopausal bleeding in 38 patients; excessive menses plus infertility in 13 patients; and infertility alone in two patients. Forty-three patients had pedunculated or sessile submucous myomas and ten patients had large endometrial polyps. The long-term results are based on 45 patients followed for longer than 1 year. Excessive bleeding was controlled in 40 of the 43 women (93%). Failure to control abnormal bleeding was apparent within the first year. Seven of the 12 infertility patients (58%) delivered live-born infants. Five patients have undergone subsequent hysterectomies (9%). Two patients had repeat resectoscopic removal of myomas and two had subsequent non-resectoscope myomectomies. No major complications were encountered. 
3	Apneic oxygenation in apnea tests for brain death. A controlled trial. We performed a prospective controlled study of apneic oxygenation on 15 patients undergoing apnea tests for brain death. All patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at existing respirator settings. During the 10-minute apnea tests, nine patients were given continuous apneic oxygenation by tracheal cannula. The other six patients had tracheal tubes open to room air. The patients given apneic oxygenation had little or no hypoxia by the end of the test. The patients given room air during the test became hypoxic. Many neurologists perform apnea tests with no oxygenation or with preoxygenation alone. This is the first prospective controlled study (to our knowledge) of apneic oxygenation; it shows that preoxygenation alone does not prevent hypoxia during apnea tests for brain death. We recommend that all apnea tests be performed with apneic oxygenation. 
1	Therapeutic dilemmas associated with antenatally detected ovarian cysts. Fifteen instances of ovarian cysts detected antenatally are reported. Seven cysts more than 5 centimeters in diameter were treated surgically because of clinical signs, such as palpable abdominal mass, vomiting and abdominal distension. Seven cysts less than 5 centimeters in diameter, and one cyst more than 5 centimeters in diameter began to regress spontaneously within six months after birth. Because the pathophysiologic nature of neonatal ovarian cysts has not been elucidated and because the borderline between physiologic and pathologic factors is still unclear, we propose a more conservative approach in the management of neonatal ovarian cysts to avoid unnecessary operations. 
2	Hyposensitivity to vasopressin in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis during acute variceal hemorrhage. It has been suggested that vasopressin given during hemorrhage may be less effective than when given during a stable state in a portal-hypertensive rat model. This study was designed to evaluate the hemodynamic response to vasopressin infusion in 25 HBsAg-positive cirrhotic patients. Nine patients had active variceal hemorrhage before vasopressin infusion, and the other 16 patients were in a stable condition at the time of infusion. The two groups of patients were similar in baseline values except that a higher heart rate was found in patients with hemorrhage (96 +/- 20 vs. 73 +/- 10 beats/min, mean +/- S.D., p less than 0.01). Thirty minutes after vasopressin infusion (0.66 units/min), hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly decreased in both bleeding and stable patients (from 21 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; and from 18 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, respectively). However, the decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient was less obvious in bleeding patients as compared with stable patients (4 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). A significant reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient after vasopressin infusion was found in five bleeding patients without shock (from a median of 16 mm Hg [range = 12 to 26] to 11 mm Hg [range = 6 to 18], p less than 0.05), but not in four bleeding patients with shock (from 28 [range = 15 to 36] to 25 [range = 18 to 33] mm Hg, p greater than 0.05). 
5	Seismic communication in a blind subterranean mammal: a major somatosensory mechanism in adaptive evolution underground. Seismic communication, through low-frequency and patterned substrate-borne vibrations that are generated by head thumping, and which travel long distances underground, is important in the nonvisual communication of subterranean mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies (2n = 52, 54, 58, and 60) in Israel. This importance pertains both intraspecifically in adaptation and interspecifically in speciation. Neurophysiologic, behavioral, and anatomic findings in this study suggest that the mechanism of long-distance seismic communication is basically somatosensory and is independent of the auditory mechanism. Seismic communication thus appears to be a channel of communication important in the evolution of subterranean mammals that display major adaptation to life underground. 
5	Age effects susceptibility to pulmonary barotrauma in rabbits. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of age on the development of pulmonary barotrauma after mechanical ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP). DESIGN: Young (4 to 6 wk old) and adult rabbits were ventilated for 1 hr at PIPs of 15, 30, and either 45 cm H2O (young group) or 55 cm H2O (adult group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) was measured in an isolated lung perfusion system after the animals were killed. In young rabbits, Kf,c increased significantly from the 15 cm H2O PIP value in both the 30 cm H2O (55%) and 45 cm H2O (507%) PIP groups, whereas Kf,c was increased in adult rabbits only in the 55 cm H2O (113%) PIP group. Kf,c was significantly (p less than .01) higher in young rabbits than in adult rabbits after ventilation, with every level of PIP being 91% higher at 15 cm H2O PIP and 440% higher at 45 to 55 cm H2O PIP. Also, a greater incidence of pneumothorax and airleaks was observed in the young rabbits. Pressure-volume loops demonstrated that the young rabbits had more compliant lungs and chest wall than adult rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the lungs of young rabbits had a higher baseline microvascular permeability and were more susceptible to the development of ventilator-induced increased microvascular permeability. More compliant lungs and chest wall and the larger distending volumes attained at each peak airway pressure appear to be the mechanisms. 
5	Pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the findings in a patient with shortness of breath due to pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy. Mediastinal recurrence of an incompletely resected and slowly growing adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left main bronchus had encased the right main pulmonary artery. 
4	Effect of Bay U 3405, a new thromboxane antagonist, on collagen-induced thromboembolism in rabbits. Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9- carbazolepropanoic acid] potently inhibits platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2-induced contraction of smooth muscles, and coronary artery thrombosis. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced sudden death by Bay U 3405. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Bay U 3405 on thromboembolism provoked by collagen. Collagen fibrils dissolved in an isotonic glucose solution were injected into a marginal ear vein of anesthetized rabbits. Sudden death occurred within a few minutes due to elevated thromboxane A2 levels causing intravascular platelet aggregation and myocardial ischemia. In the vehicle-treated group, 100% of the animals died. One of the most prominent parameters was the massive fall in blood pressure. All animals pretreated with 10 mg/kg orally Bay U 3405 survived, showing only a transient hypotensive effect. Tracings of the electrocardiogram and heart rate were unchanged. Bay U 3405 will therefore be useful to elucidate the role of thromboxane A2 in various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. 
1	Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
5	Recurrent herpes gestationis with postpartum flare: a case report. A case of herpes gestationis recurring in each pregnancy, with a postpartum flare-up in the last pregnancy, is described. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy. The first pregnancy ended in a term stillbirth, but there were favorable outcomes in four subsequent pregnancies. Histopathologic examination of the placentas of the last three pregnancies revealed varying grades of villositis. Symptoms improved with oral corticosteroids. 
5	Clinical efficacy of oral-transdermal clonidine combinations during the perioperative period. In an attempt to maintain stable levels of an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist throughout the perioperative period, two different oral-transdermal clonidine dosage regimens were administered according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. We determined the clinical efficacy of a high- and a low-dose clonidine regimen on sedation, hemodynamic parameters, anesthesia, and analgesia. The low-dose clonidine group of patients (n = 14) received a 7-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #2), which was supplemented with oral doses of clonidine approximately 3 micrograms.kg-1 on the evening prior to surgery and on the morning of surgery. The high-dose clonidine group (n = 14) received a 10.5-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #3) with oral clonidine approximately 4.5 micrograms.kg-1 at bedtime and 6.0 micrograms.kg-1 on the morning of surgery. Placebo-treated (control) patients received the same occlusive patch without active ingredient and oral placebo tablets at bedtime and on the morning of surgery. Preanesthetic medication included midazolam 50 micrograms.kg-1 intramuscularly (im). Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1 intravenously (iv), thiopental 3 mg.kg-1 iv, and vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 iv, and was maintained with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and a continuous infusion of alfentanil 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Isoflurane was added when the blood pressure exceeded 110% of the patient's prestudy value. For pain relief postoperatively, the patients received morphine, 1-2-mg iv boluses, via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. The low-dose clonidine patient group had mean plasma clonidine concentrations that varied from 1.47 ng.ml-1 (preoperative) to 1.32 ng.ml-1 (postoperative day 2). 
3	Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. Electron microscopic study of the skin lesion. The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination. Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei. On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be "crystal ghosts," presumably of tyrosine. The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. 
2	Frequency of recovery of Blastocystis hominis in clinical practice. We examined the frequency of isolation of Blastocystis hominis from stools of patients seen in an indigent-care teaching hospital. Over a 2-year period, 2,744 stool specimens were examined prospectively. B. hominis was found in 262 stools (9.5% of all stool specimens and 53.5% of the positive specimens). Clinical data were obtained from 80 patients with stools positive for B. hominis. B. hominis was the only parasite isolated in 39 of 47 (83%) of the adults, compared with 17 of 33 (52%) of the children (p = 0.006). All but 2 of 52 patients without concomitant parasitic infection or bacterial pathogens in stool had gastrointestinal symptoms (41 abdominal pain, 26 diarrhea, and 5 vomiting), but no association was seen with fever, peripheral leukocytosis, stool occult blood, fecal leukocytes, or endoscopic or radiologic evidence of colitis. Therefore, B. hominis was frequently recovered from stools examined in a hospital clinical parasitology laboratory. The clinical presentations of patients in our series did not suggest that B. hominis was invasive. Most patients with B. hominis probably do not require treatment since they will either have spontaneous resolution of symptoms or will be found to have an alternative explanation for their problem. 
4	Lipoprotein (a) and coronary heart disease: a prospective case-control study in a general population sample of middle aged men. OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration and subsequent coronary heart disease. DESIGN--Prospective case-control study based on a six year follow up of a general population sample of men aged 50 at baseline in 1983-4. Serum samples were frozen at the time of the baseline examination and kept at -70 degrees C for six years, after which the lipoprotein (a) concentrations in the samples were measured in cases and controls. SETTING--City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS--26 Men, from a general population sample of 776 men, who had sustained a myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the six years and 109 randomly selected controls from the same sample who had remained free of myocardial infarction. In neither cases nor controls was there a history of myocardial infarction at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Proportion of myocardial infarction or deaths from coronary heart disease, or both, in relation to the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration. RESULTS--Men who suffered coronary heart disease had significantly higher serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations than controls (mean difference 105 mg/l; 95% confidence interval 18 to 192 mg/l). Men with the highest fifth of serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations (cut off point 365 mg/l) suffered a coronary heart disease rate which was more than twice that of men with the lowest four fifths of concentrations. Logistic regression analysis showed the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration to be significantly associated with coronary heart disease independently of other risk factors. CONCLUSION--The serum lipoprotein (a) concentration in middle aged men is an independent risk factor for subsequent myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. 
1	Primary carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Effect of primary and secondary therapy on survival. The pathologic material and medical records of 76 patients with primary upper urinary tract carcinomas were reviewed to identify the role of grade and stage in predicting survival; to determine any differences in survival between ureteral and renal pelvic carcinoma; to understand the role of local therapy in low grade, low stage tumors; and to establish the usefulness of adjuvant therapies in metastatic disease. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with Cox-Mantel analysis for statistical significance revealed both grade and stage to be excellent predictors of survival. No differences in survival were noted between renal pelvic and ureteral carcinomas for equivalent stage tumors. For low grade, low stage tumors, although there was an increased risk of local recurrence with local therapy, there were no differences in survival between patients treated with local therapy or radical surgery. Finally, cisplatin-based chemotherapy seemed to improve survival in patients with metastatic disease. 
5	Drop attacks with Meniere's syndrome. We report the clinical features of 12 patients with drop attacks associated with Meniere's syndrome. Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall. These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome. The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient. In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress. These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear. They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks. 
1	The oncologic risks of skin preservation at mastectomy when combined with immediate reconstruction of the breast. Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast. There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin. Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence. To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied. Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances. All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months. One peripheral local recurrence was observed. This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients. 
3	Thrombocytosis after pneumonia with empyema and other bacterial infections in children. Thrombocytosis is seen in association with many conditions, including infectious diseases. We studied thrombocytosis after severe bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia with empyema in children. A systematic survey of the phenomenon was conducted. Twenty-seven children admitted for pneumonia with empyema were studied. Thrombocytosis (platelet counts greater than 500 x 10(3)/microliters) was present in 92.5%. Platelet counts reached their maximum at 15.1 +/- 3.7 days (range, 7 to 25) and declined to normal after 3 weeks of illness. Compared with a healthy control group, significant thrombocytosis, but of lower incidence, was also noted in children with lobar pneumonia without pleural effusion, bacterial meningitis and osteomyelitis. Platelet functions were examined in seven of the children but no abnormalities were observed. Bone marrow aspiration of three children with pneumonia and empyema showed megakaryocytic hyperplasia. We found no correlation between thrombocytosis, neutrophilia, fever, the clinical course, complications, prognosis or treatment. Neither thromboembolic nor hemorrhagic phenomena were observed. 
4	Discrepancies in the measurement of isovolumic relaxation time: a study comparing M mode and Doppler echocardiography. Mitral valve cusp separation on M mode echogram, the mitral valve opening artefact, and the onset of forward transmitral flow recorded by Doppler echocardiography have all been taken to mark the end of isovolumic relaxation, while its onset has been taken either as the aortic closure sound (A2) recorded phonocardiographically or the aortic closure artefact determined by Doppler technique. Possible differences in the measurement of the isovolumic relaxation time were studied when these landmarks were used in 44 healthy people, 14 patients with mitral stenosis, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by recording M mode echograms of the mitral valve, and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra of transmitral flow, with simultaneous electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms. A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However, when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation, the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals, by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation. These intervals cannot be used interchangeably to measure "isovolumic relaxation time". 
1	Reviewing the unicystic ameloblastoma: report of two cases. Classification of ameloblastoma into solid, multicystic, unicystic, and peripheral types based on clinical appearance and effects has gained recent recognition. The unicystic ameloblastoma is a less encountered variant of the ameloblastoma. It appears more frequently in the second or third decade with no sexual or racial predilection. It is almost exclusively encountered asymptomatically in the posterior mandible. The following report of two cases discusses the pathophysiology, demographics, histology, and prognosis of the unicystic ameloblastoma. 
1	Radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radioactive gold seed placement: results of treatment at 5 and 10 years for clinical stages A2, B1 and B2 cancer of the prostate. Between 1977 and 1988, 131 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent combined radical prostatectomy and intraoperative radioactive gold seed placement. Of these 131 patients 80 were clinically assessed as having stage A2 (12), B1 (43) or B2 (25) cancer and they are the subject of this review. The average dose of radioactivity administered to each patient was 96.6 mCi, and mean followup was 65 months (median 64 months). No patient in this series received any other form of adjuvant therapy until disease recurrence was demonstrated. Local recurrences were observed in 2 patients (2.5%) in this series while distant recurrences were observed in 10 (12.5%). Cancer specific survival free of disease at 5 years was 100% for clinical stage A2, 91% for B1 and 75% for B2 cancers. The 10-year survival free of disease was 100% for clinical stage A2, 82% for B1 and 68% for B2 cancers. Covariants of clinical stage and seminal vesicle involvement influenced survival free of disease in a statistically significant manner (p less than 0.05) while pathological stage and degree of tumor differentiation did not. Mild to severe complications were observed in 12 patients (15%). Intraoperative placement of radioactive gold seeds into unresected pelvic tissues surrounding the site of prostatectomy offers a theoretical advantage in treatment by delivering tumoricidal levels of irradiation to residual foci of cancer not appreciated at the time of surgery. Our results suggest that increases in cancer specific survival free of disease over that previously reported for prostatectomy alone may be achieved through this combined treatment regimen. Furthermore, it is our opinion that therapeutic gains can be achieved without the attendant increases in morbidity and treatment delay often associated with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. 
2	Postoperative pancreatic abscess due to Plesiomonas shigelloides. Plesiomonas shigelloides is being recognized with increasing frequency as a human pathogen. The organism is ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water, and clinical illness has been associated with foreign travel and ingestion of inadequately cooked seafood. We describe a 64-year-old Filipino woman who presented 2 weeks after elective cholecystectomy and pancreatic biopsy with left upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention, and fever. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed an abscess in the tail of the pancreas with fluid accumulation in the lesser omental sac. Percutaneous aspiration yielded purulent material, and P. shigelloides was recovered in pure culture. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic abscess due to P. shigelloides. 
5	Rhodopsin mutants that bind but fail to activate transducin. Rhodopsin is a member of a family of receptors that contain seven transmembrane helices and are coupled to G proteins. The nature of the interactions between rhodopsin mutants and the G protein, transduction (Gt), was investigated by flash photolysis in order to monitor directly Gt binding and dissociation. Three mutant opsins with alterations in their cytoplasmic loops bound 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments with native rhodopsin absorption spectra, but they failed to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gt. The opsin mutations included reversal of a charged pair conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane helix (mutant CD1), replacement of 13 amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop (mutant CD2), and deletion of 13 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic loop (mutant EF1). Whereas mutant CD1 failed to bind Gt, mutants CD2 and EF1 showed normal Gt binding but failed to release Gt in the presence of guanosine triphosphate. Therefore, it appears that at least the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are required for activation of bound Gt. 
1	Mesangial cell accessory functions: mediation by intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is an early pathologic alteration characteristic of many forms of immune mediated glomerulonephritis. The intracapillary position, contractile capacity, and production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules place MC in a pivotal position to initiate, mediate, and direct glomerular damage. We as well as others have noted increased levels of cytokines including IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1 and the cell surface MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules in the kidneys of mice with lupus nephritis. MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules are central to the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cells (APC). Since cytokines can increase both MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules, we investigated whether mesangial cells could function as APC or accessory cells after cytokine stimulation. For these studies we established a permanent MC line through transformation with origin-deficient SV40 DNA. Surface expression of ICAM-1 was similar in untransformed MC as well as SV40 transformed MC from normal mice and in untransformed cells from mice with lupus nephritis. Basal expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated rapidly by IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1. MHC class II expression could not be induced with TNF or IL-1 alone but required prolonged stimulation with IFN gamma. MC adhered and presented antigen to an antigen specific IaK restricted T cell hybridoma. Anti-ICAM-1 mAb decreased adhesion and antigen presentation of cytokine stimulated MC. By comparison, MHC class II mAb abrogated antigen presentation by MC bearing MHC class II but did not block adhesion. 
2	A prospective analysis of 1518 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The Southern Surgeons Club. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The Southern Surgeons Club conducted a prospective study of 1518 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treatment of gallbladder disease in order to evaluate the safety of this procedure. RESULTS. Seven hundred fifty-eight operations (49.9 percent) were performed at academic hospitals, and 760 (50.1 percent) at private hospitals. In 72 patients (4.7 percent) the operation was converted to conventional open cholecystectomy; the most common reason for the change was the inability to identify the anatomy of the gallbladder as a result of inflammation in the region of this organ. A total of 82 complications occurred in 78 (5.1 percent) of the patients; this is comparable with the rates of 6 to 21 percent that have been reported for conventional cholecystectomy. Overall, the most common complication was superficial infection of the site of insertion of the umbilical trocar. A total of seven injuries to the common bile duct or the hepatic duct occurred during the operation, for a rate of 0.5 percent. Four of the seven injuries were simple lacerations, which were repaired after conversion to conventional cholecystectomy. The incidence of bile-duct injury in the first 13 patients operated on by each surgical group was 2.2 percent, as compared with 0.1 percent for subsequent patients. No complications were attributed directly to either cautery or laser-surgical technique, and similar numbers of complications occurred in academic and private hospitals. The mean hospital stay for the entire group was 1.2 days (range, 6 hours to 30 days). CONCLUSIONS. The results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy compare favorably with those of conventional cholecystectomy with respect to mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay. A slightly higher incidence of biliary injury with the laparoscopic procedure is probably offset by the low incidence of other complications. 
1	Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of main pancreatic duct stenosis under pancreatographic guidance. When pancreatography shows a stenosis of the main pancreatic duct in patients with normal or inconclusive ultrasound and computed tomography, the exact nature of such stenosis is sometimes difficult to precise before surgical exploration. In such cases, the authors systematically performed a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of the stenosis under pancreatographic guidance. Fifteen patients were referred because of suspected pancreatic malignancy. The tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were normal in 11 patients and elevated in one patient, whereas only CA 19-9 was elevated in three others. In 14 cases, both the ultrasound and computed tomography did not show any obvious pancreatic mass. The pancreatography was done through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (12 patients) or percutaneously in case of failure at ERCP3 and showed a main pancreatic duct stenosis that underwent aspiration by percutaneous fine needle precisely positioned using biplane fluoroscopy. The aspirated material was then smeared on glass slides, air-dried, and stained by Giemsa. In nine of the 15 patients, cytologic study revealed adenocarcinoma. This was confirmed by surgery in five and by progressive deterioration followed by death in four. In six patients, cytologic study gave a nonmalignant result. Chronic pancreatitis was found in five of them, confirmed at surgery in three and based on uneventful follow-up of at least 12 months in two others. In one case, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma not detected by cytologic study was found at surgery. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic approach were 90% and 100%, respectively. No serious complication was noticed. The authors conclude that when ultrasound and computed tomography are inconclusive, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of main pancreatic duct stenosis under pancreatographic guidance is a safe, simple, and helpful procedure in the investigation of patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy. 
5	Allograft tympanoplasty: predictive value of preoperative status. The functional and anatomical results of a series of 181 consecutive allograft tympanoplasties for ears with drum perforation and an intact ossicular chain were retrospectively reviewed and related to preoperative factors. Drum closure was realized in 92% (166 of 181 cases evaluated 1 year after surgery), and 96.6% of the reconstructed drums were still intact 3 years after surgery (118 cases evaluated). An air-bone gap of less than 21 dB was reached in 79.6% (of a total of 162 cases) 1 year after surgery, and in 78% (of a total of 118 cases) 3 years after surgery. Age, contralateral pathology, the wet or dry status of the ear preoperatively, and the preoperative air-bone gap had no influence on anatomical results. The preoperative air-bone gap did not predict the postoperative air-bone gap. The influence of age and existence of contralateral pathology on hearing gain was only visible in some of the strictly defined patient groups. The wet preoperative status of the ear generally predicted lower functional gain. 
3	Intrathecal baclofen for spasticity in cerebral palsy Seventeen patients with congenital spastic cerebral palsy and six patients with other forms of spasticity were injected intrathecally with doses of placebo or baclofen, 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, or 100 micrograms, in a randomized, double-blind manner. Muscle tone in the upper and lower extremities was assessed by Ashworth scores both before the injections and every 2 hours afterward for 8 hours. Function of the upper extremities was evaluated before the injections and 4 hours afterward. Muscle tone in the lower extremities was significantly decreased within 2 hours after baclofen injection and remained lower than baseline 8 hours afterward. Upper extremity tone and function were not significantly affected by these single doses. Confusion and drowsiness occurred in two of the youngest children in the study after the 50-micrograms dose, but cleared within 2 hours. Our findings indicate that intrathecal baclofen reduces spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, as it does in adults with spasticity of spinal origin. 
2	Interleukin 1 beta is expressed predominantly by enterocytes in experimental colitis. The cytokine interleukin 1 beta is an important mediator of inflammatory processes capable of inducing eicosanoid production, T-cell activation, and increased vascular permeability. In this study, in situ hybridization techniques were used to delineate the kinetics and cellular source of induced interleukin 1 beta in acute experimental colitis. The induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA was an early phenomenon and occurred predominantly in undifferentiated cells located in the basal part of the mucosal crypts but not in differentiated enterocytes. The undifferentiated enterocytes retained the messenger RNA during differentiation and migration to more apical parts of the crypts. These results suggest that induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA in enterocytes is causally related to the subsequent inflammatory changes seen in acute experimental colitis. 
3	Embolism of cerebral tissue: a cause of coagulopathy and cerebral infarction? Report of a case. We report a case of potentially survivable closed head injury, which was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and bilateral cerebral infarction. Autopsy disclosed pulmonary emboli composed of cerebral tissue. We suggest that the entry of brain tissue into the systemic blood circulation caused severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, with consequent thrombosis of cerebral veins and spreading infarction. 
5	Long-term suppression of tremor by chronic stimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus. The usefulness of high-frequency stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) as the first neurosurgical procedure in disabling tremor was assessed in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease and 6 with essential tremor. 7 of these patients had already undergone thalamotomy contralateral to the stimulated side, and 11 others had bilateral Vim stimulation at the same time. Chronic stimulating electrodes connected to a pulse generator were implanted in the Vim. Tremor amplitude at rest, during posture holding, and during action and intention manoeuvres was assessed by means of accelerometry. Of the 43 thalami stimulated, 27 showed complete relief from tremor and 11 major improvement (88%). The improvement was maintained for up to 29 months (mean follow-up 13 [SD 9] months). Adverse effects were mild and could be eradicated by reduction or cessation of stimulation. This reversibility and adaptability, allowing control of side-effects, make thalamic stimulation preferable to thalamotomy, especially when treatment of both sides of the brain is needed. 
4	Endothelin family in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. To clarify whether endothelin may be present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if it exists, to compare its molecular forms with those of endothelin in human plasma, we analyzed pooled human CSF and plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with specific enzyme immunoassays for each endothelin peptide. Of the four human endothelin peptides hitherto identified, big endothelin-1 was the major molecular form of endothelin present in human CSF. In addition, there was a small but significant amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in CSF, while endothelin-2 was not detectable. Similarly, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 were identified in human plasma. Although big endothelin-1 was the most abundant, a substantial amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 was found in plasma with a resultant lower molar ratio of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 than in CSF. In all CSF samples from 17 patients requiring diagnostic lumbar puncture or lumbar anesthesia, endothelin was detectable, with a preponderance of big endothelin-1 relative to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. The mean concentrations of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in simultaneously collected plasma were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those in CSF, while there was no significant difference between the mean big endothelin-1 concentration in plasma and that in CSF. There was no significant correlation among concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 in each paired sample. These results indicate that endothelin is present in human CSF that is differently processed from endothelin in vascular endothelial cells and suggest a possible role for endothelin as a modulator of neuronal functions. 
1	Gastric lymphoma causing granulocytopenia and cold intolerance, with recovery after treatment. A 34-year-old man was found to have granulocytopenia with a white blood count of 2.3 x 10(9) l-1, consisting of 10% segmented neutrophils, 50% monocytes and 40% lymphocytes. A bone marrow aspirate showed 20% promyelocytes and 10% blasts with monoblastic features, and a smouldering myelomonocytic leukaemia was considered to be a possible diagnosis. In cold weather the patient experienced cold intolerance with acrocyanosis and small ulcerations on the ears. The test for heparin-precipitable protein ('cryofibrinogen') was strongly positive. During the following year, these signs and symptoms persisted, and the patient also developed constant moderate pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy revealed a large lymphoma of the stomach, which was a high-grade malignant centroblastic type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After successful removal of the tumour, and six courses of potent cytostatic combinations, the patient recovered completely, and the granulocytopenia and cold intolerance disappeared. 
4	Angiotensin II levels in hypertensive and normotensive pregnancies. We measured circulating angiotension II by radioimmunoassay in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 54), and compared these values with those obtained in women with normal pregnancy (n = 18) and in non pregnant women (n = 20). Pregnant women had statistically significantly higher plasma angiotensin II [mean (SD): 41.3 (12.6) pg/ml] than non-pregnant women [29.2 (11.3) pg/ml; P less than 0.004]. Angiotensin II concentrations in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension [mean (SD): 31.7 (16.2) pg/ml] were, on average, 25% lower than in normal pregnancy (P less than 0.003) and resembled those obtained in non-pregnant women. The lowest angiotensin II levels were found in women with more severe forms of pregnancy-induced hypertension, such as proteinuric or superimposed pregnancy-induced hypertension. Review of the published studies on angiotensin II and our data suggest that the conflict among studies on angiotensin II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension is largely due to the heterogeneity of the study populations in the various reports. 
1	Role of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 170 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, ultrasound showed a high sensitivity in identifying focal liver lesions. Fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by ultrasound yielded a pathological diagnosis in the majority of cases. The advantages of this technique, its high diagnostic yield and low cost, render the older technique of blind percutaneous biopsy using a coarse needle obsolete. Laparoscopy retains its essential role in selected cases. Complementary use of fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance and laparoscopy assures the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma. We confirm the poor sensitivity of alpha fetoprotein. 
3	Low plasma iron status and akathisia. Thirty patients were examined to test the hypothesis that a depletion of iron levels is associated with symptoms of akathisia. Fifteen akathisic patients were pair-matched with 15 non-akathisic patients. Plasma ferritin levels were significantly decreased in the akathisic patients, and there was a significant inverse correlation between plasma iron levels and akathisia rating. In addition, akathisia ratings were found to be correlated with a scale measuring symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. 
5	Hepatic oxygen and lactate extraction during stagnant hypoxia. As O2 delivery falls, tissues must extract increasing amounts of O2 from blood to maintain a normal O2 consumption. Below a critical delivery threshold, increases in O2 extraction cannot compensate for the falling delivery, and O2 uptake falls in a supply-dependent fashion. Numerous studies have identified a critical delivery in whole animals, but the regional contributions to the critical O2 delivery are less fully understood. In the present study, we explored the limits of O2 extraction in the isolated liver, seeking to determine 1) the normal relationship between O2 consumption and delivery in the liver and 2) the relationship of hepatic lactate extraction to the drop in hepatic O2 consumption at low O2 deliveries. To answer these questions, using support dogs as a source for oxygenated metabolically stable blood, we studied eight pump-perfused canine livers. By lowering the blood flow in a model of stagnant hypoxia, we explored the relationship between O2 consumption and delivery over the entire physiological range of O2 delivery. The critical O2 delivery was 28 +/- 5 (SD) ml.kg-1.min-1; the livers extracted 68 +/- 9% of the delivered O2 before reaching supply dependence. This suggests that the liver has an O2 extraction capacity quite similar to the body as a whole and not different from other tissues that have been isolated. At high blood flows, the livers extracted approximately 10% of the lactate delivered by the blood, but the arteriovenous lactate differences were small. At low blood flows, however, the livers changed from lactate consumption to production. The O2 delivery coinciding with the dropoff in lactate extraction did not differ significantly from the critical O2 delivery. We conclude that reductions in lactate uptake by the liver do not precede the transition to O2 supply dependence. 
5	The t(1;19)(q23;p13) results in consistent fusion of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocation is observed cytogenetically in 25% of children with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is associated with an adverse treatment outcome. The t(1;19) juxtaposes the E2A gene from chromosome 19 with the PBX1 gene on chromosome 1, leading to the production of fusion transcripts and resultant chimeric proteins that contain the transcriptional-activating motif of E2A and the DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. To investigate the molecular nature of E2A/PBX1 fusion in patients with t(1;19) ALL we used an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to amplify a portion of the chimeric transcript. We detected E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts in cells from 97% (37 of 38) of cases in which the t(1;19) had been observed cytogenetically. Molecular evidence of E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts was also observed in a patient in whom a t(1;19) was not detected cytogenetically and in one patient with subclinical levels of minimal residual disease before overt clinical relapse. In all PCR-positive cases the junction of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences occurred at precisely the same location as demonstrated by hybridization of PCR products with a fusion site-specific detection oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate the consistent fusion of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences resulting from t(1;19) and suggest that site-specific fusion of E2A and PBX1 is an important pathogenic event in t(1;19) ALL. 
4	Role of ultrasonic tissue characterization to distinguish reversible from irreversible myocardial injury. Tissue characterization reflects structural and functional integrity of tissues. Inasmuch as reversible ischemia causes no structural damage and irreversible ischemia results in persistent structural myocardial damage, we postulated that ultrasonic tissue characterization can distinguish the two types of injuries. Anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 15 minutes (group 1, n = 5) and 90 minutes (group 2, n = 8) of acute total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia-infarction was confirmed with segment shortening, electronmicroscopic examination, and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5 (IBR5), a measure of ultrasonic backscatter, and Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle dependent variation in backscatter, were measured at baseline, during ischemia, and after reperfusion. Group 1 (reversible ischemia) showed an increase in IBR5 from -48 +/- 1.2 dB at control to -45 +/- 1.0 dB (p less than 0.01) during ischemia, which returned to baseline after reperfusion (-47 +/- 1.3 dB). FAM was blunted during ischemia (6.2 +/- 1.0 dB during control versus 1.2 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered completely during reperfusion. Segment shortening was abolished during ischemia (18% +/- 3% during control versus -12% +/- 5% during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered partially during reperfusion (4% +/- 5%). The group 2 animals with irreversible myocardial injury showed an increase in IBR5, from -49 +/- 1.2 dB during control to -44 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia (p less than 0.01) and paradoxical bulging of the ischemic region (17% +/- 3% to -7% +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) during ischemia. 
5	Neurodevelopmental performance of very-low-birth-weight infants with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage. Outcome at 5 to 6 years of age. The neurodevelopmental outcome of 38 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birth weight, less than 1501 g) was followed up prospectively from birth to 5 to 6 years of age to assess the neurodevelopmental sequelae of mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades I and II). All neonates were screened for periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage at 5 to 10 days of age. Eleven incurred a mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 1) and 27 had no periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 2). Each of the infants was neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 to 2 years of age. The 38 children were matched by race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with control children (group 3) who had been born at term. On outcome measurements at 5 to 6 years of age, groups 1 and 2 scored significantly lower than group 3 on the combined test measurements and on three of the four individual measurements. Group 1 scored significantly lower than group 2 on the combined test measurements only. These data indicate that very-low-birth-weight infants are at risk for learning problems. Although children with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage did not demonstrate a significant deficit on individual test scores, the significant difference on the combined battery suggests that mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage has an adverse effect on global performance. 
3	The effect of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to a change in heart rate. The ventricular effective refractory period was measured at a basic drive cycle length of 500 msec with basic drive train durations of two beats, eight beats, 20 beats and 3 minutes. The ventricular refractory periods were measured in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the drive train duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness by 5% (p less than 0.001) at each drive train duration. Mexiletine did not affect the ventricular effective refractory period at any of the drive train durations. In a control group of 20 subjects, there were no significant differences between two determinations of refractoriness at each basic drive train duration. In conclusion, neither quinidine nor mexiletine affect the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. Although the ventricular effective refractory period measured with a conventional basic drive train duration of eight beats is often more than 20 msec longer than the actual ventricular effective refractory period measured with a drive train duration of 3 minutes, the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the conventionally measured ventricular effective refractory period accurately reflect the effects of these drugs on the actual ventricular effective refractory period. 
4	Mechanical factors in large artery disease and antihypertensive drugs. Hypertension may induce early alterations in large arteries by 2 mechanical stresses: one related to intravascular pressure, the other to blood flow dynamics. Distending pressure force acts in a circumferential direction, inducing decreased arterial distensibility. Arterial distensibility can be evaluated in humans by measurement of arterial compliance and pulse-wave velocity. It is well established that in chronic hypertension age and elevated pressure act together to increase arterial rigidity. Blood flow dynamics induce frictional forces in the endothelial surfaces of arteries. These forces, expressed by shear stress, are proportional to the viscosity of the blood and to the velocity gradient at the arterial wall. Measurement of blood viscosity and evaluation of velocity profile in the brachial arteries of hypertensive subjects have shown a reduction in wall shear rate and stress despite the elevation in blood viscosity. Several studies have shown that drug therapy that successfully reduces blood pressure does not necessarily improve arterial compliance. In contrast, few data are available on the effects of antihypertensive medication on arterial wall shear in humans. Arterial compliance and wall shear stress are 2 main therapeutic targets of potential importance in the physiopharmacologic approach to the effects of hypertension on atherogenesis. 
5	Reconstruction of the severely atrophic edentulous mandible by means of autogenous bone grafts and simultaneous placement of osseointegrated implants. A method of reconstructing the severely atrophic mandible that simultaneously provides additional strength and the ability to house osseointegrated implants is presented. The performance of the procedure from an external approach minimizes the possibility of oral contamination and, therefore, infection. The procedure has been performed on 10 patients, with a longest follow-up of 3 years. A 93% success rate has been achieved, and bone resorption at the implant sites has thus far been negligible. Prosthetic rehabilitation has been done in 9 of the 10 cases; 3 have been tissue-supported prostheses, and 6 have been completely implant-supported prostheses. 
4	Intraoperative transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography for evaluation of residual regurgitation after mitral valve repair. Because mitral valve competence after mitral valve reconstruction is awkward to assess during this procedure, we evaluated in this respect transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography in 23 patients undergoing mitral valve reconstruction for severe mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic examinations were performed after induction of anesthesia but before sternotomy (baseline), after mitral valve repair before decannulation, and at sternal closure, all at similar mean aortic pressure and echocardiographic instrument settings. The degree of mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color Doppler flow mapping was visually quantified on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), pending the left atrial extent of the regurgitant jet. This was compared with the degree of mitral regurgitation by left ventricular cineangiography performed within several weeks after operation and also visually quantified on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with use of the right anterior oblique projection. There was good correlation between the two methods (r = 0.83; p less than 0.001). We conclude that residual mitral regurgitation, as assessed by transesophageal color flow mapping in the operating room, highly correlates with the ultimate mitral regurgitation by cineangiography. Therefore transesophageal echocardiography can be helpful for evaluation of mitral valve competence during mitral valve reconstruction, and hence, in case of repair failure, allow valve replacement in the same surgical session, thus avoiding reoperation. 
2	Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen as biochemical markers of growth activity were compared in 46 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type I procollagen (r = 0.65; P less than 0.001) and type III procollagen concentrations (r = 0.64; P less than 0.001). Although the serum concentration of type I procollagen was generally about 15 times greater than that of type III, the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001) at all growth velocities. The use of daily corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly lower concentrations of both propeptides (P less than 0.01) than was alternate-day or no corticosteroid therapy, respectively. Children with growth arrest (0.0 cm/mo) had type I and type III procollagen concentrations similar to those found in adults. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that routine measurement of collagen propeptides may have clinical value in monitoring normal and abnormal growth. The data suggest that the measurement of one propeptide does not offer an advantage over the other. 
5	Role of phenytoin in healing of large abscess cavities. The promotion of healing of large abscess cavities attained with topical phenytoin was evaluated in controlled studies of clinical and experimental wounds. In the clinical abscess cavities, phenytoin application in 20 patients compared with conventional treatment in 20 patients resulted in earlier separation of slough, decrease in oedema, control of pain and overall enhanced healing. The mean(s.d.) rate of reduction of wound area was 2.02(0.48) cm2/day in the phenytoin group versus 1.58(0.51) cm2/day in controls (P less than 0.05) on day 10, and 1.8(0.32) cm2/day versus 1.19(0.21) cm2/day (P less than 0.01) on day 20. The mean volume reduction rates at both the 10th and 20th day were 0.48(0.01) cm3/day for phenytoin versus 0.32(0.04) cm3/day for controls; (P less than 0.005). By day 20, 17 of the patients treated with phenytoin were rated as having healed completely, compared with only one of the controls. In a standardized guinea-pig model of the clinical abscess cavity, which included inoculation of the wound with Bacillus proteus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, an enhanced healing rate was also observed (at 7 days 0.40(0.05) cm2/day with phenytoin versus 0.21(0.08) cm2/day in controls; P less than 0.005). All eight of the animals treated with phenytoin healed by day 21, compared with one of the eight controls. Biopsies of wounds treated with phenytoin showed less inflammation, no necrosis, and enhanced neovascularization, collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation compared to controls. Bacterial colonies also decreased more rapidly with the use of phenytoin. 
1	Biopsy of the breast for mammographically detected lesions. We prospectively studied 718 women who underwent biopsy of the breast for suspicious, mammographically detected mammary lesions in an attempt to identify key clinical risk factors, as well as roentgenographic characteristics associated with the appearance of early carcinoma of the breast. Patients with a benign outcome had an average age of 55 years versus 63 years for patients with carcinoma of the breast. Seventy-six per cent of these patients had no previous history of mammary problems, 20 per cent had a positive family history for carcinoma of the breast, 58 per cent were premenopausal and 21 per cent had used birth control pills. Except for age (p less than 0.001), the distribution of clinical risk factors was equal among patients with benign or malignant outcomes. Suspicious mammographic findings included mass lesions (53 per cent), calcifications (36 per cent) and the association of both (11 per cent). The predominant Wolfe pattern on mammography was P1 (36 per cent). No relationship was observed between Wolfe pattern and malignant conditions. In this group of patients, mammography was poorly specific; however, the positive predictive value increased with age and is related to the age-specific prevalence of carcinoma of the breast. Eight hundred and twenty-five lesions were removed. Twenty-five per cent (n = 203) of the specimens taken at biopsy contained carcinoma. Stellate mass lesions were highly suggestive of a malignant growth (p less than 0.0001). No relationship between the size of the suspicious mammographic mass and the malignant lesion was observed. A marked correlation (chi-square test with Yate's correction) was observed between malignant tumor and lesions with a linear or branching pattern, more than 15 calcifications, or small sized calcifications. The presence of a mass with calcifications was associated with carcinoma in 34 per cent. The incidence of invasive carcinoma was much higher for mass lesions (81 per cent) than for suspicious calcifications (56 per cent) (p less than 0.0001). 
3	Intracranial aneurysms: interventional neurovascular treatment with detachable balloons--results in 215 cases Patients with complex or surgically difficult intracranial aneurysms are being treated with interventional neurovascular techniques. With neuroleptic anesthesia and a transfemoral femoral approach, a silicone micro-balloon can be flow directed through the intracranial circulation, guided directly into the aneurysm, and detached. The aneurysm is thus eliminated from the circulation, and the parent artery is preserved. For broad-based or ectatic aneurysms, test occlusion followed by permanent occlusion of the aneurysm and parent vessel can be performed. Since 1981, 211 patients with 215 aneurysms, including 177 cases involving the anterior and 38 cases involving the posterior circulation, have been treated with this technique. In 127 cases (59.1%), the parent vessel was occluded; in 88 cases (40.9%), primary occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent artery. Therapy-related complications included 21 deaths (9.8%) and 16 strokes (7.4%). Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months after treatment, and follow-up ranged from 5 months to 9 years. In patients in whom standard surgical therapy fails or for aneurysms in surgically inaccessible anatomic locations, interventional techniques that make use of detachable balloons may be a useful therapeutic alternative. 
2	Alpha 1-antitrypsin granules in the liver--always important? We have studied the clinical histories and liver biopsy findings in 1951 consecutive adult patients with suspected chronic liver disease, and in four known PiZ-homozygous alpha 1-antitrypsin-deficient patients with emphysema (candidates for lung transplant) and no known liver disease, in order to assess the importance of periportal alpha 1-antitrypsin granules in the liver and their possible causal role in liver disease, and to assess the value of possible screening tests. Periportal granules were found in 30 (1.5 per cent) of the 1951 liver biopsies and in all four known PiZ-homozygous subjects. They were the sole putative aetiological agent in eight of 85 patients (9.4 per cent) with otherwise cryptogenic cirrhosis and present in 2.5 per cent of patients with cirrhosis of known aetiology (alcohol, autoimmune etc.). All but one were Z phenotype (seven homozygotes, 22 heterozygotes). alpha 1-Antitrypsin granules were seen in 12 patients (including three of four lung transplant candidates) with no histological chronic liver disease. Determination of serum alpha 1-antitrypsin levels was quite unhelpful in identifying these patients. This study does not support the concept that periportal alpha 1-antitrypsin granules are necessarily pathogenic, but in some cases they may be causally related to otherwise cryptogenic liver disease. The presence of granules gave no important diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic information. 
1	Generation of human monoclonal antibodies against colon cancer. Lymphocytes from regional lymph nodes of patients with colon cancer were fused with a human lymphoblastoid cell line with or without in vitro immunization. The efficacy of these two protocols for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against colon cancer was investigated. The hyperplastic lymph nodes adjacent to the tumor were the best source of B lymphocytes. Fusion frequency and the number of tumor-reactive clones were markedly increased when the in vitro immunization protocol was applied prior to fusion. As a stimulant in in vitro immunization, the supernatant of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes was superior to the supernatant of mixed lymphocytes culture. Carcinoembryonic antigen at 20 micrograms/L seemed to be the optimal dose for in vitro immunization. The reactivities of human monoclonal antibodies thus generated were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining. Combining in vitro immunization with lymphocytes of cancer patients may lead to the successful production of clinically useful human monoclonal antibodies. 
4	Left ventricular regional wall stress in dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventriculography with simultaneous pressure micromanometry was performed in 11 normal control subjects and 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Left ventricular silhouettes in the right anterior oblique projection were divided into eight areas, and regional wall stress was computed by Janz's method in each area excluding the two most basal areas. Wall stress was higher in DCM patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.01). The percent area changes from end diastole to end systole in each area were lower in DCM patients than in control subjects (mean for six areas, 22 +/- 14% versus 54 +/- 9%, respectively, p less than 0.01), but the coefficient of variation for the percent area changes in the six areas of the left ventricle in DCM patients was greater than that in control subjects (32 +/- 17% versus 15 +/- 4%, respectively, p less than 0.01), indicating regional differences in hypokinesis. There was a significant negative correlation between end-systolic regional wall stress and percent area change (r = -0.60 to -0.86, p less than 0.05) in each area. Thus, excessive regional afterload may play an important role in causing regional hypokinesis in DCM. 
4	Spontaneous changes in ventricular tachycardia cycle length. Understanding spontaneous fluctuations in ventricular tachycardia cycle length is required to develop algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination. Variations in cycle length, time to stable cycle length and the range of RR intervals during ventricular tachycardia were analyzed in 74 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in patients not taking antiarrhythmic medication. Linear regression demonstrated cycle length variability to decrease over time (41 +/- 24 to 17 +/- 19 ms, p less than 0.001). Slower ventricular tachycardia had more cycle length variability than faster ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Ventricular tachycardia that was initially more variable tended to remain more variable (p less than 0.001). Fifty-four percent of episodes stabilized within the first 15 beats, 75% by 30 beats and 93% by 50 beats. The number of beats to stable cycle length was independent of ventricular tachycardia rate. The average range in cycle length per episode was 127 +/- 72 ms; 12% of ventricular tachycardia episodes varied by less than 50 ms and 45% by less than 150 ms. The maximal range in RR intervals from a single episode of ventricular tachycardia was 290 ms. Therefore, ventricular tachycardia demonstrates a wide range of cycle lengths and has time-dependent changes in variability and stability. These cycle length changes should be considered in the algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination by automatic antitachycardia devices. 
4	Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms. 
4	Percutaneous angioscopy during coronary angioplasty using a steerable microangioscope. The feasibility of using a flexible, steerable angioscope to perform coronary angioscopy before and after percutaneous coronary angioplasty was tested. The microangioscope fits through an 8F coronary angioplasty guiding catheter and contains a multifiber viewing bundle incorporated into the body of a 4.3F balloon catheter with a central lumen for distal flushing and guide-wire passage. Angioscopy was performed without complications 45 times in 24 patients, including 6 patients with stable and 18 with unstable angina. Circumferential visualization of the target lesion was successful in 20 (83%) of the 24 patients and improved with operator experience. Excellent visualization of the target lesion was achieved in 16 (94%) of the last 17 patients. Plaque, thrombus and dissection were among the abnormal findings in the 20 patients (4 with stable, 16 with unstable angina) in whom circumferential viewing of the target lesion was achieved. In four patients with restenosis after angioplasty, the lesion morphology was distinctly different from that of lesions in arteries without prior angioplasty. In patients with stable angina, no thrombus or dissection was seen by angiography or angioscopy before angioplasty. In patients with unstable angina, thrombus was detected more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (8 versus 2 of 16) and after (15 versus 2 of 16) angioplasty. Intimal dissection was also seen much more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (7 versus 0 of 16) and after angioplasty (16 versus 7 of 16). It is concluded that high resolution percutaneous coronary angioscopy can be performed safely in conjunction with balloon angioplasty. Further investigation is needed before this diagnostic tool can be applied clinically. 
4	Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
5	The relationship of headache symptoms with severity and duration of attacks. Efforts to develop clinically useful headache classification schemes have generally focused on linking specific symptom groupings with specific headache subtypes. An alternative conceptual approach, the "severity model" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache. 
3	Outpatient management of schizophrenia. As effective antipsychotic pharmacotherapy has become available, patients with schizophrenia are increasingly managed in an outpatient setting by primary care physicians. Pharmacotherapy is generally effective in treating "positive," or psychotic, symptoms and lessening the risks of relapse, but ineffective in improving "negative," or deficit, symptoms. Aggressive attempts to totally control positive symptoms and to ameliorate negative symptoms tend to increase side effects and may be detrimental to the patient. Intensive psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are generally unproductive. Attempting to obtain a cure is unrealistic. A moderate approach is recommended, taking into consideration the limitations of existing treatments, achieving control of extreme symptoms and minimizing social and occupational limitations. 
4	Transaortic endarterectomy of renal visceral artery lesions in association with infrarenal aortic surgery. The complexity of infrarenal aortic reconstruction increases when bypass grafts to revascularize associated renal and visceral arteries are needed. Lesions in these vessels, however, are usually limited to their aortic orifices and therefore are amenable to retroperitoneal transaortic endarterectomy. A combined infrarenal aortic reconstruction and transaortic endarterectomy of the renal/visceral vessels was used in 18 (16%) of 120 patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2-year-period. Transaortic endarterectomy was performed primarily for renal preservation in 11 patients with bilateral, high-grade renal artery stenoses and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.9 mg/dl). In seven patients transaortic endarterectomy was performed as a secondary procedure during the course of complex reconstruction of aneurysmal or occlusive aortic disease. Mean serum creatinine, which was elevated preoperatively in 14 (78%) patients (3.3 mg/dl), decreased significantly after the operation (2.0 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). A single death occurred in the 18 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy. Renal function preservation can be achieved by renal revascularization in patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses and decreased renal function. The retroperitoneal approach to aortic reconstruction and the use of transaortic endarterectomy allows correction of most renal/visceral vessel involvement in complex aortic revascularization procedures. 
1	Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. 
4	The effects of epidural anesthesia on the Doppler velocimetry of umbilical and uterine arteries in normal and hypertensive patients during active term labor. To study the effects of epidural anesthesia on uterine and umbilical artery blood flow in preeclampsia, we observed 25 patients in active labor at 36 or more weeks' gestation. Seven had preeclampsia, eight had chronic hypertension, and ten had no complications. Doppler velocimetry of the uterine and umbilical arteries was performed before and after intravenous fluid loading and at 30 and 60 minutes after epidural blockade. Maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate were monitored continuously. After epidural block, mean maternal blood pressure fell significantly in all groups, but no maternal hypotension was observed. Mean maternal and fetal heart rates were unchanged. After epidural block, mean uterine artery systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratios did not change in the chronic-hypertension and normal groups, but fell significantly in the preeclamptic group to values similar to those of the normal group. Umbilical artery S-D ratios did not change in any group. In preeclamptic pregnancy, epidural anesthesia may help to reduce uterine artery vasospasm and may benefit intrapartum fetal well-being. 
5	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an intermediate in IL-1-induced proliferation of leukemic human megakaryoblasts. We have examined the in vitro effects of recombinant human (rh) interleukin-1 (IL-1) on the growth of purified megakaryoblasts obtained from patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We demonstrate that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta treatment of these cells led to stimulation of DNA synthesis (as shown by increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation up to 35-fold) and also resulted in colony formation of leukemic megakaryoblasts. However, the stimulatory effect of IL-1 was dependent on endogenous production of IL-6, because addition of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to IL-6 abrogated the stimulatory activity of IL-1. In contrast, neutralizing MoAbs to granulocyte (G)-colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and macrophage (M)-CSF failed to counteract the growth-enhancing effects of IL-1. Leukemic megakaryoblasts accumulated IL-6 mRNA and released IL-6 protein into their culture supernatant when exposed to rh IL-1 but failed to disclose transcripts for G-, GM-, and M-CSF under these conditions. Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transcript levels demonstrated that megakaryoblasts constitutively expressed IL-6R mRNA and that these transcripts are down-regulated to undetectable levels upon exposure to IL-1 and IL-6. Increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation by megakaryoblasts could be duplicated by exogenous IL-6 that could be blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6. In conclusion, our results suggest that leukemic megakaryoblasts could produce and secrete IL-6, and express IL-6R, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on these cells is indirect, via production of IL-6 by leukemic cells. 
4	Mechanisms of reoxygenation injury in cultured ventricular myocytes To investigate factors contributing to reperfusion and reoxygenation myocardial injury, we exposed layers of cultured chick ventricular myocytes to severe hypoxia for up to 3 hours in the presence of 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose, zero glucose, and 5 mM pyruvate, and then exposed the myocytes to reoxygenation. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was moderately increased during 3 hours of hypoxia but was increased markedly during reoxygenation. Coincident changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cell motion were also measured during hypoxia and reoxygenation. During hypoxia, [Ca2+]i increased to more than 1 microM, and with reoxygenation, [Ca2+]i abruptly decreased slightly but remained elevated more than 1 microM. Cells developed a stable rigor after 30 minutes of hypoxia. Reoxygenation caused a marked hypercontracture within 5 minutes. Pretreatment of myocytes with either 2,3-butanedione monoxime, which inhibits Ca2(+)-dependent force development, or cyanide inhibited reoxygenation hypercontracture. LDH release after reoxygenation was also significantly reduced in the presence of 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Treatment of myocytes with superoxide dismutase and catalase during hypoxia also resulted in a decrease in LDH release during reoxygenation. We conclude that an abrupt increase in [Ca2+]i during reoxygenation does not account for reoxygenation injury. However, in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, reoxygenation and the resulting probable resynthesis of ATP causes [Ca2+]i-dependent myofilament crossbridge cycling, and the resulting hypercontracture contributes to myocyte damage. The generation of oxygen free radicals after reoxygenation also appears to contribute to cell injury in this system. 
5	Bilateral vocal cord hematomas associated with shoulder harness use. A case of bilateral vocal cord hematomas caused by a shoulder harness injury is presented. The patient was restrained by a three-point belt system and was involved in a front-end collision. She presented with mild facial and chest injuries and a contusion of the neck. One hour after injury she began to complain of hoarseness without airway compromise. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed bilateral true vocal cord hematomas. The patient had an uneventful hospital course and a full recovery. The importance of the mechanism of injury and associated injuries is discussed. 
1	Spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer. Fifty-five patients with severe pain from spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer were referred to Hope Hospital, none being judged to be in a terminal condition. One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated. 
2	Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. 
1	Radiation therapy of early (stages I and II-A) seminoma of testis after initial orchiectomy. With initial orchiectomy and radiation therapy, the prognosis of the patients with early (Stages I and II-A) testicular seminoma is nearing almost 100 percent. Thirty-two patients with Stage I and 13 patients with Stage II-A seminoma of the testis were treated with initial orchiectomy. This was followed by estimation biochemical markers and radiologic investigations. All the patients with Stage I disease received radiotherapy to the ipsilateral pelvic and para-aortic nodes. The patients with Stage II-A disease also received radiation therapy to the supradiaphragmatic regions. The disease-free survival in both groups of patients was found to be 100 percent. 
3	Beneficial effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema following brain embolization in rats. We assessed the effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema after inducing multifocal brain infarcts in 108 rats by the intracarotid injection of 50-microns carbonized microspheres. An ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis, 25 mmol/kg i.p. butanediol was injected every 3 hours to produce a sustained increase in the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Treatment significantly attenuated ischemia-induced metabolic changes by increasing the concentrations of phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and glycogen and by reducing the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate. Lactate concentration 2, 6, and 12 hours after embolization decreased by 13%, 44%, and 46%, respectively. Brain water content increased from 78.63% in six unembolized rats to 80.93% in 12 saline-treated and 79.57% in seven butanediol-treated rats 12 hours after embolization. (p less than 0.05). The decrease in water content was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium and chloride. The antiedema effect of butanediol could not be explained by an osmotic mechanism since equimolar doses of urea or ethanol were ineffective. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of butanediol is mediated through cerebral utilization of ketone bodies arising from butanediol metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis and the deleterious accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia. 
3	Barrett's esophagus in children and young adults. Frequent association with mental retardation. Since few data are available on epidemiologic features of Barrett's esophagus in young persons, we reviewed the case records of patients undergoing esophageal biopsies at Children's Hospital, Boston, from 1982 through 1986. There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of esophagitis was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of esophagitis cases). Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients. The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of all cases. The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985. Mental retardation, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's esophagitis, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002). The frequency of mental retardation was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for esophagitis (19%) than in those with normal biopsies (14%). No significant differences were found between the Barrett's group and all patients biopsied in regards to racial origin, prior stricture, or fundoplication. 
1	High- versus standard-dose megestrol acetate in women with advanced breast cancer: a phase III trial of the Piedmont Oncology Association. One hundred seventy-two patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive oral standard-dose megestrol acetate (MA), 160 mg/d or high-dose MA, 800 mg/d. All but two patients had one prior trial of tamoxifen therapy for either metastatic disease (74%) or as adjuvant treatment (26%). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both arms. High-dose MA resulted in a superior complete plus partial response rate (27% v 10%, P = .005), time to treatment failure (median, 8.0 v 3.2 months, P = .019), and survival (median, 22.4 v 16.5 months, P = .04) when compared with standard-dose therapy. These differences remained significant after adjustment for other covariates. Thirty-four patients were given high-dose MA after failure of standard-dose MA treatment, and none responded. Weight gain was the most distressing side effect, with 13% of standard-dose and 43% of high-dose patients gaining more than 20 lbs. Four major cardiovascular events occurred in patients receiving high-dose treatment and one in patients given standard doses. Other toxicity was modest. High-dose MA may represent a significant improvement in secondary endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer patients refractory to initial endocrine treatment, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until these results are confirmed by other clinical trials. 
1	Flow cytometric DNA index in the prognosis of colorectal cancer. The authors investigated the relationship between flow cytometric DNA index (DI, defined as the ratio of the DNA content of malignant cells to that of normal cells) and other prognostic factors (grade and stage, anatomical site, age and sex) with the survival of 115 patients with colorectal cancer. Multiple biopsy specimens from 62 patients were taken during colonoscopy before surgery. Additional samples from 53 patients were obtained from paraffin-embedded material. All patients were treated with surgery only. Fresh-frozen material gave higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy than paraffin-embedded material (79% versus 41%). The patients with DNA diploid tumors (DI = 1) had a better overall survival than those with DNA aneuploid tumors (DI = 1). Among DNA aneuploid tumors, those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2) were worse than those with DI = 1.2 (excluding DI = 1) and DI = 2. Cox's regression analysis showed that pathologic stage was more important for prognosis than DNA index, whereas age, sex, histologic grade, and anatomic site were removed from the analysis as not relevant for prognosis. Relative risk of death (RR), in reference to patients with DI = 1 and Stages A + B (RR = 1), were RR = 1.8 for patients with carcinomas with Stage C. RR = 2.7 for patients with carcinomas with DNA near-diploid and DNA tetraploid tumors. RR = 3.5 for those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2), and RR = 8.0 for those with Stage D. These data indicate that flow cytometrically evaluated DI values have a relevant independent power for predicting the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients. 
1	The expression of progesterone receptors coincides with an arrest of DNA synthesis in human breast cancer. Two main models to account for the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in human breast cancer have been proposed: the clonal model and the stem cell model. The authors previously provided evidence supporting the stem cell model since it was found that most of the proliferating cells in ER-positive (ER+) human breast cancer lack ER and that the ER-negative (ER-) and ER+ subpopulations are interrelated. The authors have analyzed in eighteen ER+/PR+ primary breast tumors the simultaneous expression of ER or PR (by immunohistochemistry) and DNA synthesis (by autoradiography) after 30 minutes of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The authors demonstrated that: (1) the average numbers of ER+ and PR+ cells were similar (36.8 +/- 10.7% and 39.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively); (2) The thymidine-labeling indexes of the ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- subpopulations were 0.53 +/- 0.69%, 0.74 +/- 0.49%, 0.21 +/- 0.21 and 0.94 +/- 0.54%, respectively; and (3) 75.2% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-, and 88.8% of them were PR-. The authors conclude that the cellular subpopulations expressing ER and PR were not identical, and the expression of PR was associated with a lower rate of cellular proliferation than was ER expression. 
4	Coronary flow and mental stress. Experimental findings. The hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and coronary flow responses to a psychological test were studied in 13 pigs both in the absence (group 1, n = 8) and the presence (group 2, n = 5) of a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion. 
3	Multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. The data from a prospective study of 508 spine injuries were reviewed to determine the incidence of multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. All patients were examined at admission and at 1 and 2 years postinjury. This series identified 77 (15.2%) multilevel fractures. Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of these fractures. The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures. Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries. Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries. The prognosis for multilevel spine fractures was not significantly worse that that for single-level injuries. 
5	Laryngeal dystonia: a series with botulinum toxin therapy. Laryngeal dystonia is a syndrome characterized by action-induced, involuntary spasms of the laryngeal muscles. Most patients have involvement of the adductor laryngeal muscles producing uncontrolled spasms during phonation, and a "strain-strangle" speech pattern commonly termed "spastic dysphonia." Other patients have involvement of the abductor muscles producing "whispering dysphonia." Rare patients have paradoxical vocal cord motion during respiration with adductor spasms on inspiration. Over the past 5 years we have used botulinum toxin (BOTOX) to treat more than 200 patients with laryngeal dystonia. This group includes patients with adductor involvement (phonatory dystonia, recurrent laryngeal nerve section failure, respiratory dystonia) and those with abductor involvement (whispering dystonia). Patients received benefit within 24 to 72 hours, with sustained improvement for 2 to 9 months with an average of 4 months. Patients improved to an average of 90% of normal function. Clinically significant adverse effects included extended breathy dysphonia and mild choking on fluids. BOTOX has become our treatment of choice for dystonic conditions of the larynx. 
4	Surgical repair of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome complicated with myocardial bridging. Myocardial bridging causes myocardial ischemia during supraventricular tachycardia. We present a case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome combined with myocardial bridging. The patient complained of angina pectoris during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia because of severe constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery during systole. A myocardial scintigram revealed myocardial ischemia in the anteroseptal wall during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Myotomy to prevent myocardial bridging and interruption of the accessory conduction pathway was successfully accomplished in a one-stage operation. 
5	Long-term results of submandibular duct transposition for drooling. This study examines the long-term results and morbidity of submandibular duct transposition in drooling children. Twenty-two patients, aged 3 to 18 years, with neurological dysfunction and excessive drooling underwent submandibular duct transposition between 1984 and 1987. In January 1990, 20 patients were reviewed. Their degree of drooling pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and currently was assessed. The rate of improvement and the occurrence of complications were noted. Drooling was 'much better' in the early post-operative period in 17 of the 20 patients, and this improvement was invariably noted within three weeks. In the three other patients drooling was 'better'. Deterioration occurred in only three patients over the entire follow-up period. Complications all occurred in the first 18 months following surgery; they consisted of salivary retention cysts in four and transient submandibular gland swelling in a fifth patient. 
5	Hepatocyte expression of HBcAg and serum HBeAg in hepatitis B: comparison of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies during a trial of interferon. The distribution and quantitative expression of HBcAg in relation to serum HBeAg and liver histology before and after a trial of interferon in 50 patients with chronic type B hepatitis were evaluated using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In general, both antisera showed a similar pattern in terms of the distribution of HBcAg, with predominant localisation of HBcAg in the cytoplasm in HBeAg positive patients with chronic active hepatitis. Semiquantitative analysis showed, however, that there was a higher degree of cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg with polyclonal than with monoclonal anti-HBc. Some of the HBeAg positive patients with only a focal expression of HBcAg in the cytoplasm by polyclonal anti-HBc showed no expression of HBcAg with monoclonal anti-HBc. The expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis or the persistence of serum HBeAg on follow up, suggesting that it did not result from non-specific or false positive staining. All of the HBeAg negative patients with minimal histological changes or inactive cirrhosis were HBcAg negative with both antisera. In conclusion, though both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced a quite similar distribution of HBcAg in patients with chronic type B hepatitis, polyclonal antibody seemed to be more sensitive in detecting HBcAg in the cytoplasm than did monoclonal anti-HBc, and the expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the clinical and histological outcome. 
1	Measurement techniques for melanoma: a statistical comparison Inter- and intra-observer variation in measuring the depth of invasion of malignant melanomas was assessed using three different techniques: eye-piece graticule, stage Vernier, and projection image analysis. Significant variation was found for all methods but was least pronounced with the stage Vernier. It is recommended that this should be the preferred technique for routine use. 
5	One hundred percent oxygen reverses muscle hypoxia in a rat hindlimb model of acute arterial occlusion. Significant morbidity results from extremity ischemia after acute arterial occlusion. Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension. 
5	Influence of hepatitis delta virus replication in the presence of hepatitis B virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of hepatitis B virus DNA was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 259 HBsAg carriers (229 anti-hepatitis delta negative, 30 anti-hepatitis delta positive), 16 anti-HBc-positive HBsAg-negative patients and 30 patients without hepatitis B virus markers. Hepatitis B virus DNA sequences were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 115 (44.4%) of the chronic HBsAg carriers and from two (12%) of the anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. In anti-hepatitis delta-negative patients, viral DNA was positive in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 74 (46%) and from 24 (35.5%) with and without serum HBV-DNA, respectively. With respect to anti-hepatitis delta-positive patients, viral DNA was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in 8 of 13 (61.5%) of the patients with circulating hepatitis delta virus RNA and in 9 of 17 (53%) of the hepatitis delta virus RNA-negative subjects. Regarding hepatitis B virus DNA in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell, 71% (5 of 7) of the patients with serum hepatitis B virus DNA had this marker in peripheral blood mononuclear cell, whereas 52% (12 of 23) of the patients without serum hepatitis B virus DNA had hepatitis B virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell. A Southern blot analysis was also carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 30 patients. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 16 patients as free forms, in 12 patients as dimers and free forms and as free circular together with free linear forms in the remaining two patients. 
1	Altered expression of the retinoblastoma gene product in human sarcomas. BACKGROUND. The retinoblastoma-susceptibility (Rb) gene is a prototype tumor-suppressor gene originally isolated from patients with heritable retinoblastoma. This gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression is altered in several types of human tumors. METHODS. We studied the expression of the Rb protein in 44 primary and 12 metastatic high-grade human sarcomas by means of immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting. Computerized image analysis was used to quantify the level of Rb gene product in individual tumor cells. The expression of the Rb gene was then correlated with clinical outcome in the patients with primary tumors. RESULTS. Of the 44 patients with primary sarcomas, 13 (30 percent) had tumors with normal, homogeneous expression of the Rb protein in essentially all tumor cells. Thirty-one patients with primary tumors (70 percent) had altered Rb expression; in 18 (40 percent) the Rb protein was heterogeneously expressed, and in 13 (30 percent) it was detected in fewer than 20 percent of the tumor cells. All 12 of the patients with metastatic sarcomas had altered expression of the Rb protein. When the findings in the patients with primary tumors were correlated with clinical outcome, survival was found to be significantly increased in the patients whose tumors had homogeneous Rb expression, as compared with those with either heterogeneous expression (P = 0.026) or no expression (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS. Tumors in which the expression of Rb gene product was decreased were more aggressive than tumors in which this protein was expressed by nearly all cells. The Rb gene product may be an important prognostic variable in patients with these tumors. 
3	Functional outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation. I examine statistical considerations in the analysis of functional outcome following stroke and discuss the mathematical relation between improvement in function and discharge functional score. I demonstrate mathematically that the predictor variables of improvement and discharge functional score are the same and that the regression coefficients for improvement and discharge functional score will be equal, except for the admission functional score, for which a mathematically defined relation exists. I argue that the relation between admission functional score and discharge functional score must be positive and strong and that the relation between admission functional score and improvement must be negative for the stroke population. I believe that an ignorance of statistical concepts, especially confounding, and of the differences between raw correlations, partial correlations, and predictors have led to much confusion in functional outcome research. 
4	Hemodynamic determinants of subdiaphragmatic venous return during closed-chest CPR in a canine cardiac arrest model. OBJECTIVE: To assess the hemodynamic determinates of peripheral subdiaphragmatic venous-to-right-heart return during closed-chest CPR. MODEL: Seven anesthetized dogs subjected to electrically induced ventricular fibrillation for five minutes. INTERVENTIONS: Conventional closed-chest CPR and closed-chest CPR with continuous abdominal binding at a chest compression rate of 60 per minute, a compression-to-relaxation ratio of 50:50, and a ventilation-to-compression ratio of 1:5. METHODS: Solid-state catheters were positioned in the ascending aorta, right atrium (RA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). Cannulating electromagnetic flow probes were inserted into the IVC and a carotid artery. Analog-to-digital conversion was performed electronically. Five minutes after ventricular fibrillation was induced, interventions were performed in an alternating sequence. Systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures and flows were measured and compared. STATISTICAL METHODS: Two-tailed, unpaired t test applied to equal sample size, linear regression analysis, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Abdominal binding during CPR significantly increased (P less than .05) all measured systolic and diastolic CPR intravascular pressures compared with CPR without abdominal binding but did not affect IVC-to-right-heart venous return. During conventional CPR without abdominal binding, venous return was dependent on the diastolic IVC pressure (r = .86, P = .014), mean IVC pressure (r = .80, P = .03), and carotid blood flow (r = .99, P = .001) but not on the IVC-to-RA pressure gradient. With abdominal binding, venous return was not correlated with any study hemodynamic variable, including the peripheral venous-to-RA pressure gradient. CONCLUSION: Venous return from the subdiaphragmatic venous bed during CPR is dependent on venous pressure, not on the peripheral venous-to-right-heart pressure gradient. Abdominal binding during CPR does not affect venous return. Venous return during CPR diastole is highly dependent on central venous capacitance (left heart outflow during CPR systole). 
1	Bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas. Report of a case with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses. A case study of bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses is presented. Analysis of tumor cell nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry revealed aneuploid cell populations in both tumors. Standard cytogenetic analysis (Giemsa-banding technique used) of the right carotid body paraganglioma showed no evidence of numerical or structural abnormalities. We describe parameters currently used to "predict" biological behavior in these tumors. 
3	Visuospatial impairment in Parkinson's disease. We explored the nature of the visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its progression as a function of disease duration. We compared the performance of 183 patients with idiopathic PD and 90 control subjects matched for age and education on six visuospatial measures. We divided patients into three groups according to the disease duration: early (1 to 4 years), middle (5 to 10 years), and advanced (greater than 10 years). Performance deteriorated in five of the six visuospatial measures, as a function of disease duration. However, the pattern of visuospatial decline depended on whether dementia was present. The results were not influenced by age or anticholinergic medication. These findings support the presence of visuospatial deficits in PD patients, with a changing pattern of impairment related to dementia and progression of the disease. 
5	Recurrent urethral stricture disease managed by clean intermittent self-catheterization. We studied 41 patients with urethral stricture who had failed at least 1 operation, and were being maintained with filiform and follower dilation every 6 to 12 weeks. The patients were instructed in clean intermittent self-catheterization with a 16F red rubber catheter, which was performed every 1 to 30 days. Followup from 9 to 36 months revealed excellent compliance and average peak uroflow rates increased from 5.5 cc per second before dilation to 17.1 cc per second at the last followup visit. Clean intermittent self-catheterization is a simple method to maintain a patent urethra and obviates the need for further operations or painful dilations. 
3	Long-term follow-up review of 31 children with severe closed head trauma. Thirty-one children aged 3 to 15 years were followed for 5 to 11 years after suffering severe closed head trauma which caused coma for 1 week or more (median duration of coma 3 weeks). One patient remained in a persistent vegetative state until his death 9 years later. The other 30 recovered consciousness and were discharged. All suffered diminution of their abilities, and 24 of them had major permanent disability. The most common motor disabilities were pure spastic hemiparesis (seven cases), basal ganglia syndromes (four cases), ataxia (three cases), and a combination of hemiparesis and ataxia (five cases). Of the 30 patients, 26 regained independent ambulation, seven were epileptic, and 14 were dysarthric in various degrees. Only 10 had the cognitive ability to profit from the normal educational system, and none had attempted postsecondary education. Social problems were common. The worst outcomes were associated with intracranial bleeding and/or brain contusion seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans at the acute stage; the best were associated with normal CT scans. The degree of residual disability in these children seems no less than that of adults with trauma of similar severity. 
4	Plaque and structural characteristics of the descending thoracic aorta using transesophageal echocardiography. The in vivo acoustic and structural characteristics of atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta have not been well delineated. We prospectively evaluated the descending thoracic aorta of 147 patients (35 women and 112 men; age, 61 +/- 14 years) who underwent clinically indicated transesophageal echocardiography. Patients with suspected disease of the aorta were excluded. Thirty-eight patients (26%) had protruding plaques (men, 25%; women, 29%). Six patients had mobile intimal densities with the mobile area ranging up to 1 cm2. As expected, aortic lumen area was decreased (plaque-free, 3.53 cm2; plaque, 3.19 cm2; p less than 0.05) and wall area was increased (plaque-free, 1.51 cm2; plaque, 1.92 cm2; p less than 0.05) in the regions of the plaque. However, total arterial area was not increased (plaque-free, 5.04 cm2; plaque, 5.09 cm2; difference not significant) in a compensatory manner as observed in other arterial beds. Plaque gray scale was less than the gray scale of plaque-free wall (plaque-free, 141.2; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05) when compared at the same level of the descending thoracic aorta or with a second aortic plaque-free level (plaque-free, 150.4; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05). Standard deviation of gray scale level was similar between plaque and normal regions. Unsuspected protruding plaques in the descending thoracic aorta occurred in one quarter of the patients referred for routine transesophageal examination. Plaques tended to have lower echogenicity and were differentiated from plaque-free walls within patients. Plaque formation did not result in increased total arterial area. These data suggest that the degree or character of compensatory atherosclerotic remodeling in the highly elastic descending thoracic aorta may differ from other arterial beds. 
1	The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease. 
1	Autologous antibodies eluted from membrane fragments in human ovarian epithelial neoplastic effusions. III. Cytotoxic potential in vitro and characterization of antigen(s). Cyst and ascites fluids from patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms contain immunoglobulins with antitumor activity. Autologous antibodies bound to the cellular membrane fragments obtained from human ovarian neoplastic effusions react with cell-surface antigens on different human ovarian cell lines, surgical specimens of human ovarian adenocarcinoma, and human ovarian tumors grown in athymic Balb/c mice. The antibodies do not react with tissue preparations from normal human ovaries, other nonovarian normal or neoplastic tissues, and nonovarian human cell lines. These studies indicate that these antibodies are capable of complement-mediated lysis of human ovarian tumor cell lines in vitro. Preliminary characterization of the autologous ovarian tumor-associated antigen(s) indicates that it may be composed of three large-molecular-weight proteins of 182,000, 164,000, and 122,000 d. 
5	Postoperative ectopic craniopharyngioma. Case report. The case of an ectopic craniopharyngioma arising from a seed of tissue deposited along the operative track is reported. The uniqueness of this lesion is addressed. Ideal therapy and controversies regarding radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas are discussed in light of this new variation in recurrence. 
1	Immunophenotyping in the management of gastric lymphoma. Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare tumor in which surgical resection plays a major role in improving the response rate and reducing the incidence of bleeding and perforation after chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was made by immunophenotyping snap-frozen endoscopic biopsy specimens. All neoplasms were B-cell lymphomas. Pan B surface marker antigens were present in all patients. Levels of Ki-67, a nuclear marker of tumor proliferation, were greater than 45% in two of the four patients who died after progression of their lymphoma. All patients alive had Ki-67 levels of less than 30%. A lower proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, appears to be associated with better prognosis. Ten of 11 patients treated by resection prior to chemotherapy had no complications. Immunophenotyping is the key in the differential diagnosis when considering malignant lymphoma with gastric carcinoma and benign conditions such as pseudolymphoma. 
4	Ultrasonographic diagnosis of a large placental intervillous thrombosis associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. A placental lesion associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level and a positive Kleihauer-Betke test is reported. Serial ultrasonograms showed a progressive increase in the echogenicity of the lesion that corresponded to a large intervillous thrombosis after delivery. This case illustrates the importance of detailed ultrasonographic and pathologic placental investigations in pregnancies with unexplained elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. 
1	Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. 
1	Expression of beta 1 integrins in normal human keratinocytes. The majority of cell adhesive events to the extracellular matrix are mediated by cell surface receptors, beta 1 integrins. Keratinocytes express at least six different polypeptides of beta 1 integrin class, namely beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 (alpha 6 is mainly associated with beta 4 polypeptide). These epithelial cells use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen receptor and alpha 3 beta 1 as a fibronectin receptor, while alpha 6 beta 4 is the major basement membrane receptor. Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 complex is low. Processing of beta 1 integrins is fast in keratinocytes; half-maximal maturation takes only 3 hours. In addition to their function in cell-matrix interactions, beta 1 integrins (alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1) have also a role in maintaining keratinocyte cell-cell interactions. It is possible that resting basal keratinocytes use beta 1 integrins as cell-cell adhesion receptors, and during activation, like in wound healing, these receptors relocalize to mediate events involving cell-matrix interactions. 
3	Long-term efficacy of primary laser trabeculoplasty. Sixty glaucomatous eyes of 60 patients treated with laser trabeculoplasty as primary therapy were reviewed retrospectively. There were 42 eyes with capsular glaucoma and 18 with simple glaucoma. The mean prelaser intraocular pressure (IOP) was 35.2 (SD = 6.5) mmHg. Success was defined as IOP less than or equal to 22 mmHg without medication. The probability of success was 0.73 at 1 year, 0.66 at 2 years, 0.57 at 3 years, and 0.50 at 4 years. Three eyes experienced progressive visual field loss or disc damage in spite of an intraocular pressure below 22 mmHg without medication. High prelaser pressure and the severity of the visual field defects were significant predictors of treatment failure. 
5	Cluster of fulminant hepatitis B in crack users. Fulminant hepatitis occurs in only 1% of acute hepatitis B patients, requiring hospitalization, but coinfection with delta virus increases the incidence. Hepatitis B and D infection are commonly associated with intravenous drug abuse, but there have been no previous reports of an association with nonparenteral cocaine. Crack use, via sexual promiscuity, is associated with an increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, but has never been associated with viral hepatitis. We report four fatal cases of fulminant hepatitis B including, one with delta virus coinfection and one with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, in young, sexually active, heterosexual crack users. These patients denied a history of intravenous drug abuse. Our patients probably contracted hepatitis B infection via heterosexual contact. Chronic cocaine exposure may or may not have contributed to the fulminant outcome. Crack users may be at increased risk of developing hepatitis B and D infection. Epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate their risk of viral hepatitis and the effect of cocaine on its outcome. 
5	Oxygen uptake and heart rate responses during hypoxic exercise in children and adults. Control of ventilation and heart rate during exercise appears to undergo maturation, while aerobic metabolism (VO2) may not. Since we had previously found that hypoxia during exercise produced different ventilatory responses in children (C) compared to adults (A), we hypothesized that VO2 and heart rate kinetics during exercise would show similar maturational responses to hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses during progressive (ramp) and constant work rate tests in children and adults breathing either room air or hypoxic gas (FiO2 = 0.15). When corrected for body weight, children and adults had similar values for lactic acidosis threshold (LAT) (C: 29.1 +/- 5.0 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 27.9 +/- 4.3) and VO2max (C: 40.7 +/- 8.6 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 45.2 +/- 6.7) during normoxia. Hypoxia significantly lowered LAT (C: 27.5 +/- 5.4 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 23.2 +/- 3.8; both P less than 0.05) and VO2max (C: 37.7 +/- 8.3 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 40.1 +/- 5.3; both P less than 0.05) in both children and adults. Metabolic efficiency (delta VO2/delta work rate) and the VO2-heart rate relationship (delta VO2/delta HR/kg) were similar in the two groups and unaffected by hypoxia. During the constant work rate exercise, VO2 kinetics (time constant during phase 2 of the response (pi 1) and the O2 deficit) were similar between children and adults and were significantly slowed by hypoxia, consistent with current understanding of the control of oxidative metabolism. Finally, heart rate was increased at rest and during exercise with hypoxia, while the time to reach 75% of the end-exercise response was delayed significantly, in both groups. 
1	Cutaneous horn of the penis: its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection. Cutaneous horns of the penis are rare. Including this case, only 19 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. In 37% of the reported cases a malignant tumor was found beneath the cutaneous horn. Our case is remarkable because a stage I squamous cell carcinoma developed on the shaft of the penis of a neonatally circumcised man. Human genital carcinoma resulting from a multifactorial process in which "promoting" papillomavirus is an integral element is being increasingly reported. We review the relationship of circumcision to genital human papillomavirus infection and their synergism in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. 
4	Hypertension with concomitant conditions: the changing role of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Hypertension often is associated with concomitant conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Moreover, other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemias and abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism, are common in patients with hypertension. Conventional beta-blockers used for antihypertensive therapy can have adverse effects in patients with airway disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, and can exaggerate the other risk factors. Newer beta-blockers such as celiprolol, which have selective partial agonist activity expressed at beta 2-receptors, appear to avoid these problems. Celiprolol exhibits antianginal and antihypertensive efficacy without adversely effecting left ventricular systolic function or exercise performance. It also may cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The stimulatory action of celiprolol on vascular beta 2-receptors enhances regional flow and may increase walking distance in patients with claudication. The reduction in renal vascular resistance demonstrated by this drug is associated with preservation of renal blood flow and function. Spirometric measurements of airway function are unchanged during celiprolol treatment. Similarly, there are no adverse effects on lipid or glucose concentrations. These new developments in beta-blocker pharmacology indicate that this class of agents could be used in patients with hypertension with concomitant diseases or risk factors other than high blood pressure. 
2	Human T cell lymphotropic virus infection in Guaymi Indians from Panama. Preliminary studies found that 9% of Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro province have antibody to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II). The present study enrolled 317 (21% of the population) Guaymi Indians from Changuinola, the capital of Bocas del Toro province and 333 (70% of the population) from Canquintu, an isolated rural village. Demographic information and family relationships were ascertained and subjects were screened for neurologic diseases. Serum specimens were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-I/II antibody and positives were confirmed according to U.S. Public Health Service criteria. Twenty-five (8%) Guaymi residing in Changuinola and 7 (2.1%) from Canquintu were confirmed seropositive. In Changuinola, antibody was virtually limited to residents greater than or equal to 15 years of age (24 [16%] of 153) and rates were slightly higher in males than in females; in Canquintu, antibody rates did not increase significantly with age and appeared higher in females than in males. In Changuinola, there was no evidence for household clustering of infection. In contrast, HTLV antibody among Canquintu residents clustered significantly by household. HTLV-associated neurologic disease was not detected in either population. The atypical seroepidemiology observed in both locations might be explained if the virus endemic to the Guaymi differed from HTLV-I previously described in the Caribbean basin and Japan. 
2	Significance of anti-HBx antibodies in hepatitis B virus infection. Serological responses to hepatitis B virus-X determinants have been noted in human sera, but conflicting findings concerning the correlation of anti-HBx antibodies with different stages of hepatitis B virus infection or pathological sequelae have been reported. Using an adenovirus-based eukaryotic vector, the 17 kD X protein was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Cellular extracts containing the eukaryotic X protein have been used to screen for anti-HBx antibodies by immunoblot analysis in a large panel of sera from patients affected by hepatitis B virus chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute viral hepatitis. Sera from 32 of 171 (19%) chronic hepatitis B virus patients were positive for anti-HBx antibodies. Only one of thirty-two (3%) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive chronic hepatitis serum was anti-HBx positive. Very few sera from primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positivity for anti-HBx (8 of 149 or 5%). Anti-HBx were also detected in 8 of 48 (17%) acute viral hepatitis patients. In the four cases that were followed up weekly, anti-HBx antibodies appeared 3 to 4 wk after the onset of the clinical signs. To compare the X protein expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as a substrate for anti-HBx antibody detection, 171 sera were screened with HBx fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The prokaryotic cell extract test seems to be more sensitive. During the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection, the presence of anti-HBx antibodies detected with the eukaryotic cell extract correlates with the presence of well-established markers of ongoing viral replication: serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (p less than 0.001) and intrahepatic HBcAg expression (p less than 0.001). 
4	Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. After pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, performed for relief of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, perfusion lung scans have frequently disclosed new perfusion defects in segments served by undissected pulmonary arteries. Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients. The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery. Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects. The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular "steal.". 
2	Two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia. We report two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. After sudden onset of epigastralgia, acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia were found in both patients. There were no diseases that could explain the acute pancreatitis except for hypercalcemia probably due to adult T-cell leukemia. Thus we considered that hypercalcemia due to adult T-cell leukemia had led to acute pancreatitis. This is the first report of such a complication in adult T-cell leukemia. 
3	Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion. 
5	Role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for clinical stage B2 prostate cancer. To examine the role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer we reviewed the first 77 such patients in our series since we adopted the nerve-sparing technique. A total of 47 patients (61%) underwent bilateral and 26 (34%) underwent unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy, while in 4 (5%) both neurovascular bundles were resected. Among the patients followed for 12 months 27 of 41 (66%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 19 (37%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy had potency preserved. With the strict clinicopathological criteria of organ-confined tumor, that is intracapsular tumor with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels, complete tumor excision was achieved in 17 patients (36%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 26 (27%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy. All patients in whom both neurovascular bundles were resected had pathological stage C or D1 disease. Of the 24 patients who had complete tumor excision by the strict criteria only 15 (19.5% of the 77 preoperatively potent patients) had potency preserved. Of these patients 19 had microscopically positive margins without seminal vesicle invasion (pathological stage C1) with undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. In addition, 4 patients had seminal vesicle involvement with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. If these patients also are considered as having complete tumor excision, there was an over-all complete tumor excision rate of 61% (47 of 77), of whom 25 (32% of the 77 patients) had preservation of potency. Ten patients with clinical stage B2 tumor whose potency was preserved had histological and serological evidence of incomplete tumor excision. Of 53 patients with pathological stage C1 disease 9 (17%) had margins positive only in the regions of the neurovascular bundles. Preoperative prostate specific antigen and acid phosphatase levels, and findings on transrectal ultrasonography failed to predict accurately which patients had extracapsular tumor extension. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors and/or bulky disease on rectal examination had a higher incidence of extracapsular extension and positive margins. We conclude that in the majority of potent patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer not all of the goals of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy are realized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Macrophages stimulate bone resorption when they phagocytose particles. We investigated in vitro a mechanism by which particulate debris may induce bone resorption and cause implant loosening. We first studied two standard particles: latex, which is considered to be inert, and zymosan, which is inflammatory. Macrophages that phagocytosed either particle became activated, and stimulated 15 times as much bone resorption as did control macrophages. For activation to occur, 100 times more latex than zymosan had to be phagocytosed. We also found that bone cement and polyethylene particles activated macrophages in a similar manner, and that the necessary amounts of these were intermediate between those of latex and zymosan. None of the particles were toxic. It was concluded that implant loosening may result from bone resorption stimulated by mediators released by macrophages that have phagocytosed particles of bone cement or polyethylene. 
4	Exercise echocardiography and technetium-99m MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography in the detection of coronary artery disease. To compare the relative diagnostic value of exercise echocardiography with perfusion technetium-99m metoxyisobutylisonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), 75 patients with suspected CAD but a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest were included in a prospective correlative study. Both the exercise echocardiograms and SPECT studies were performed in conjunction with the same symptom-limited bicycle exercise test. The development of either a new wall motion abnormality or a reversible perfusion defect after exercise, or both, were regarded as a positive test for the exercise echocardiographic and SPECT studies, respectively. The results of these 2 diagnostic tests were compared with coronary arteriography. Exercise echocardiography identified 35 (71%) and SPECT 41 (84%, p = 0.13) of the 49 patients with significant CAD (defined as greater than 50% diameter stenosis). Twenty-five of the 26 patients (96%) without significant coronary stenosis had negative exercise echocardiographic results and 23 of 26 (88%) had negative SPECT results. Exercise-induced new wall motion abnormalities showed a good correlation with reversible perfusion defects, and the results of the 2 methods were concordant in 65 of 75 patients (agreement = 88%, kappa = 0.75 +/- 0.14). Both the diagnostic accuracy of exercise echocardiography and SPECT were significantly higher than the exercise ECG (81 vs 64%, p less than 0.02 and 88 vs 64%, p less than 0.005). The sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual diseased vessels were 60 and 95% for exercise echocardiography and 67 and 94% for SPECT. 
2	Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. 
5	Acute hypervolaemia increases gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of liquid in the rat. The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess. 
5	Final height in boys with untreated constitutional delay in growth and puberty. To determine the natural history and psychological impact of the growth pattern in boys with constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP), 43 boys presenting with short stature due to CDGP were followed up to final height. At presentation mean (SD) chronological age was 14.0 (1.9) years, bone age delay 2.7 (1.0) years, standing height standard deviation score (SDS) -3.4 (0.6), and predicted adult height SDS -1.3 (0.7). Final adult height SDS was -1.6 (0.9), measured at 21.2 (2.6) years. There was no significant difference between final height and predicted adult height, but there was a significant difference between final height and measured mid-parental height. Psychological questionnaires showed no significant difference in self esteem, marital, or employment state between the CDGP group and a control group. There was no correlation between self esteem and final height, but 25 felt their growth delay had affected their success either at school, work, or socially and 20 would rather have had treatment to advance their growth spurt. This study supports the more frequent use of active medical treatment to advance growth in boys with CDGP, and shows that although boys with CDGP reach their predicted heights, this is short for their families. 
3	Paraesthesia with lumbar epidural catheters. A comparison of air and saline in a loss-of-resistance technique. The epidural space was located in 32 obstetric patients using loss of resistance to air, while in a further 35 saline was used. The incidence of paraesthesia was 56% in the air group and 57% in the saline group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of other complications or in the quality of analgesia provided. 
3	Effects of MK-801 on recovery from sensorimotor cortex lesions. Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons. In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex. In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery. Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6. Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing. After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb. Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing. In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery. Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits. The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection. These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage. 
4	Spinal extradural cavernous hemangioma. Three cases of isolated spinal extradural cavernous hemangiomas are reported, two in the thoracic and one in the lumbar region. One of them manifested as acute cord compression, the other two as chronic progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. A total excision or subtotal excision with irradiation was performed. All of them had good functional recovery. The clinical picture, radiological diagnosis, and optimal method of treatment are discussed. The relevant literature is reviewed. 
5	Cerebral infarction: early detection by means of contrast-enhanced cerebral arteries at MR imaging. The authors describe a new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sign of acute cerebral ischemia/infarction. Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of cerebral ischemia/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images. The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank brain infarction. This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up MR examinations. Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear. 
5	Characterization of a rat pancreatic secretory protein associated with pancreatitis. A new protein was purified from the pancreatic juice of rats with acute pancreatitis. That protein, not detectable in control animals, was called "pancreatitis-associated protein." It was first observed 6 hours after induction of experimental pancreatitis with taurocholate or cerulein, reached maximal levels of 45 micrograms/mg protein in zymogen granules and 1.8 micrograms/mg protein in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase (48 hours), and disappeared during recovery (day 5). It was never detected in spleen, liver, kidney, heart, or lung. The detection limit of the assay system was 12 ng/mg protein, so that pancreatitis-associated protein levels increased at least 100-fold in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase. The molecular weight (12,000) and isoelectric point (8.2) were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy showed that the protein was synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stored in zymogen granules before being secreted, similar to other pancreatic secretory proteins. Immunoblotting and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the same protein was synthesized upon induction of pancreatitis by cerulein infusion, by retrograde injection of bile acids, or pancreatitis induced by pancreatic surgery. The pancreatitis-associated protein is therefore an acute-phase protein that differs from other proteins of that family because of its exocrine nature. 
5	Outpatient management of burns in children. The majority of burn wound management can be performed on an outpatient basis by the primary care physician or emergency physician. The physician, however, needs to know when to refer the patient for surgical evaluation and must be reasonably certain that the family will be compliant with wound care and follow-up. Fire prevention counselling still remains one of the most important aspects of burn management. 
4	Admission and mid-stay MedisGroups scores as predictors of death within 30 days of hospital admission. We examined the ability of MedisGroups, a severity measure based on clinical data abstracted from the medical record, to predict mortality 30 days following admission. MedisGroups measures severity both on admission and approximately one week into the hospital stay. The data base was a random sample of 20,985 admissions of Medicare beneficiaries with one of six conditions from 833 hospitals in seven states between January 1985 and May 1986. In all six conditions, higher admission and mid-stay severity scores were generally associated with higher risk of death. Across the six conditions, the R-squared values for predicting death using admission scores ranged from 0.01 to 0.16; R-squared values using mid-stay scores ranged from 0.03 to 0.34; and R-squared values from combining admission and mid-stay scores ranged from 0.05 to 0.41. Admission MedisGroups score was thus only modestly predictive of 30-day mortality. While the mid-stay score was more powerful, it may not be an appropriate severity adjuster to screen for quality using hospital mortality rates because it could be influenced by substandard care. 
4	Comparison of SPECT using technetium-99m agents and thallium-201 and PET for the assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability. This report reviews the applications of tomographic imaging with current and new tracers in assessing myocardial perfusion and viability. Multiple studies with thallium-201 (TI-201) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) have demonstrated high sensitivity, high rates of normalcy and high reproducibility. In assessing viability, fixed defects are frequently detected in viable zones in 4-hour studies with TI-201 imaging. Redistribution imaging performed 18 to 72 hours after injection or reinjection of TI-201 before 4-hour redistribution imaging has been shown to improve accuracy of viability assessment. TI-201 SPECT studies are limited by the suboptimal physical properties of TI-201, which result in variable image quality. The 2 new technetium-99m (Tc-99m) - labeled myocardial perfusion tracers offer the ability to inject much higher amounts of radioactivity, making it possible to assess ventricular function as well as myocardial perfusion from the same injection of radiotracer. Tc-99m sestamibi has very slow myocardial clearance, which allows for prolonged imaging time and results in image quality superior to that obtained with TI-201 and Tc-99m teboroxime. The combination of minimal redistribution of Tc-99m sestamibi and high count rates makes gated SPECT imaging feasible, and also permits assessment of patients with acute ischemic syndromes by uncoupling the time of injection from the time of imaging. The combination of high image quality and first-pass exercise capabilities may lead to a choice of this agent over TI-201 for assessment of chronic CAD. 
5	Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man. Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon. 
5	Splicing defect at the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) locus in gyrate atrophy. Gyrate atrophy (GA), a recessive eye disease involving progressive vision loss due to chorioretinal degeneration, is associated with the deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), with consequent hyperornithinemia. We and others have reported a number of missense mutations at the OAT locus which result in GA. Here we report a GA patient of Danish/Swedish ancestry in whom one OAT allele produces an mRNA that is missing a single 96-bp exon relative to the normal mRNA. Polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and sequencing revealed a 9-bp deletion covering the splice acceptor region of exon 5, resulting in the absence of exon 5 sequences from the mRNA with no disruption to the reading frame. This mutation, which was not present in 15 other independent GA patients, adds to the array of allelic heterogeneity observed in GA and represents the first example of a splicing mutation associated with this disorder. 
3	Results of treatment of displaced patellar fractures by partial patellectomy. The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures. 
4	Inability to demonstrate physiologic correlates of subjective improvement among patients taught the relaxation response. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the regular elicitation of the relaxation response produces sustained physiologic changes coincident with symptomatic relief or improved psychological state. DESIGN: Prospective, cohort pilot study. SETTING: Clinical research center within a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirteen athletic men, mean age 44.8 years, with borderline or labile hypertension, taking no medication. All 13 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Three baseline assessments of psychological state, symptom checklist, and assessment of autonomic response to infusion of beta agonist (isoproterenol). Daily relaxation response exercises for five consecutive weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Discontinuation of relaxation exercises for subsequent five weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Measurements and main results: After eliciting the relaxation response, subjects demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (p less than 0.014) and somatic symptoms (p less than 0.02). Psychological and somatic variables returned toward baseline after the subsequent discontinuation of relaxation exercises. No significant concomitant change in urinary catecholamines, heart rate response to isoproterenol, blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum cholesterol was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The regular elicitation of the relaxation response can improve psychological performance and reduce symptoms. However, the physiologic mechanism whereby these psychological and symptomatic improvements occur remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation. 
1	A palmar dermatosis linked to occult carcinoma of the upper thorax, head and neck: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. An unusual, persistent, corregated-to-honeycombed thickening of the palms accompanied by tenderness around the fingernails was found to be a cutaneous marker for internal malignancy. This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor. In our patient, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung not detectable on chest x-ray presented as a cervical mass accompanied by cutaneous changes on the palms and fingernails. Recognition of the relationship of the dermatologic changes to malignancy of a specific body region eventually led to the detection of the primary tumor. The characteristics of these paraneoplastic syndromes were reviewed in this report. 
1	Possible etiologic heterogeneity of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A correlation of pathologic characteristics with human papillomavirus detection by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. A correlated histopathologic and molecular virologic study of 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (VIN 3) and six associated invasive vulvar carcinomas was performed. Paraffin sections were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of HPV and of the beta-globin gene. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 was histologically subclassified into warty (bowenoid) (20 cases) and basaloid (undifferentiated) (ten cases) types. Warty VIN characteristically was composed of squamous cells displaying abnormal proliferation and maturation and an undulating or spiked surface creating a "condylomatous" appearance whereas basaloid VIN had a smooth surface and was composed of undifferentiated basaloid cells resembling carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Human papillomavirus-16 was the only type detected in 16 of 30 VIN 3 and in five of six invasive carcinomas. The HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women (mean age at diagnosis, 49 versus 60 years), their lesions more frequently demonstrated koilocytotic atypia (94% versus 43%), and they were more likely to have warty compared with basaloid VIN lesions (65% versus 30%). These findings suggest that there are at least two different types of VIN which have differing clinical, pathologic, and viral profiles. 
3	Fetal homotransplants (ventral mesencephalon and adrenal tissue) to the striatum of parkinsonian subjects. Fetal ventral mesencephalon and fetal adrenal tissue grafted to the caudate nucleus of four and three parkinsonian patients, respectively, have been shown to be an alternative treatment for the amelioration of the signs of the disease. The ventral mesencephalon patients had a significant amelioration of rigidity, bradykinesia, postural imbalance, gait disturbance, and facial expression. Three of these four patients have returned to work. The fatal adrenal group only showed amelioration of rigidity and bradykinesia. Though these patients are now able to perform their basic daily living activities, and one of them has renewed her household tasks, the other two have not yet been able to return to work. The differences observed between the ventral mesencephalon- and the fetal adrenal-transplanted patients may be related to the heterogeneity of their disease and/or the type of graft implanted. However encouraging our results may be, this experimental procedure obviously requires further studies, and should not be practiced outside of highly qualified clinical research centers. 
4	Infectious intracranial aneurysms: comparison of groups with and without endocarditis. A series of 12 patients with infectious intracranial aneurysms is presented, and a number of unusual features of the disorder are emphasized. A comparison of characteristics of the aneurysms and clinical course is made between patients with and without infective endocarditis. Most of the unusual characteristics of infectious aneurysms, including rare locations, causative organisms, and predisposing medical conditions, occurred in the group without endocarditis. The relationship of atypical features of infectious aneurysms to the etiology of aneurysm formation is discussed, and an approach to treatment is presented. 
5	Intrathoracic current flow during transthoracic defibrillation in dogs. Transcardiac current fraction. To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso. This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents). Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%. The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways. Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs. With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model. The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs. The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart. There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC. Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%. Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current. 
4	Left ventricular end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in aortic and mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction. To evaluate the left ventricular contractile state in regurgitant valvular disease with normal ejection fraction, we analyzed the end-systolic stress-volume index relationship (ESSVR) by means of cineangiography in 15 normal subjects, 11 patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), and 10 patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) whose ejection fraction (EF) was 60% or more. The end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in normal subjects was 5.57 +/- 0.60 kdyne/cm5/m2 (mean +/- standard deviation), and we defined the range including +/- 2 standard deviations of the ratio as the normal ESSVR range. Six patients with AR and five patients with MR placed inside the normal ESSVR range, termed AR IN and MR IN, but the remaining five patients with AR and MR placed to the right of the normal range, termed AR OUT and MR OUT. EF did not differ between patients with AR IN and AR OUT (69.4 +/- 5.4 verus 70.7 +/- 6.1%) and between MR IN and MR OUT (71.6 +/- 3.6 versus 71.1 +/- 7.9%). The EF of the subdivided groups with AR and MR also did not differ from that of normal subjects (70.7 +/- 7.3%). This finding showed that the left ventricular contractile state was depressed in patients with AR OUT and MR OUT despite a normal EF. In AR and MR the end-systolic stress and end-systolic volume index of OUT did not differ from those of IN, but the end-diastolic volume index of OUT was larger than that of IN (AR OUT 156.8 +/- 27.9 versus AR IN 110.8 +/- 24.1 ml/m2, MR OUT 160.5 +/- 44.7 versus MR IN 101.0 +/ 16.6 ml/m2; both p less than 0.05), and the regurgitant fraction of OUT was higher than that of IN (AR OUT 52.6 +/- 13.6 versus AR IN 29.7 +/- 13.3%, MR OUT 52.9 +/- 10.2 versus MR IN 30.2 +/- 11.4%; both p less than 0.05). In addition, there was a linear inverse correlation between the end-systolic stress-volume index ratio and the end-diastolic volume index in all subjects (r = -0.82, n = 36). In normal subjects there was a linear inverse correlation between end-systolic stress and the EF (r = -0.91, n = 15), but this relationship failed to separate patients with OUT from those with IN. Results of the present study suggest that some patients with AR and MR whose EF was normal had a depressed contractile state, and these patients had a large end-diastolic volume index and a high regurgitant fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Isovolumic hemodilution with dextran 40 in the rat: effect on the development of peripheral edema and various physiologic parameters. Low molecular weight dextran 40 (D40), 40,000 daltons, is a potential therapeutic agent for cerebral ischemia because it increases local cerebral blood flow. However, the evaluation of D40 in the rat has been difficult due to systemic effects. We evaluated the effects of isovolumic hemodilution with D40 on the development of peripheral edema, mean arterial pressure, hematocrit (Hct) and total blood volume in 18 rats, during 30 min or 4 hr i.v. infusions, in animals with and without previous challenge with D40. Reduction of Hct without peripheral edema to a mean of approximately 31% was only achieved in the animals challenged with i.p. D40 24 hr before hemodilution and who received D40 over a period of 4 hr. Infusion of D40 over a period of 30 min was associated with shorter survival time, compared to the 4-hr infusion group (P less than .005). In the pretreated, rapidly infused group, total blood volume per body weight decreased significantly over time (P less than .005) and the mean arterial blood pressure dropped, but not significantly (P less than .07), whereas no change in Hct was detected and there was a trend toward increased peripheral edema, relative to the slowly infused groups. We conclude that reduction of Hct can be achieved successfully with i.p. administration of D40 24 hr before the study combined with infusion of the agent during a 4-hr period, without significant peripheral edema and early hypotension. This procedure should be used to avoid allergic reactions when evaluating hemodilution with D40 in rats. 
5	Fibrosing mediastinitis with coronary artery involvement. This case report describes a patient with chronic fibrosing mediastinitis involving the entire intrapericardial aorta, innominate artery, and the base of the heart with involvement of the proximal segments of the coronary arteries. This finding was unsuspected before emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary stenosis due to fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare complication of fibrosing mediastinitis. Owing to the extensive fibrosis, the normal bypass, cardiac preservation, and revascularization techniques required alteration and are discussed. 
5	The Dutch experience in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of narrowed saphenous veins used for aortocoronary arterial bypass. Of 19,994 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures performed in The Netherlands between April 1980 and January 1989, the long-term follow-up of 454 patients who underwent angioplasty of greater than or equal to 1 saphenous vein bypass graft was reviewed. In 46% of patients single graft angioplasty was attempted, and in 54% of patients sequential graft angioplasty was attempted. The clinical primary success rate was 90%. In-hospital mortality was 0.7%, 2.8% of patients sustained a procedural myocardial infarction, and 1.3% of patients underwent emergency bypass surgery. After a follow-up period of 5 years, 74% of patients were alive, and 26% were alive and event-free (no myocardial infarction, no repeat bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty). In patients in whom the initial angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful, only 3% were event-free at 5 years, versus 27% of successfully dilated patients. The time interval between the angioplasty attempt and previous surgery was a significant predictor for 5-year event-free survival. The event-free survival rates for patients who had bypass surgery 1 year before, between 1 and 5 years, and 5 years before angioplasty, were 45, 25 and 19%, respectively. Less than one-third of patients with previous bypass surgery who had angioplasty of the graft remained event-free after 5 years. In patients needing angioplasty within 1 year after bypass surgery, better long-term results were achieved. 
2	Effect of intraesophageal location and muscarinic blockade on balloon distension-induced chest pain. Intraesophageal balloon distension has been introduced recently as a provocative test in the assessment of patients with noncardiac chest pain. In order to examine the effect of balloon location and muscarinic blockade on distension-induced pain, 10 asymptomatic male volunteers were studied on two separate days using a low-compliance perfused manometry system that incorporated a silicone rubber balloon. Five-second-duration balloon distensions using balloon volumes of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 ml of air were performed with the balloon located both 16 cm (proximal site) and 6 cm (distal site) above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) before and after administration of atropine (10 micrograms/kg intravenously) or placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. A standardized scoring system was used to assess the balloon distension-induced pain. Pain scores varied directly with balloon volume but were consistently higher with the balloon located at the proximal site versus the distal site. This was not associated with any differences in intraballoon pressures between the two sites; however, contraction amplitude orad to the balloon was greater with balloon distension at the proximal site. Atropine significantly decreased pain sensation scores with the balloon located distally but not proximally. This attenuation was not associated with significant changes in intraballoon pressures; however, contractions orad to the balloon were markedly inhibited by atropine with distal but not with proximal distension. These studies indicate that balloon distension-induced pain varies depending on the location of distension. This difference is not explained by differences in esophageal wall tension at the site of distension. 
1	Inheritance of proliferative breast disease in breast cancer kindreds. Previous studies have emphasized that genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is rare and is expressed primarily as premenopausal breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or both. Proliferative breast disease (PBD) is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer and appears to be a precursor lesion. PBD and breast cancer were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with breast cancer and in 31 control women. Physical examination, screening mammography, and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed. Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35% of clinically normal female first degree relatives of breast cancer cases and in 13% of controls. Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and breast cancer in these kindreds. This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of breast cancer, including unilateral and postmenopausal breast cancer. 
5	The detubularized right colonic segment as urinary reservoir: evolution of technique for continent diversion. Continent diversion of urine via a cecal-right colonic reservoir has been performed at our university hospital since 1977. Several modifications of surgical technique have been devised to prevent problems of urinary leakage and difficulties in catheterization. The current technique, used during the last 3 years on 14 patients, involves use of a detubularized right colonic segment as a reservoir, ileal mesenteric exclusion, fashioning the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve with staples and anchoring of a fascia strip sling around the nipple base to the anterior rectus sheath. Complication from the reservoir outlet occurred in only 1 patient. 
5	The lovastatin-treated rodent: a new model of barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia. Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier. To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis, we applied lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to hairless mouse skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) began to increase after four to six daily applications. Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL, demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion. The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis. Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis, with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized, while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly. Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal, the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption. Finally, morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited, intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities. Thus, the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure. 
1	Stimulation of tumor cell growth by vasoactive intestinal peptide. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated the growth of murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells in culture. The growth promoting effect was dependent on the concentration of VIP. Exposure to VIP for 12 hours followed by removal of the peptide resulted in sustained growth promotion for 4 to 5 days in culture. Synthetic fragments of VIP, i.e., VIP (1-16) and VIP (22-28), and the unrelated peptide neurotensin failed to stimulate the growth of the Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The growth-promoting effect of VIP was also observed in a murine mammary tumor cell line and a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. 
4	Significance of the number of stimuli to initiate ouabain-induced arrhythmias in the intact heart. Ouabain-induced arrhythmias are a well-known model used to study triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations. In the intact heart, initiation of these arrhythmias is promoted by pacing, especially at fast rates. However, the relevance of the number of stimuli is unknown. In conscious dogs with formalin-induced atrioventricular block, we investigated the effect of variations in pacing mode on 1) the behavior of nonsustained triggered rhythms at progressive levels of ouabain intoxication, and 2) the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Twenty experiments were analyzed. Ouabain was administered as a bolus of 40 micrograms/kg followed by continuous infusion. Every 15 minutes the pacing protocol was repeated, with a maximum of 10, until completion or induction of VT. When VT could not be initiated, the experiment was repeated at least 1 week later, adding 5-10 micrograms/kg ouabain to the bolus and increasing the infusion rate correspondingly. This was repeated until VT could be induced. Four interstimulus intervals (200, 400, 600, and 800 msec) and seven numbers of stimuli (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, and 150) were given in two pacing protocols. The effect of these protocols on 1) the number of induced beats per stimulation train, 2) their first postpacing interval, and 3) induction of VT were studied. Initiation of VT occurred after 75 +/- 42 minutes. The bolus of ouabain needed to induce VT was inversely related to the body weight of the animals. Progression of ouabain intoxication resulted in 1) a significant increase in the number of induced beats per stimulation train and 2) a significant shortening of the first postpacing interval. Stimulation at a faster rate and/or more stimuli resulted in 1) a significantly pronounced increase in the number of induced beats at the higher levels and 2) a significantly shorter first postpacing interval at successive levels of ouabain intoxication. 
1	Antibodies to synthetic peptide (125-148) of the alpha-subunit of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in sera from patients with myasthenia gravis. We measured the amount of antibodies to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the alpha-subunit residues Lys125-Thr148 of human acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in myasthenic sera. We detected anti-peptide antibodies in 52% (89/171) of the patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but none in any of the healthy controls. Anti-peptide antibodies should provide a valuable immunologic parameter for the clinical evaluation of MG, but no apparent correlation was observed between the titers of anti-peptide and anti-AChR antibodies. 
3	Trichothiodystrophy with chronic neutropenia and mild mental retardation. Trichothiodystrophy is a feature of several diseases that consist of characteristic hair shaft abnormalities and a wide spectrum of other developmental defects. Detection of sulfur-deficient hairs identifies this disorder and separates it from other similar ectodermal dysplasias with normal sulfur content. Detection of low sulfur hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling, because the disease appears to be an autosomal recessive trait. We report a patient with chronic neutropenia, mild mental retardation, and low sulfur content in hair. Our case expands the spectrum of disorders associated with trichothiodystrophy. 
4	Transcranial Doppler determination of cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing CPR: methodology and preliminary findings. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To correlate cerebral arterial blood velocity measurements as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound with various resuscitation maneuvers performed in an uncontrolled manner in a series of cardiac arrest patients undergoing standard resuscitation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Any patient undergoing resuscitation for a nontraumatic cardiac arrest was eligible for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was carried out while flow velocities were monitored in various intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Vessel identification was based on the angle and depth of insonation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internal carotid artery was located more consistently than either middle cerebral or ophthalmic arteries and provided superior waveforms for analysis. Alterations in flow velocity were noted and correlated to various therapeutic interventions. Flow velocities were 70% of normal during the early phase of resuscitation but deteriorated over time until there was no evidence of net forward flow. Even early in CPR, flow was demonstrated only during systole. CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound appears to be a potentially promising means of determining cerebral flow in patients undergoing CPR. 
2	Successful treatment of pancreatic pseudocyst with a somatostatin analogue and catheter drainage. We report a patient with bile duct stone-induced pancreatitis who subsequently developed a large pseudocyst that became infected after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was done for extraction of the stones. Percutaneous external drainage allowed control of the infection, but failed to seal the pseudocyst. We then treated the patient with a long-acting somatostatin analogue which shrunk the cyst within a week. Patients with pancreatic pseudocyst resistant to drainage should be offered a course of somatostatin before surgery is contemplated. 
1	The relationship of "high risk" mammographic patterns to histological risk factors for development of cancer in the human breast. In the UK Trial for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Nottingham, 119 women were identified as having fibrocystic change with epithelial hyperplasia or in situ carcinoma. Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe's criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page's criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns, N1, P1, P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern, using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation. 
5	Urinary tract infection in women. Current role of single-dose therapy. Administration of a single dose of an antimicrobial agent is acceptable therapy for women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. There is adequate information in the literature to support the clinical use of single-dose therapy, although there is still a need for further, well-designed, sufficiently large studies that compare single-dose therapy to abbreviated-course (3-day) and traditional (7- to 14-day) therapy. 
5	Results of vein graft reconstruction of the lower extremity in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The results of 171 vein grafts of the lower extremity were evaluated. These were placed between January 1981 and December 1987 in 150 patients, 75 diabetic and 75 nondiabetic, to determine the influence of diabetes on the outcome of the procedure. One and four year patency rates were determined by a life table analysis. No statistical differences in primary patency were found between the patients with diabetes and those without diabetes for all indications of operations (one year, diabetic patients 95 +/- 3 per cent, nondiabetic patients 85 +/- 3 per cent; four years, diabetic patients 89 +/- 11 per cent and nondiabetic patients 80 +/- 12 per cent; p = n.s.). For those operated upon for salvage of the limb because of rest pain, ulceration or gangrene, patency in diabetic patients at one year approached a statistically significant advantage (diabetic patients 94 +/- 4 per cent versus nondiabetic patients 79 +/- 8 per cent; p = 0.056). We believe that arterial reconstruction of the lower extremity can be performed upon patients with diabetes with the same high degree of success for revascularization and salvage of the limb as can be accomplished in nondiabetic patients. This is true even though those with diabetes present with necrosis of the tissue and more often require bypass to distal tibial arteries. 
3	Effect of normal MSAFP screening on maternal age for genetic amniocentesis. Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening for neural tube defects is considered by many to be standard obstetrical care, and recently many have encouraged this test to screen for Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome). We questioned whether, after a normal MSAFP screen, the risk of Trisomy-21 decreases enough to warrant modifying the recommended age for genetic amniocentesis for Down's syndrome. A logistic regression was developed which, using reported values for sensitivity and specificity for MSAFP detection of Trisomy-21 and assuming a constant threshold risk in opting for amniocentesis, indicates that genetic amniocentesis for Trisomy-21 may be deferred in some women who have a normal MSAFP screening. Sensitivity analysis of varying thresholds for a normal MSAFP demonstrates that a 37 year old woman with a median MSAFP level has the same risk for Trisomy-21 as an unscreened women who is 4.5 years younger. An abnormal MSAFP is useful in screening for neural tube defects and possibly for Trisomy-21. A normal MSAFP may allow for delaying the potentially risky amniocentesis in otherwise low-risk pregnancies. 
5	Use of a knee-brace for control of tibial translation and rotation. A comparison, in cadavera, of available models. We assessed the relative restraints that are provided by fourteen currently available functional knee-braces, using six limbs in cadavera. The tests were made at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion of the knee, and a mechanical loading system applied loads that caused anterior-posterior translation and internal-external rotation. The braces limited abnormal tibiofemoral displacements by 10 to 75 per cent in translation; there was more variation in rotation. This study demonstrated that functional knee-braces provide a restraining influence that may be beneficial in the control of abnormal displacements of the knee, but that the degree of restraint varies considerably. 
4	Comparison of early versus late experience with percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty. The immediate outcome of the first 150 patients (Group 1) and the last 161 patients (Group 2) who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty was compared. There was no difference between the two groups in age, gender, New York Heart Association functional class, presence of calcification, atrial fibrillation, degree of mitral regurgitation, mean pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral valve gradient and mitral valve area. Fewer patients in Group 1 than Group 2 had an echocardiographic score less than or equal to 8 (62% versus 69%, respectively, p = 0.02). The atrial septum was dilated with an 8 mm balloon in 74% of patients in Group 1 and with a 5 mm balloon in all patients in Group 2. Ratio of effective balloon dilating area to body surface area was larger in Group 1 than in Group 2 (4.05 +/- 0.07 versus 3.7 +/- 0.03 cm2/m2, p = 0.0001). A good result (mitral valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2) was obtained in 77% and 75% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = NS). After percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, a greater than or equal to 2 grade increase in mitral regurgitation was noted in 12% of Group 1 and 6% of Group 2 (p = 0.02) and a left to right shunt was detected in 22% of Group 1 and 11% of Group 2 (p = 0.0001). There were three procedure-related deaths in Group 1, but none in Group 2. 
3	Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system: I. Intraventricular and extracerebral lesions. The results of observations of the first 100 neonates at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who received magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system by means of a high-field image (1.5 T) are reported. All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project. 
4	Prevention of paraplegia during aortic operations. Ischemic spinal cord injury after aortic cross-clamping may be produced by a steal phenomenon. The present study investigates this possibility by directly measuring the oxygen tension on the spinal cord surface in pigs. After simple clamping of the aorta, oxygen tension decreased significantly distal to the clamping site both after occlusion of the thoracic aorta at T3-4 (group 1) and after occlusion of the abdominal aorta at L-1 (group 2). Exclusion of the thoracic aorta by a second clamp at T-13 restored oxygen tension almost to the original level, whereas segmentation of the abdominal aorta up to S-1 hardly affected oxygen tension in the area of the artery of Adamkiewicz in most of the animals. We conclude that after aortic cross-clamping, blood tends to drain away from the spinal cord rather than supplying it longitudinally. Without knowledge of the position of the Adamkiewicz artery in humans as well as of the competence of the collateral circulation in the excluded segment, it is necessary to develop a new strategy for repair of the aorta. We describe and discuss two surgical techniques for the prevention of paraplegia after aortic cross-clamping: the counterocclusion technique and the bypass fractionated technique. 
5	Expert testimony based on decision analysis: a malpractice case report. OBJECTIVE: Expert testimony in malpractice cases is often subjective and biased. Decision-analytic techniques might provide an objective basis for such testimony. DESIGN: Case report. This article reports the case of a patient with chest pain that resulted in a malpractice suit alleging a delay in diagnosis of coronary artery disease. SETTING: The case occurred in a private practice; the expert witnesses and the decision analysis originated from a university teaching hospital. METHODS: A decision tree and threshold analysis were used to define the thresholds of disease probability at which either testing or treatment should be implemented. The expert testimony of two witnesses that exercise stress testing was the standard of care was compared with the results of the decision analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Decision analysis supported the view that cardiac catheterization would have been the more appropriate test. CONCLUSIONS: Techniques of decision analysis provide a structured and quantitative basis for empirical judgment and may help to minimize current problems with expert testimony. 
4	Renal effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in congestive heart failure. Some studies report that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) improves renal function in patients with congestive heart failure, whereas others report that renal deterioration is a frequent complication of treatment with ACE inhibitors. This article explores the mechanisms by which antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system improves kidney function in some patients while causing harm in others. ACE inhibition may alter renal blood flow, glomerular perfusion pressure, basement membrane activity and renal tubular function both directly and indirectly. In most patients, renal function is maintained as other neurohormonal mechanisms compensate for the negative effects and permit the positive effects (such as improved renal flow) to predominate. However, when physiologic characteristics or iatrogenic interventions (such as volume reduction or prostaglandin inhibition) limit the effectiveness of neurohormonal compensation to maintain renal autoregulation, clinically important deterioration in renal function may occur. An understanding of the renal effects of ACE inhibitors permits their safe and effective use in most patients with congestive heart failure. 
4	A 5.3-kb deletion including exon XIII of the protein S alpha gene occurs in two protein S-deficient families. Genomic DNA samples from 12 protein S-deficient families with hereditary thrombophilia were analyzed by Southern hybridization using protein S cDNA probes. Protein S-deficient members of families A and B possessed identical restriction fragment length polymorphisms, which suggest the absence of 5.3 kb from one of their protein S alpha alleles. The abnormal alleles from individuals A7 and B1 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer in intron K and a reverse primer in exon XIV. The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison with the normal protein S alpha gene showed that most of intron L (roughly 4.7 kb), the entire exon XIII (151 bp), and about a quarter of intron M (407 bp) were missing from both the A7 and B1 clones. Exon XIII contains all three potential N-glycosylation sites in human protein S. This deletion may result in RNA transcripts in which exon XII is spliced to exon XIV. Such an arrangement would generate a stop codon at position 463 and consequently produce a nonglycosylated protein S molecule truncated by 173 amino acids. 
2	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. 
3	Normal proprioceptive trigeminal afferents in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and sensory neuronopathy. A pure sensory neuropathy due to neuronal damage in the gasserian and spinal ganglia has been described in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Conventional electromyographic (EMG) studies can demonstrate the selective involvement of the sensory pathways but they do not provide definite evidence for the site of the lesion. Noting that the trigeminal sensory neurons carrying cutaneous and muscular afferents are differentially located in the gasserian and mesencephalic nuclei, respectively, we carried out an electrophysiological study of the trigeminofacial and trigeminotrigeminal reflexes in 5 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy, in 10 patients with sensory-motor neuropathies of other causes, and in 10 healthy subjects. Our results show that patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy who exhibited abnormal blink reflexes and an abnormal, cutaneous-induced masseter silent period had normal jaw jerks, whereas patients with sensory-motor neuropathies who exhibited abnormal cutaneous responses had abnormal jaw jerks. These findings suggest that the lesion in pure sensory neuropathy involves damage to the neurons of the gasserian ganglia and not to the trigeminal axons, since an axonal lesion would be expected to involve the large axons from muscle spindle receptors. 
5	Combined modality therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. Multi-modality treatment consisting of cisplatin, VP-16, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy given concomitantly with external beam radiation was used to treat 64 patients with locally advanced Stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma. This regimen was used in a preoperative fashion for four cycles in patients considered surgically resectable and with curative intent for six cycles in the remainder of patients. The clinical response rate for the entire group was 84% and the overall local control rate was 74%. The median survival was 13 months with a median follow-up for live patients of 19 months. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 30% and 23%, respectively. Histologic complete response was 39% and appeared to predict for survival. The 3-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival rates for 23 resected patients were 69% and 45%, respectively, with the complete histologic responders having a disease-free survival of 78%. The pattern of first recurrence did not appear to differ by histology or presence of lymph nodes in this subset of patients. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates for inoperable patients receiving six cycles of treatment were 18% and 23%, respectively. The local control was 67% with the majority of these patients having Stage IIIB disease. The Mountain International staging system appeared to predict for operability, local recurrence, and survival. This concomitant treatment regimen is feasible, with the major toxicities being leukopenia, nausea, and vomiting. 
1	High-risk factors in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The patient with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia faces a number of risks; the greatest is the failure of current treatment to bring about remission. Based on a review of past experience, a number of risk factors associated with failure of single-agent chemotherapy were identified, and the subsequent utilization of combination chemotherapy led to an improved outcome. An analysis of more recent experience has identified factors associated with the failure of standard combination chemotherapy, and it is hoped that the development of new treatments will again improve the outcome. This review provides a perspective on known high-risk factors in light of contemporary treatment. 
1	A prospective study of double diagnosis of nonpalpable lesions of the breast. Approximately three-fourths of open biopsies of the breast performed for mammographically detected suspicious lesions are shown histologically to be benign. Under the narrow conditions described herein, stereotaxic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can identify these lesions with an accuracy of more than 90 per cent and a false-negative rate of 5 per cent. In an effort to reduce this failure rate, the mammographic appearance and stereotaxic FNA results of these lesions each were given scores on a scale of zero (benign) to five (malignant), to derive an over-all risk score prospectively applied to 264 suspicious occult lesions of the breast prior to open, biopsy. While all 264 lesions could be assigned a mammographic score, adequate tissue for assignment of a cytologic score could be obtained from 150 lesions. Of the 150 evaluable lesions, 53 were malignant and 97 were benign, historically. With a total score of two as the threshold for open biopsy, 21 of 150 (14 per cent) were proved to be benign, with no false-negative findings. If the total threshold score mandating an open biopsy was raised to four, the comparable figures were 61 of 150 (40 per cent) benign lesions and two false-negative instances of carcinoma in situ. Provided adequate tissue is aspirated for cytologic examination, we conclude that this algorithm has practical value in the management of nonpalpable lesions of the breast in that it can reliably identify a fraction of the benign lesions and spare these patients an operation. 
4	Acute myocardial infarction and chest pain syndromes after cocaine use. Seventy patients hospitalized with chest pain after cocaine use were retrospectively evaluated to define the risk and clinical course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI developed in 22 patients (31%) and transient myocardial ischemia was seen in an additional 9 patients (13%). Coronary risk factors did not distinguish those who developed AMI from those who did not. The presenting electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 of 22 patients who evolved AMI and in 19 of 48 of those who did not. Creatine kinase levels were elevated in 75% of the patients, including 65% of those who did not develop AMI, but creatine kinase-MB elevations were only observed in the AMI group. The route of cocaine administration did not predict AMI and there was no predilection for a particular coronary vascular bed. The length of time between drug use and onset of AMI pain was often quite prolonged (median interval, 18 vs 1 hour in the non-AMI group). Eight of the patients with AMI underwent cardiac catheterization and 4 had significant coronary narrowing. 
2	Persistent hepatitis B virus following interferon alfa therapy and liver transplantation. A 44-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and cirrhosis was treated with recombinant human interferon alfa for 67 days immediately before orthotopic liver transplantation and immunoprophylaxis with hyperimmune globulin to hepatitis B virus in the peritransplant period. Dot blots for hepatitis B virus DNA demonstrated marked reduction in viremia after 41 days of interferon alfa treatment. Southern analysis for hepatitis B virus in liver showed a pronounced decrement in actively replicating forms in the explant, although hepatic infection was still detectable. After liver transplantation, tests for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen remained negative. The patient died 32 days after transplantation of causes unrelated to hepatitis B virus. DNA isolated from liver and other visceral organs at autopsy showed infection of the engrafted liver and the persistence of monomeric relaxed circular forms of hepatitis B virus DNA in pancreas, kidney, and spleen. Thus, graft reinfection occurred despite aggressive antiviral therapy and immunoprophylaxis combined with liver transplantation. Existing viral serological markers appear insufficiently sensitive to assess residual infectivity. 
5	Reduced atrial contribution to left ventricular filling in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid valvulectomy: a Doppler echocardiographic study. Patients undergoing valvulectomy for isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis offer the unique opportunity to study the effects of acquired right ventricular volume overload on left ventricular filling in persons free of pulmonary hypertension and preexisting left heart disease. Eleven patients who had undergone total or partial removal of the tricuspid valve were compared with 11 age-matched control subjects; Doppler echocardiographic techniques were used to quantify changes in left ventricular filling and to relate them to changes in left ventricular and left atrial geometry caused by right ventricular and right atrial distension. The late diastolic fractional transmitral flow velocity integral, a measure of the left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, was significantly decreased in patients undergoing tricuspid valvulectomy compared with control subjects (0.22 +/- 0.11 versus 0.32 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.04). Severe tricuspid regurgitation in these patients resulted in marked right atrial distension, reversal of the normal interatrial septal curvature and compression of the left atrium such that left atrial area was significantly smaller than in control subjects (5.9 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 cm2/m2; p less than 0.005). Acting as a receiving chamber, the left ventricle was maximally compressed by the volume-overloaded right ventricle in late diastole, coincident with the timing of atrial systole, resulting in a significant increase in the left ventricular eccentricity index compared with that in control subjects (1.35 +/- 0.14 versus 1.03 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). Thus, right ventricular volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation results in left heart geometric alterations that decrease left atrial preload, impair left ventricular receiving chamber characteristics and reduce the atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling. 
5	Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
1	Flow cytometry for clinical estimation of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation in cancer patients. Optimum methods of harvesting circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation to support myeloablative cancer therapy are still uncertain, mostly because of the lack of an assay for marrow-repopulating stem cells. The CFU-GM assay, the commonly used indirect indicator of the quality of the graft, is poorly standardized and provides results evaluable only retrospectively. Based on the knowledge that hematopoietic progenitors express CD34 and CD33 differentiation antigens, we developed a dual-color direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry assay with the aim of replacing the CFU-GM assay advantageously. For this purpose, we applied both assays to 157 blood samples obtained daily throughout 20 different recoveries from pancytopenia induced by high-dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide cancer therapy with or without recombinant human GM colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). The appearance of CD34+ cells in the circulation indicated that hematopoietic progenitors had increased to more than 500 CFU-GM/mL, a level clinically adequate for large-scale harvest by leukapheresis. Total CD34+ cells correlated well with CFU-GM (r = .89), and data could be fitted by a linear regression line described by the equation y = 388.3 + 64.0x, where y = CFU-GM/mL and x = CD34+ cells per microliter. Moreover, in a series of six patients treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy, early hematopoietic recovery of marrow functions was predicted more accurately by the number of transplanted CD34+/CD33+ cells than by either total nucleated cells, CFU-GM, CD34+/CD33- cells, or CD34-/CD33+ cells. Data presented in this article favor clinical use of the CD34/CD33 flow cytometry assay to guide harvesting of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation and contribute to better understanding of the role played by circulating hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets in marrow recovery after myeloablative cancer therapy. 
5	Profound digital collagen atrophy: a new cutaneous presentation of adrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome. A 59-year-old Caucasian housewife presented with a 2-year history of marked loss of tissue substance from the finger and toe pulps and the heel pads. There was no clinical evidence or history of urticaria or other inflammatory change. Investigations demonstrated a raised plasma cortisol secondary to a left adrenal adenoma. Skin biopsies showed abnormalities of dermal collagen, but no evidence of elastin destruction. This case presents an unusual variant of the cutaneous atrophy associated with Cushing's syndrome. 
3	Naproxen sodium in menstrual migraine prophylaxis: a double-blind placebo controlled study. In this study, the efficacy of Naproxen sodium (Nxs) in the prophylaxis of Menstrual Migraine (MM) was tested, versus Placebo (PL). Forty women suffering from MM were admitted to a double-blind treatment protocol with Nxs 550 mg twice each day by mouth or Placebo (PL), for 3 months; in the next 3 months all the women were treated with the active drug in an open study. The headache intensity and duration, as well as the number of days of headache and the analgesic consumption, were significantly reduced with Nxs compared to PL. The efficacy of Nxs, shown also in improving premenstrual pain, and its good tolerability, support the use of this drug in the prophylactic therapy of MM. 
3	Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy for neuropathy at the elbow. Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy was performed in 66 elbows between 1966 and 1986 for compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. This study is an updated review that adds 36 cases to a previously published report on 30 cases. These elbows were graded preoperatively and postoperatively using McGowan's grading system. Eighty-three percent improved one or two grades, and 11% improved subjectively although they showed no objective improvement, 3% noted no change, and 3% were subjectively worse. One early case sustained damage to the ulnar collateral ligament with resultant instability. No other complications occurred. The best results were seen in the Grade I and II lesions, whereas those with Grade III lesions were the least predictable. The procedure is technically uncomplicated with minimal morbidity and reliable results. 
3	Circulatory and thermal adjustments to prolonged exercise in paraplegic women. The circulatory and thermal responses to 90 min of wheelchair ergometer exercise were examined in five wheelchair dependent (WD) women with low level spinal dysfunction and five able-bodied (AB) women who served as a comparison group. Metabolic rate during exercise was 221 W for WD and 255 W for AB (P greater than 0.05). Oral temperature (Tor), mean skin temperature (Tsk), oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) were assessed periodically throughout the exercise period. Ambient conditions were 24-25 degrees C and 38-52% relative humidity. A significant group X time interaction was found for Tor (P less than 0.001) and Tsk (P less than 0.001). Tor of the WD group steadily increased during the exercise, whereas the AB group showed a stable Tor. Tsk of WD increased rapidly during the first 5-10 min of exercise and continued to rise at a slower rate throughout the exercise. In contrast, Tsk of AB rose to a peak during the first 10 min and then showed a decreasing trend. VO2 and HR remained stable in both groups throughout the exercise period. Following an initial increase in Qc from minute 10 to minute 20 in both groups, values for WD continually decreased until Qc at 80 min was 14% lower than at 10 min. The findings suggest that the WD women had greater thermoregulatory strain than the AB women as indicated by a higher Tor and Tsk and by an inability to maintain Qc due to paralysis of the lower limbs and perhaps an increase in cutaneous blood volume. 
1	Complications associated with limb salvage for extremity sarcomas and their management. A retrospective clinical review of 100 consecutive patients with extremity sarcomas managed by limb salvage operations was performed to evaluate local tumor control and morbidity. The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months. Overall survival was 86%. There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients. Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication. Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients. Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb. Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity. 
4	Application of time series analysis to circadian rhythms: effect of beta-adrenergic blockade upon heart rate and transient myocardial ischemia. Circadian variations of transient myocardial ischemia and heart rate have been identified, but the rhythms and their response to beta blockade have not been fully characterized. Time-series analysis, a mathematical technique to describe oscillatory activity occurring within a continuous data set was used, to address these issues. Nine men with coronary artery disease underwent 72 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during therapy with placebo or metoprolol. During administration of placebo, ischemic time and heart rate showed a primary peak with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours with a tight coupling between the 2 variables and a secondary peak with a periodicity of 5 to 8 hours. During metoprolol therapy, heart rate and ischemic variation were reduced and the 24-hour periodicity for heart rate only remained. The 24-hour periodicity for ischemia was eliminated, but the data with 5- to 8-hour periodicity became the major component of the signal. 
5	Repair of cartilage lesions using biological implants. A comparative histological and biomechanical study in goats. We report the experimental use of three different biological implants to restore articular surface defects: glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine meniscal xenograft, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine costal cartilage xenograft, and viable osteochondral allografts. The grafts were implanted in the knees of 19 goats who were allowed free-field activity and were studied for up to one year. The natural articular surfaces of meniscal fibrocartilage provided excellent articular surfaces at all times. Equally good articular surfaces were restored by host tissue growth covering costal cartilage grafts at six months, but by 12 months this surface had degenerated. The majority of the allografts survived and integrated with the host at six months, but many showed signs of failure at 12 months. Only three out of seven ungrafted defects healed completely at six months and the healed surfaces were degenerating at 12 months. 
4	Sequential gradient pneumatic compression enhances venous ulcer healing: a randomized trial. The treatment of venous ulcers has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The application of properly applied graduated compression bandages, the use of graduated compression stockings, and surgery have been shown to achieve healing. However, some ulcers persist despite appropriate management. A randomized study was undertaken to compare two regimens of treatment for such patients. Both regimens included ulcer debridement, cleaning, nonadherent dressing, and graduated compression stockings. In one regimen, sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for 4 hours each day. Only one of 24 patients in the control group had complete healing of all ulcers compared with 10 of 21 patients healed in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The median rate of ulcer healing in the control group was 2.1% area per week compared to 19.8% area per week in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The results indicate that sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression is beneficial in the treatment of venous ulcers. 
5	Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts. Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect. 
4	Management of renovascular disease. A surgical perspective. The role of surgical revascularization in the management of patients with renal artery disease has changed in recent years. This has occurred due to the advent of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as an effective method of treatment for certain patients, improved results of surgical revascularization in older patients with atherosclerosis, an enhanced appreciation of advanced atherosclerotic renal artery disease as a correctable cause of renal failure, and the development of more effective surgical techniques for patients with severe aortic atherosclerosis and branch renal artery disease. Surgical revascularization is currently the treatment of choice for patients with branch renal artery disease, ostial atherosclerotic renal artery disease, a renal artery aneurysm, and patients in whom renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been unsuccessful. Excellent clinical results continue to be achieved with surgical revascularization in properly selected patients. 
3	Measurement of progressive cerebral ventriculomegaly in infants after grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhages. To develop guidelines that might help predict prospectively which infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) would require intervention, we obtained serial cranial sonograms to measure the rate of growth of cerebral ventricular volumes in 48 preterm infants with and without IVH. The infants were divided into three groups: (1) those with no IVH (22 infants), (2) those with IVH with acute ventricular dilation (13 infants), and (3) those with IVH with progressive ventricular dilation requiring intervention (13 infants). The decision to intervene because of progressive ventricular dilation was based on clinical criteria and the subjective assessment of increasing ventricular size on weekly cranial sonograms. The rate of cerebral ventricular volume growth in infants with IVH who needed intervention was greater (4.2 +/- 3.3 ml/day) than that in infants without IVH (0.0 +/- 0.1 ml/day; p less than 0.001) and in infants with IVH and acute ventricular dilation (0.0 +/- 0.2 ml/day; p less than 0.001). Using these data, we generated guidelines for predicting prospectively which infants with IVH and ventricular dilation will need intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The guidelines were then confirmed prospectively in 10 infants. 
5	Nutrient modulation of inflammatory and immune function. The metabolic response to injury occurs after a diverse group of surgical injuries including major surgical intervention, shock, infection, and sources of inflammation such as pancreatitis. The response is mediated by the macroendocrine system, the autonomic nervous system, and the cell-cell communication system. The clinical manifestations include now well-described clinical, physiologic, and metabolic characteristics. The approach of aggressive source control, invasive circulatory resuscitation, and nutrition/metabolic support has been associated with an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. In those patients who do not respond to this approach, the disease process progresses to multiple organ failure syndrome with its associated high mortality. Altering the route of feeding, preventing single nutrient and generalized nutrient deficiency, and reducing nosocomial infections with selective gut decontamination have not significantly altered the course or outcome of the disease process in this latter group of patients with persistent hypermetabolism. The available data support the position that this persistent hypermetabolism represents abnormal metabolic regulation resulting in persistence of the inflammatory response with associated suppression of the immune defenses. A number of research approaches are being taken to understand and modulate this abnormal state of regulation. Because of the role of specific nutrients in these regulatory processes, beyond their role in classic nutrition support, nutrients such as arginine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and RNA are being evaluated for their ability to modulate inflammation and to improve immune function. Preliminary results are encouraging. 
1	Corporate-sponsored breast cancer screening at the work site: results of a statewide program. Mobile screening mammography was offered to 3,627 employees of a large corporation in Pennsylvania and Delaware. The examination was available to women employees or employee spouses aged 35 years and older. Women were charged $30 for a standard two-view examination. They also received health education materials on mammography and breast self-examination. The remaining costs of the program were underwritten by the corporation. During this program, 3,627 mammographic studies were performed; 63 biopsies were recommended. Fifty-seven biopsies were performed, and nine cancers were diagnosed. Costs of this program are presented in detail. The authors conclude that mobile screening programs at the work site provide an inexpensive, convenient alternative to more traditional screening programs. The inherent advantages of this program are the low cost, the relative ease with which the examination can be performed, and the positive role that corporate medical personnel assume in encouraging individual and group participation. 
2	Biliary lithotripsy: in vitro analysis of gallstone fragmentation for equivalent stone volumes. The relationship between gallstone fragmentation during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and gallstone volume is poorly understood. Clinical results of ESWL show that the highest stone-free rate at 6 months occurs with radiolucent single gallstones 20 mm or less in diameter. In an in vitro study, individual gallstones from cholecystectomy specimens were divided by size and composition into nine single- and nine multiple-stone groups; the stones were then paired on the basis of similar volume. ESWL was performed in a phantom and the size of the largest fragment was measured at 500, 1,000, and 1,500 shock waves. At 1,500 shock waves, sandlike particles were present in six of nine single stones versus two of nine multiple stone groups; the mean size of the largest fragment at 1,500 shock waves was 2.1 mm (single) and 4.4 mm (multiple) in diameter. When corrected for volume, the authors' data suggest that single stones are more easily broken into fragments smaller than 5 mm in diameter than multiple gallstones. The implication, especially when spark-gap technology is used, is that more shock wave energy (ie, an increased number of shock waves at a higher kilovoltage) will be necessary to achieve the same results when treating patients with multiple stones versus a single gallstone with a similar stone volume. 
1	Male breast cancer. Male breast cancer is uncommon but important. The diagnosis is easily made by breast biopsy, and patients are presenting earlier in the course of the disease than in the past. Despite this, patients are often first seen with tumors that have metastasized to the axillary nodes, which markedly decreases the survival rate. Therapy of localized disease includes simple excision, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy, but there is no consensus for which operation is appropriate. Radiation therapy should be strongly considered in patients with metastases to the axillary nodes, but the role of adjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy is unclear. For treatment of disseminated disease, tamoxifen seems to be replacing orchiectomy. The favorable response rate, especially in patients with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, the lack of side effects, and the high level of patient acceptability make it an attractive therapeutic choice. 
4	New developments in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Since the last revision of the American Heart Association's guidelines in 1985, several new developments of clinical importance have occurred in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These include enhanced access to and earlier use of defibrillation, the use of high-dose epinephrine when standard doses fail, the assessment of resuscitative efforts with end-tidal CO2 monitoring and the addition of two new drugs, amiodarone (for refractory ventricular fibrillation) and adenosine (for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). Time will determine the ultimate role of these advancements in the management of cardiac arrest. 
5	Genetics and biology of human ovarian teratomas. II. Molecular analysis of origin of nondisjunction and gene-centromere mapping of chromosome I markers. Chromosomal heteromorphisms and DNA polymorphisms have been utilized to identify the mechanisms that lead to formation of human ovarian teratomas and to construct a gene-centromere map of chromosome 1 by using those teratomas that arise by meiotic nondisjunction. Of 61 genetically informative ovarian teratomas, 21.3% arose by nondisjunction at meiosis I, and 39.3% arose by meiosis II nondisjunction. Eight polymorphic marker loci on chromosome 1p and one marker on 1q were used to estimate a gene-centromere map. The results show clear linkage of the most proximal 1p marker (NRAS) and the most proximal 1q marker (D1S61) to the centromere at a distance of 14 cM and 20 cM, respectively. Estimated gene-centromere distances suggest that, while recombination occurs normally in ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis II errors, ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis I nondisjunction have altered patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the estimated map demonstrates clear evidence of chiasma interference. Our results suggest that ovarian teratomas can provide a rapid method for mapping genes relative to the centromere. 
5	Silent ischemia after coronary angioplasty: evaluation of restenosis and extent of ischemia in asymptomatic patients by tomographic thallium-201 exercise imaging and comparison with symptomatic patients. One hundred sixteen patients were evaluated to determine the ability of single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium-201 exercise and redistribution imaging to detect silent ischemia secondary to restenosis in asymptomatic patients after single and multiple vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the findings were compared with SPECT imaging detection of restenosis in symptomatic patients. The value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and the amount of ischemic myocardium in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were determined. Forty-one patients were asymptomatic after angioplasty; 77% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Seventy-five patients had chest pain after angioplasty; 99% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Restenosis occurred in 61% of asymptomatic and 59% of symptomatic patients and in 46% of the vessels in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of restenosis by SPECT in individual patients were 96%, 75% and 88% versus 91%, 77% and 85%, respectively, in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic groups (p = NS). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for restenosis detection in individual vessels were 90%, 89% and 89% versus 84%, 77% and 84%, respectively, in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups (p = NS), with similar results for the three major arteries. Sensitivity and accuracy of exercise ECG were significantly less than those of SPECT imaging for the patients with silent (40% and 44%) and symptomatic (59% and 64%) ischemia (p less than 0.001). Restenosis of vessels in the patients with silent and symptomatic ischemia was associated with an equal amount and degree of severity of ischemic myocardium in the two groups. 
1	The relationship of ABH(O) blood group antigen expression in intraepithelial dysplastic lesions to clinicopathologic properties of associated transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Paraffin-embedded, giant-step sections of 13 bladders with transitional cell carcinomas were stained with monoclonal anti-A or anti-B antibodies to investigate whether intraepithelial dysplastic lesions are related to obvious tumors. Normal and/or hyperplastic lesions were retained in only eight bladders; severe dysplasia and/or carcinoma in situ were found in all bladders except two. AB-antigen expression was retained in intraepithelial lesions of bladders with invasive carcinoma. Most intraepithelial lesions were AB-antigen negative in bladders with frequently recurrent tumors. In bladders with initially multiple tumors, AB-antigen expression was negative in almost one half of the intraepithelial lesions. Therefore, it appears likely that most multiple or recurrent bladder carcinomas arise from dysplastic cells in intraepithelial lesions which have acquired malignant potential; initially invasive tumors quickly develop from a limited lesion acquiring a high malignant potential without changes of cell phenotype in most intraepithelial lesions. 
4	Thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. The 1980s has been a critical decade for the management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) because of the concentration in a very short time span of innovative results produced by a new generation of trials, in which thrombolysis has been the preeminent topic. The message coming from the results in the more than 50,000 patients included in the five key trials is simple and clear: thrombolysis, of any type, is the cornerstone of acute treatment of MI, and it works well to produce a very favorable epidemiologic picture. In the GISSI-2 trial, the nationwide adoption of a package of recommended treatments centered on thrombolysis for the overall population of patients with an acute MI has produced a relevant modification of the natural history of the disease, reducing the in-hospital mortality by about 40% in few years (from 13% to 8.8%). In particular, in the great majority of cases (patients aged less than 70 years in Killip class I with a first acute MI), the mortality has gone down to 3%, making a further reduction very hard to obtain with new drugs or strategies. In this context, we will discuss the concept of the relevance for clinical practice of obtaining even greater patency rates with new thrombolytic agents (hopefully more efficient and safe) or with new combinations of traditional agents. 
3	Topographic comparative study of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in 34 children with tuberous sclerosis. A series of 34 children with confirmed tuberous sclerosis (TS) were studied prospectively by both EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ages ranging from 5 months to 18 years. Size and topography of the cortical tubers were analyzed on axial and coronal views, in T2 sequences, and the large tubers greater than 10 mm were studied. In addition, EEG follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients (76%) had both MRI large cortical tubers and EEG foci, 3 had normal EEG, 2 had normal MRI, and the remaining 3 had only small tubers. The number of large tubers was significantly related to EEG foci. A topographic MRI/EEG correspondence was observed for at least one tuber in 25 of the 26 patients, and correspondence was complete in 10 patients. Large cortical tubers without corresponding EEG foci were observed in 11 patients; these tubers mainly involved the frontal regions and were found before the patients were 2 years old. EEG foci without corresponding tubers were observed in 4 patients. In addition, secondary bilateral synchrony was preferentially observed in patients with frontal lesions and after the age of 2 years. These data confirm that the cortical tubers are epileptogenic and that their expression may be influenced by regional cortical maturation. 
1	Gastric juice ascorbic acid: effects of disease and implications for gastric carcinogenesis. N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are strongly implicated in the causation of cancer of the stomach and it has been suggested that ascorbic acid might reduce the risk of gastric cancer by preventing their formation within gastric juice. However, until recently there have been no measurements of gastric juice ascorbic acid concentrations. We have measured both gastric juice ascorbic and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid). Our findings suggest that ascorbic acid is secreted into the gastric lumen so that gastric juice concentrations are often greater than those in plasma. Gastric pathology affects this secretion, leading to values in gastric juice that are lower than plasma levels. Stimulation of gastric secretion does not raise vitamin C concentrations in individuals whose values are initially low. The role of ascorbic acid in preventing formation of NOC and protecting against gastric cancer is discussed in the light of these findings. 
4	Risk factors for carotid artery stenosis: an epidemiological study of men aged 69 years. Four hundred and seventy-eight men born in 1914 and residing in the city of Malmo, Sweden, underwent ultrasonic Doppler examination of the carotid arteries in 1982/83. The known risk factors for vascular disease--blood pressure, lipids, glucose, hematocrit, alcohol consumption and Body Mass Index were also measured. A moderate stenosis (diameter reduction 30-59%) of the internal carotid artery was found in 95 men (20%); 15 men (3%) had a greater than or equal to 60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery, while 7 (1.5%) had complete unilateral occlusion. Smoking was found to be significantly related to severe carotid artery disease. There was also a significant correlation between maximum flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and triglycerides. Those quitting smoking before the age of 50 had the same incidence of internal carotid artery disease as non-smokers, while those quitting later in life had a slightly higher incidence than life-long smokers. 
5	Follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of native coarctation in neonates and infants. The purpose of this study is to present intermediate-term results of balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctation in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. During a 60-month-period that ended in January 1990, 19 infants ages 3 days to 12 months (median, 2.5 months), underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 39 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 11 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm to 4.7 +/- 1.0 mm. None required immediate surgical intervention. Thirteen of the 19 (68%) had severe associated cardiac defects. There was one death (5%) 2 days after balloon angioplasty, and it was related to associated cardiac defect. One infant was lost to follow-up. It is too soon to restudy one infant. The remaining 16 infants had clinical (36 +/- 18 months) and catheterization (12 +/- 4 months) follow-up data. The residual coarctation gradient (22 +/- 15 mm Hg) and coarcted segment size (4.4 +/- 1.6 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.01) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values. Five of the 16 (31%) infants (four were neonates at the time of balloon angioplasty) had evidence for recoarctation (defined as gradient greater than 20 mm Hg) and underwent surgical resection (two) or repeat balloon angioplasty (three), all with success. None developed aneurysms. 
5	Hyponatremia-induced inhibition of magnocellular neurons causes stressor-selective impairment of stimulated adrenocorticotropin secretion in rats. Chronically hyponatremic rats were subjected to various stressors in order to evaluate the possible contribution of magnocellular neurons to the regulation of ACTH secretion, since such rats have markedly inhibited secretion and synthesis of magnocellular arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT). Stress caused by a novel environment or by insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in moderate increases in plasma ACTH, which were of similar magnitude in both hyponatremic and normonatremic rats, and these stressors caused no increase in plasma AVP and OT levels in either group of rats. However, when exposed to ether, hyponatremic rats exhibited a significantly blunted ACTH response compared to normonatremic controls (331 +/- 49 vs. 740 +/- 124 pg/ml; P less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma AVP levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. Intravenous infusion of 2 M NaCl also caused an ACTH release in hyponatremic rats that was significantly smaller than that in their normonatremic counterparts (228 +/- 52 vs. 479 +/- 85 pg/ml; P less than 0.05, respectively), and in this case both plasma AVP and OT levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. However, hyponatremic rats exhibited greatly increased plasma ACTH levels 2 and 96 h after adrenalectomy (ADX), which were statistically equivalent to the increases in ACTH levels in normonatremic rats after ADX. Seven days after ADX parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus showed strongly increased CRF-41 and AVP-neurophysin, but not OT-neurophysin, immunoreactivities in both normonatremic and hyponatremic rats. These results show that parvocellular CRF-41/AVP-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are not inhibited by chronic hyponatremia, in contrast to magnocellular neurons, and suggest that ACTH secretion induced by ether or hypertonic saline, but not by novel environment or insulin-induced hypoglycemia, is partially mediated by magnocellular AVP and/or OT. 
5	Referred pain of muscular origin resembling endodontic involvement. Case report. Referred pain is common in the orofacial region and can cause considerable difficulties in diagnosis. Referred pain is defined as pain that is referred to a part of the body other than the site of origin, and as a result, severe pain may arise without an associated causative lesion. A muscular trigger point that resembled a tooth with endodontic involvement is discussed. 
5	Decreased ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness are not reversed by naloxone in Lhasa residents with chronic mountain sickness. Persons with chronic mountain sickness (CMS) hypoventilate and are more hypoxemic than normal individuals, but the cause of the hypoventilation is unclear. Studies of 14 patients with CMS and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects residing in Lhasa, Tibet, China (3,658 m) were conducted to test the hypothesis that hypoventilation, blunted hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness (HVR), and hypoxic ventilatory depression of CMS were due to increased endogenous opioid production. Patients with CMS compared with control subjects exhibited hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure [PETCO2] = 36.6 +/- 1.0 versus 31.5 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), lower tidal volume (VT = 0.54 +/- 0.02 versus 0.61 +/- 0.02 ml BTPS, p less than 0.05), blunted HVR (shape parameter A = 17 +/- 8 versus 114 +/- 22 mm Hg/L BTPS/min, p less than 0.05), and a depressant effect of ambient hypoxia on ventilation (delta PETCO2 with acute hyperoxia = -3.5 +/- 0.5 versus -1.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s to vital capacity ratios (FEV1/VC) and a higher proportion of cigarette smokers in the group of patients with CMS compared with control subjects suggested that at least some patients with CMS had mild airway obstructive lung disease. Naloxone infusion (0.14 mg/kg) to six patients with CMS did not change resting VT, PETCO2, HVR, or SaO2. 
1	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein secretion by breast carcinoma cell lines: correlation with estrogen receptor status. Breast tumor cell lines have been shown to secrete several distinct polypeptide growth factors, although conflicting results exist for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In contrast a limited number of breast tumor cell lines have definitely been shown to secrete the high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modify IGF actions. To characterize the types of IGFBPs that are secreted by breast tumor cell lines, conditioned medium was collected from seven separate tumor cell lines, three of which were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and four of which were ER positive. All three of the ER negative cell lines, MDA-231, MDA-330, and HS578T, secreted binding proteins of 49,000 and 43,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) as well as 29,000 (IGFBP-1) and 24,000 Mr. In contrast, all four ER positive cell lines secreted 34,000 (IGFBP-2) or 24,000 Mr forms, and none secreted the 49,000 and 43,000 or 29,000 Mr forms. BT-20, a cell line that is positive for ER messenger RNA (mRNA) but negative for ER protein, secreted predominantly a 34,000 Mr protein. The amount of total IGFBP activity released in 24 h ranged between 0.4 and 5.6 nM equivalents of IGFBP-1, and there was no significant difference between the ER positive and negative cell lines. The MCF-7 cells that produced predominantly 34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms showed a 1.8-fold increase in IGFBP secretion after estrogen stimulation. Immunoblotting and a specific RIA for IGFBP-1 showed that only the ER negative lines MDA-330, MDA-231, and HS578T secreted this form. Northern blotting analysis for the mRNA encoding this protein showed that both MDA-330 and MDA-231 contained a single 1.6 kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with an IGFBP-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Immunoblotting analysis of the other cell lines showed that only the 34,000 Mr form secreted by the ER positive cell lines reacted with IGFBP-2 antisera. Exposure of the conditioned media from the three ER negative cell lines to N-glycanase revealed that the 49,000 and 43,000 Mr forms of IGFBP were glycosylated and therefore probably represent IGFBP-3. We conclude that ER negative cell lines secrete three forms of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and a 24,000 Mr form. In contrast, the ER positive cell lines secrete predominantly IGFBP-2 and the 24,000 Mr form but do not secrete IGFBP-3 or 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	Biobehavioral factors in Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Review and examination. The behavioral studies component of the multicenter Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) was designed to examine the relation of biobehavioral factors and frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy, and disease end points in a study population that had experienced recent myocardial infarction and significant ventricular ectopy. Biobehavioral factors included both psychosocial (depression, anxiety, social support, type A behavior, mood, defensiveness, and anger expressiveness) and psychophysiological (heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to a videogame stressor) variables. Data were collected at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Of the 502 patients enrolled in CAPS, 353 participated in the behavioral studies component. At baseline, assessments of psychosocial variables revealed the CAPS study population to be generally similar to other heart disease populations, and no relation between these variables and psychophysiological reactivity or arrhythmias was found. At follow-up among patients assigned to the placebo condition, biobehavioral variables were not related to levels of VPCs or VPC suppression. Cox regression analyses revealed that type B behavior, depression, and reduced heart rate reactivity were associated with increased clinical events, even after controlling for baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, use of beta-blockers, use of digitalis, Q wave of qualifying myocardial infarction, and presence of unsustained ventricular tachycardia on baseline electrocardiogram. It is hypothesized that the relation among reduced heart rate reactivity, depression, and clinical events is mediated by diminished cardiac vagal tone. 
4	Acute pulmonary oedema following administration of ornithine-8-vasopressin. We report the case of a patient who developed acute pulmonary oedema following a short and uneventful surgical procedure. Among the differential diagnoses, the role of ornithine-8-vasopressin is emphasized. 
5	Evaluation of current extrication orthoses in immobilization of the unstable cervical spine. An experiment was designed to evaluate the comparative stabilizing efficacy of several widely used semi-rigid orthoses applied to unstable fresh cadaver cervical spines subject to load. Cadaver specimens were surgically destabilized at the C4-5 segment. Lateral radiographs of the destabilized spine were obtained before and after collar placement and after the application of a 5-pound flexion force. Data analysis employing a one-way analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference in the Necloc's, Philadelphia Collar's, or the Stifneck's ability to stabilize the cervical spine against a deforming flexion force (P greater than 0.05). They all provide translational stability while allowing angular changes to occur with application of the flexion force. The Philadelphia Collar Halo System is statistically superior to all three of the aforementioned collars in prevention of both translation and sagittal rotation (P less than 0.05). 
4	Primary repair for complete atrioventricular canal: recommendation for early primary repair. Forty patients with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) underwent primary repair at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in Fukuoka, Japan, between August 1, 1981 and July 31, 1989. The age at repair ranged from 2 months to 6 years (mean 19 months); weight ranged from 2.3 to 22 kg. The surgical mortality was 2.5%. Justification for early primary repair was examined. Eleven patients underwent repair before 6 months of age (Group 1), 12 patients, between 7 and 11 months of age (Group 2), and 17 patients, after 12 months of age (Group 3). Degenerative changes in the atrioventricular valve increased significantly as age at repair increased (p less than 0.05 Group 1 versus Group 3). The incidence of residual mitral regurgitation tended to increase in the order of Group 1, 2 and 3, though the degree ranged from trivial to mild. Study of the left atrium/aorta ratio by echocardiography revealed that stable values of around 1.1 in Groups 1 and 2 and around 1.3 in Group 3 continued during the follow-up period of 3 years. Assessment of the diameter of the repaired mitral valve in the mean interval of 26 months in groups 1 and 2 revealed normal growth of the mitral valve annulus. The angle between the repaired mitral valve and ventricular septum, which can be affected by the growth of the ventricular septum, converged to normal range in the mean interval of 26 months. Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in Groups 2 and 3 was higher at 4.4 +/- 2.3 and 6.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, than in Group 1 at 3.3 +/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01 versus Group 3). 
2	Selective intestinal decontamination prevents spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In a prospective randomized study, selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin was performed during hospitalization in 32 cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid total protein levels. The incidence of infections was compared with that in a control group of 31 nontreated cirrhotic patients of similar characteristics. We found a significantly lower incidence of infections [1/32 (3.1%) vs. 13/31 (41.9%); P less than 0.005] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [0/32 (0%) vs. 7/31 (22.5%); P less than 0.05] in patients receiving norfloxacin. The lower incidence of extraperitoneal infections [1/32 (3.1%) vs. 7/31 (22.5%); P = 0.052] in the treated group did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of infections [1/28 (3.6%) vs. 9/22 (40.9%); P less than 0.01] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [0/28 (0%) vs. 5/22 (22.7%); P less than 0.05] in cirrhotic patients admitted because of ascites was also significantly lower in the treated group. The decrease in the rate of mortality observed in the group undergoing selective intestinal decontamination did not reach statistical significance. These data show that selective intestinal decontamination is useful to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and extraperitoneal infections in hospitalized cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid total protein levels. 
5	Intestinal ischemia complicating abdominal aortic surgery. A 9-year experience with 2137 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic reconstruction was reviewed to determine both the incidence of intestinal ischemia and the clinical, anatomic, and technical factors associated with this complication of aortic surgery. A total of 24 (1.1%) patients had overt intestinal ischemia, documented by reoperation or endoscopic findings. Of these, colon ischemia occurred in 19 (0.9%) and small bowel ischemia developed in 5 (0.2%) patients. The incidence after elective operation for aneurysmal or occlusive disease did not differ, but patients with ruptured aneurysms and those undergoing reoperative procedures for total graft replacement were at higher risk. Preoperative angiography was most helpful in ascertaining risk. Ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery was the most common (74%) feature in patients with colon ischemia. With preexisting inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, impairment of collateral circulation was attributable to superior mesenteric artery disease, dissection or retractor injury, prior colon resection, or exclusion of hypogastric perfusion. Bloody diarrhea was the most frequent postoperative symptom and colonoscopy the most reliable means of diagnosis. One half of patients with colon ischemia required resection after late recognition of perforation. All cases of small bowel ischemia were related to superior mesenteric artery disease or injury or use of suprarenal clamping. The overall mortality rate was 25% but rose to 50% if bowel resection was required. Intestinal ischemia remains an infrequent but serious complication of aortic surgery. Despite a multifactorial cause, identification of patients at increased risk can lead to operative strategies to reduce its occurrence. 
1	Simultaneous presentation of adenocarcinoma of prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of bladder. Simultaneous presentation of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and adenocarcinoma of the prostate is not uncommon. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed as having simultaneous or concurrent presentation of prostate and bladder carcinomas between January 1970 and July 1986. The overall five-year survival was 40 percent, with patients presenting with prostate cancer doing better (50%) than those with bladder cancer (32%). Retrospective review of these cases suggests that primary therapy should be directed to the most advanced cancer. Incidental prostate cancer may be "cured" with a cystoprostatectomy and, when indicated, radiation therapy added postoperatively for the bladder cancer. Eleven patients presented with Stage A prostate cancer: 10 of the 11 were treated for their bladder cancer. Treatment was usually radical cystoprostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation. None died of prostate cancer. Patients presenting with advanced stage prostate cancer have had recurrence or have died of the cancer. 
5	Acute appendicitis in the pregnant patient. Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical problem in pregnancy requiring emergent intervention. To establish a contemporary patient profile and formulate an effective management strategy, a retrospective review was conducted of 84 pregnant patients who underwent laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Gestational stage at presentation included the first trimester in 27 patients (32%), the second trimester in 37 patients (44%), the third trimester in 13 patients (16%), and the puerperium in 7 patients (8%). Fifty-four patients (64%) had pathologically proven acute appendicitis; the incidence did not vary by trimester. Other intra-abdominal conditions were detected in 15 patients (18%). There were no significant differences between patients with positive and negative laparotomies (or among trimesters) regarding frequency of presenting symptoms and signs or laboratory results. Operation occurred within 24 hours of symptom onset in 19 of 54 (35%) instances of proven acute appendicitis. Perforation occurred in 23 of 54 patients (43%), all of whom had symptoms exceeding 24 hours (p less than 0.0005). Five instances of perinatal death and one case of extreme perinatal morbidity were associated with negative laparotomies; only one of these was attributed to operation itself. No adverse long-term maternal morbidity or mortality occurred. Wound infection developed in seven cases of acute appendicitis (six perforated) and two negative explorations. We conclude that (1) gestational physiologic changes obscure the accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis; (2) the natural history of acute appendicitis is not affected by trimester of presentation; and (3) adverse sequelae of acute appendicitis are obviated by prompt operative exploration and prevention of appendiceal perforation. 
2	Preoperative stabilisation in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Between January 1983 and November 1986, 26 newborn infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were treated by early operation at a mean of 7 hours of age. A further 23 infants admitted between December 1986 and December 1989 were stabilised for a mean period of 40 hours before operation. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Delayed operation is not detrimental to infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. 
1	Clinicopathological experience with pineocytomas: report of five surgically treated cases. The clinicopathological experience associated with five cases of pineocytoma is presented. All patients were treated by surgical removal without postoperative radiotherapy. In three individuals, 2000 cGy was administered to the tumor as a presurgical diagnostic test, with no evidence of response. All cases demonstrated histological features of pineocytoma, according to the criteria of Borit et al., and of the so-called "pineocytoma with neuronal differentiation," according to the criteria of Rubinstein. The experience obtained from the present series reveals that these tumors can occur in the initial decades of life, that a cystic appearance and the presence of calcifications are distinctive features of their radiological evaluation, and that they have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even when the histological data indicate local invasion. The convenience of reserving the term "pineocytoma" for these tumors, and of including the so-called "pineocytomas without further differentiation" within the group of pineoblastomas, is suggested in order to achieve a practical clinicopathological assessment of parenchymatous pineal tumors. 
5	A huge intracranial xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa: case report. Xanthogranulomas of the dura presenting with clinical symptoms are rare. We report here a case of a huge dural xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa, which caused hemiparesis through marked displacement and stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. Although such tumors usually arise in association with histiocytosis X or familial hyperlipoproteinemia, the present case was not associated with these diseases. 
5	Histology of the lens in the Weill-Marchesani syndrome. The Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare systemic connective tissue disease characterised by small stature, brachydactyly, ectopia lentis, and spherophakia. Three siblings with typical manifestations of this syndrome were reported. The ophthalmological findings in all these cases were spherophakia, severe myopia, a shallow anterior chamber, and narrow angle glaucoma. Two cases underwent laser iridotomy and drug treatment. In the third case the lens was removed from the eye because of injury, and this lens was examined by light and electron microscopy. 
5	Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. 
4	Comparison of lisinopril versus atenolol for mild to moderate essential hypertension. The antihypertensive effects and safety profiles of lisinopril (10 to 40 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 144 patients with essential hypertension. After 8 weeks of therapy, seated blood pressure (BP) decreased by 26/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. Lisinopril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in sitting systolic BP than did atenolol. Standing BP decreased by 25/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug. Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group. Both drugs were well-tolerated and are therefore suitable for first-line therapy in essential hypertension. 
5	Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae. 
4	Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28. 
5	Multimodality evoked potential testing in acute mild closed head injury. Multimodality evoked potential (MEP) testing, including brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials, have been reported to be useful in predicting outcome in severe closed head injury. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials have been demonstrated to be abnormal in 10% to 40% of acute mild head injury. A prospective study of 18 patients with mild closed head injury was undertaken to determine the usefulness of MEP screening within two weeks of the acute event. Long latency event-related potentials (P300s), in response to auditory stimuli with an oddball paradigm, were included in the screening. The subjects had several symptoms consistent with the postconcussive syndrome at the time of the evoked potential testing. Only one patient had an abnormal evoked potential response (greater than three standard deviations from the mean) from all the testing done. The standard methods of MEP testing were insensitive to quantifying the possible physiologic changes that are associated with memory deficits, lethargy, and emotional irritability after mild closed head injury. 
4	Impact of nonoperative therapy on the clinical management of peripheral arterial disease. Nonoperative therapy includes conservative noninterventional modalities and the endovascular interventional modalities of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and a variety of laser systems and atherectomy devices. The role and impact of all nonoperative treatments are considered in the perspectives of the natural history of lower-extremity arteriosclerosis and its present surgical (operative) treatment. Nonoperative treatments may replace and/or facilitate surgical treatment in operative candidates. Nonoperative methods may also justify treatment in patients who cannot or should not be subjected to surgery. Facts and opinions relating to these uses of nonoperative treatments are presented, and the qualifications and credentialing of individuals who should be treating patients with lower-extremity ischemia resulting from peripheral arteriosclerosis are discussed. 
1	Gene amplification in human lung cancer. The myc family genes and other proto-oncogenes and growth factor genes. The development of human lung cancer may require multiple genetic deletions affecting a number of chromosomes, e.g., 1, 3, 11, 13, and 17. These genetic aberrations may induce the activation of proto-oncogenes (c-jun, ras, c-raf1) and the loss of tumor suppressor genes (p53). Some of the activated proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are more selectively expressed or absent in small-cell lung cancer (L-myc, c-myb, c-scr, Rb gene) or non-small-cell lung cancer (c-erbB-2, c-sis, c-fes). These genes may thus be of importance for selection of differentiation pathway. The c-myc oncogene is frequently amplified in small-cell lung cancer cell lines in a much higher frequency than in vivo. This indicates that c-myc seems to be related to tumor progression and a relatively late event in the lung cancer development. The uncontrolled production of multiple growth factors has been identified in human lung cancer cell lines. These factors can promote and inhibit the proliferation via paracrine and autocrine loops via specific receptors. The products from some of the activated proto-oncogenes (c-sis, c-erbB-2) are sequences homologous to a certain growth factor (PDGF) and a receptor (EGF) identified in lung cancer. The production and action of these growth factors may be of major importance for further activation of proto-oncogenes via intracellular signal transduction and specific oncogenic activation leading to further tumor progression. 
4	Frequency and severity of mitral regurgitation one year after balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was evaluated by Doppler echocardiography in 59 patients with mitral stenosis before, immediately after and 1 year after balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV). The severity of MR was graded on a scale from 1+ to 4+. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables were analyzed to study the potential factor(s) that might predict the long-term persistence of MR. Echocardiographic variables were mitral valve thickness and motion, subvalvular change, left atrial dimension, commissural calcification and effective balloon/mitral anular diameters. Hemodynamic variables were mitral pressure gradient, pulmonary arterial pressure, ejection fraction, mitral valve area index, age, gender and cardiac rhythm. Mitral valve area index increased from 0.9 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.8 cm2/m2 immediately after BMW, and to 1.4 +/- 0.3 cm2/m2 at 1 year follow-up (p less than 0.01). Immediately after BMV, MR grading did not change in 30 patients (51%), increased by 1+ in 23 patients (39%), by 2+ in 2 patients (3.3%) and by 3+ in 2 patients (3.3%), and decreased by 1+ in 2 others. At 1-year follow-up, only 1 patient with severe MR required valve replacement. Fifty-one patients (88%) had no change in the extent of MR (less than or equal to 1+) and 6 patients (10%) had a 1-grade decrease in their MR; only 1 patient had a 1-grade increase in MR. No clinical or hemodynamic variables or morphologic characteristics of the mitral valve could predict the development of significant MR after BMV. It is concluded that an increment in MR severity less than or equal to 2+ is frequently seen after BMV. 
1	A diagnostic expert system for colonic lesions. The diagnostic expert system for colonic lesions (DESCL) was designed to discriminate colonic adenoma and adenocarcinoma from normal colonic tissue. Although it was originally developed for use in conjunction with a machine vision analytic system, the DESCL has evolved into a teaching tool and a model for conceptual machine learning. The expert system is table driven and consists of a shell and a knowledge base. The latter comprises a series of architectural and cytologic observations and a quantitative estimate of diagnostic importance relating these observations to diagnostic outcome. In a validation study of 100 colonic lesions, the expert system achieved a success rate of 98%. It has the flexibility to allow individual pathologists to "customize" the knowledge base to suit their diagnostic criteria. 
3	Ocular manifestations of onchocerciasis in a rain forest area of west Africa. The epidemiology and natural history of onchocerciasis and its ocular complications in rain forest areas are poorly understood. The present study was conducted on a rubber plantation in a hyperendemic area in the rain forest of Liberia, West Africa, where 800 persons were examined. The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease. 
2	Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. 
4	A composite driving system for LVAS and IABP: practical and effective driving and weaning. We have devised a new method, termed alternate synchronous driving (ASD), to wean patients from a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) to a pressure assist intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). We have built a new drive unit, VCT200, to apply ASD easily and automatically. After IABP insertion in the final weaning stage, this method drives the LVAS and IABP alternately, with electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronization. The pumping ratio of IABP increases while that of LVAS decreases according to recovery of natural heart function. In in vitro studies, ASD was effective when bypass flow (BF) was less than 50% of total flow (TF) (TF:BF + cardiac output [CO]), and its advantages increased under lower BF conditions. Mean aortic pressure (mAP) and CO increased 10 mmHg and 15%, respectively, with this method (IABP:LVAS = 1:1) when BF was 30% of TF. During in vivo studies, mAP increased 75.7 +/- 6.7 mmHg to 80.1 +/- 3.6 mmHg (p less than 0.001), and the CO increased from 3.1 +/- 0.5 L/min to 3.3 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.001), while the endocardial viability ratio (DPTI/TTI) increased 20-30%. This method was used in a 62-year-old man in which LVAS was applied after ventricular aneurysmectomy, BF was reduced from 2.2 L/min to 1.1 L/min by using ASD without any change in systemic perfusion. This reduction of BF could not be achieved with LVAS alone. From these data, this system could wean patients from LVAS and then switch to IABP smoothly, easily, and automatically, without hemodynamic instability. 
1	Pathological classification and follow-up of prostatic lesions initially diagnosed as "suspicious of malignancy". Sections from a series of prostatic specimens (n = 44) in which the initial diagnosis implied a suspicion of malignancy were reviewed and the patients followed up (group 1). The aim was to categorise the morphological appearances according to current criteria and to determine the natural history of any pre-malignant lesions within this group. A "control" series of patients (n = 40) in whom the primary diagnosis was benign were also reviewed and their course followed (group 2). The heterogeneity of the abnormalities in group 1 was striking. Of the 44 cases, pre-malignant lesions were seen in 8, microinvasive adenocarcinoma in 11 and lesions not now considered pre-malignant in the remaining 25. None of the 8 patients with pre-malignant lesions developed clinical evidence of carcinoma over a follow-up period of 8 to 12 years. In contrast, 3 of the 11 diagnosed on review as having microscopic invasive adenocarcinoma developed clinically evident tumour within 5 years of surgery. Of the 25 patients whose prostatic lesions were considered benign, 2 developed carcinoma 12 and 13 years after surgery. Only 1 of the 40 patients in group 2 had a pre-malignant lesion and he did not develop tumour within 10 years. However, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed incidentally in 1 patient 3 years after surgery. It was concluded that there is a need to standardise interpretation and reporting of pre-malignant lesions and microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma in the prostate. The limited results on the course of pre-malignant lesions diagnosed incidentally in patients over 60 years of age do not indicate that follow-up would have prompted the early diagnosis of invasive disease. 
4	Long-term function of persons with atherosclerotic bilateral below-knee amputation living in the inner city. Long-term function of 24 elderly persons with atherosclerotic bilateral below-knee amputation living in an inner city for at least six months after the second amputation, was determined. Twenty-one (87.6%) subjects were living at home; three were living in nursing homes. Fourteen (70%) of 20 subjects who received bilateral prostheses were ambulators. At interview, the mean age was 75.2 years; 4.87 years was the mean time since the second amputation. Ten (50%) subjects remained ambulatory. Among the other ten who received prosthesis, loss of ambulation occurred mostly due to medical factors, at an average of 3.47 years after the second amputation. Those no longer ambulatory were older and "sicker," and the interval between amputations was shorter. Fifteen (62.5%) subjects were independent in dressing, 14 (58.4%) in toileting, and only nine (33.3%) in bathing. All but one subject required housekeeping assistance. The anticipated effect on function of environmental and socioeconomic factors could not be demonstrated in this sample. Survival time and retention of ambulatory skills for an average of nine years after the second amputation in eight (33.3%) subjects who died before the end of the study was longer than previously described. The high rate of success in rehabilitation and in maintenance of ambulatory skills fully justifies intensive restorative efforts for this group of amputees. 
3	Comparative ophthalmologic studies on children and adults with craniopharyngiomas. The subjects of the study are 74 patients with craniopharyngiomas treated at the Clinic of Neurosurgery, Bulgarian Medical Academy, within the period 1960-1989. Fifty of the patients are children and 24 adults. The diagnosis of all patients is made on the base of clinical, X-ray and histological studies. The ophthalmologic state was studied in all patients, prior to operation, via routine methods. Reduced visual acuity was established in 69.6% of the children and 81.8% of the adults. The presence of congestive optic papilla was diagnosed in 22% of the children and 12.5% of the adults. Optic atrophy was established in 62.5% of the adults and 52% of the children. Various defects in the visual field were established in 67.7% of the children and 81.8% of the adults with the predomination of bitemporal defects. The use of highly informative conventional and modern X-ray methods is recommended in all patients suspected of compression of the visual pathways. 
1	Papillary endothelial hyperplasia in the thyroid following fine-needle aspiration. A 74-year-old woman was found to have exuberant papillary endothelial hyperplasia within her thyroid gland subsequent to multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of a Hurthle cell neoplasm. To our knowledge, this histologic alteration in the thyroid has not been previously reported. We describe this unusual complication following fine-needle aspiration, and we delineate the clinicopathologic and differential diagnostic features. 
4	False aneurysm formation of the great arteries after arterial switch operation. An infant with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent a two-staged arterial switch operation, after which mediastinal infection occurred. Continuous irrigation with povidone-iodine solution was performed for 10 days. After that, the patient experienced life-threatening hemorrhage three times. At the time of the second hemorrhage, greater omental transfer was performed. On postoperative day 109, false aneurysm was recognized, having developed from both great arteries. Successful repair was performed on postoperative day 110. 
5	Urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections are a common infection for the primary care physician to see in the office. Epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and prophylaxis are discussed. Information regarding special patient populations, such as pregnant women and children, is also provided. 
2	Cross-national changes in the effects of peptic ulcer disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe and to analyze the changing effects of peptic ulcer disease over time. DESIGN: Variables relating to peptic ulcer disease from 1970-1986 were compared. The variables included rates of mortality, hospitalizations, operations, physician visits, and endoscopies, and the amount of disability-related loss of work and early retirement in six countries (Belgium, England and Wales, the Federal Republic of Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States). MEASUREMENTS: Nonparametric epidemiologic time-trend analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The historic, slow, declining trend in mortality and hospitalization rates continued. The rate of operations for peptic ulcer disease exhibited a large, one-time reduction, then returned to a parallel declining trend, but at a lower level. The rate of physician visits declined by 50%. The greatest changes were found in the rate of endoscopy use and in disability-related loss of work and early retirement, where increasing trends were quickly followed by decreasing trends. The elderly, especially women, generally did not share many of these benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of new interventions can be understood more fully by examining several variables in many countries over a long time. Contrary to expectations, the effects of the widespread use of histamine H2 antagonists have been more indirect (affecting work loss and disability retirement more) than direct (affecting high-cost medical service use and mortality less). 
5	Twelve-year comparison of a Bjork-Shiley mechanical heart valve with porcine bioprostheses BACKGROUND. Patients undergoing heart-valve replacement may receive a mechanical prosthesis, necessitating lifelong anticoagulant treatment, or a porcine bioprosthesis, which involves no absolute need for anticoagulants. METHODS. We carried out a randomized, prospective trial to compare the durability of the Bjork-Shiley mechanical prosthesis (spherical tilting-disk model) and the incidence of valve-related complications with those variables in the Hancock and the Carpentier-Edwards porcine prostheses. The mitral valve was replaced in 261 patients, the aortic valve in 211, and both in 61; the survivors have been followed up for a mean of 12 years. RESULTS. We found a trend toward improved actuarial survival after 12 years with the Bjork-Shiley prosthesis, but this trend was not statistically significant (group with Bjork-Shiley valve vs. group with porcine valve [mean +/- SE], 51.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 44.4 +/- 3.2 percent; P = 0.08). There was no significant difference in the actuarial incidence of reoperation after 5 years, but after 12 years significantly more patients with a porcine prosthesis had undergone reoperation (8.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 37.1 +/- 4.1 percent, P less than 0.001). An analysis combining death and reoperation as end points for an actuarial assessment of survival with the original prosthesis intact confirmed that the patients with Bjork-Shiley Shiley prostheses had improved survival (48.6 +/- 3.2 vs. 30.0 +/- 3.0 percent after 12 years, P less than 0.001). Bleeding requiring hospitalization or blood transfusion was significantly more frequent in the patients with Bjork-Shiley prostheses (18.6 +/- 3.2 vs. 7.1 +/- 2.3 percent after 12 years, P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference after 12 years in the actuarial occurrence of embolism (Bjork-Shiley vs. porcine, 21.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 26.4 +/- 3.5 percent) or endocarditis (3.7 +/- 1.4 vs 4.6 +/- 1.6 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Survival with an intact valve is better among patients with the Bjork-Shiley spherical tilting-disk prosthesis than among patients with porcine bioprostheses, but use of the Bjork-Shiley valve carries an attendant increased risk of bleeding associated with the need for anticoagulant treatment. 
3	Rett syndrome: findings suggesting axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities. We report the histopathologic findings of 3 sural nerve biopsies and 1 muscle biopsy from 3 patients with Rett syndrome. The 3 sural nerve biopsies demonstrated a few ultrastructural abnormalities, including the presence of many Pi-granules and mitochondrial changes in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells, occasional bands of Bungner and onion-bulb formations, and mitochondrial alterations in myelinated axons. Morphometric analysis disclosed reduction in the number of large myelinated fibers with normal densities in comparison to those of an age-matched normal control. Light microscopic examination of the biopsied muscle from a 6-year-old patient with Rett syndrome revealed the existence of many small, dark, angulated fibers with NADH-TR staining. Ultrastructural investigation of the muscle confirmed the presence of the dumbbell-shaped mitochondria. Peripheral nerve involvement and the possibility of mitochondrial abnormalities in Rett syndrome were suggested by the results. 
5	T-cell translocation gene 1 (Ttg-1) encodes a nuclear protein normally expressed in neural lineage cells. We previously identified and cloned T-cell translocation gene 1 (Ttg-1), a putative zinc finger protein, as a result of its deregulated expression in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (RPMI 8402) with a t(11;14)(p15;q11). We have now characterized its genomic organization and identified the major transcriptional start site to lie within an initiator-like motif. Ttg-1 is normally expressed in mouse brain and not in thymus. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, also expresses Ttg-1. Antibodies raised against a TrpE-Ttg-1 fusion protein precipitate an 18-Kd nuclear protein from metabolically labeled 8402 cells. Immunofluorescence of N2a cells shows a nuclear pattern. The two potential zinc finger domains in Ttg-1 are highly homologous to similar regions in lin-11, mec-3, and lsl-1. This data suggests that Ttg-1 may be involved in gene regulation. 
1	Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in normal ovarian epithelium and ovarian cancer. II. Relationship between receptor expression and response to epidermal growth factor. Previously we have shown that epidermal growth factor acts as a mitogen for some, but not all, ovarian cancer cells in culture. In this study we examined the effect of epidermal growth factor on proliferation of normal human ovarian epithelial cells in monolayer culture. We found that epidermal growth factor stimulated twofold to fourfold increases in proliferation in epithelial cells from each of five normal ovaries (p less than 0.01). In addition, Scatchard analysis of binding of epidermal growth factor tagged with iodine 125 indicated the presence of high-affinity receptors in all of the ovarian epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cell lines. The number and affinity of receptors was similar in the normal epithelium and cancer cell lines, and there was no relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor number and responsiveness to epidermal growth factor. We conclude that human ovarian epithelial cells normally express epidermal growth factor receptors and that epidermal growth factor acts as a mitogen for these cells. Although the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor often is attenuated in ovarian cancer cell lines, loss of responsiveness to epidermal growth factor does not appear to be due to decreased receptor expression. 
5	Tissue expansion of the head and neck. Indications, technique, and complications. Tissue expansion is indicated in the reconstruction of various defects of the head and neck in instances where there is inadequate adjacent tissue to allow either primary closure of the defect or repair with a local flap. It may also be indicated in instances where repair of a defect by an alternative method such as a local, regional, or distant flap will result in an unacceptable donor or recipient site deformity. Although tissue expansion is simplistic in concept, it does require judgment and indepth preoperative planning to ensure optimal results. The complication rate is high for tissue expansion in the head and neck, particularly in the cheek and neck area. Despite the frequency of complications, in the vast majority of cases the intended reconstruction is successful. 
5	Bacteremia with otitis media. To investigate the occurrence and outcome of bacteremia associated with otitis media, charts were reviewed from patients who were 3 to 36 months of age, had temperatures greater than or equal to 39 degrees C, and were diagnosed with isolated clinical otitis media. A total of 2982 patients were identified. Blood cultures were obtained from 1666 (56%). Of the 1666 patients, who had blood drawn for cultures, 50 (3.0%) had bacteremia. These included 39 with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 with Haemophilus influenzae, 2 with Neisseria meningitidis, 3 with Salmonella species, and 2 with Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of bacteremia increased at higher temperatures, being 1.9% at temperatures less than or equal to 40 degrees C and 5.0% at temperatures greater than 40 degrees C. Younger children were more likely to have bacteremia; 3.7% less than or equal to 12 months of age, 2.4% 13 to 24 months of age, and 1.9% 25 to 36 months of age had blood culture results that were positive (not significant). Reevaluation of the 50 bacteremic patients showed that 9 patients had continued fever, 3 patients had persistent bacteremia, pneumonia developed in 1 patient, and meningitis developed in 1 patient. It was concluded that (1) 3% of young febrile children with otitis media have bacteremia at the time of evaluation, a rate comparable to that previously reported in children with no focus of infection; (2) the incidence of bacteremia increases at higher temperatures; and (3) most febrile children with otitis media do well. The clinician must therefore weigh the potential benefit of drawing a blood culture to identify children at risk for complications against the inherent cost, inconvenience, and discomfort. 
5	Approach to the patient with genital ulcer disease. The three major diseases characterized by genital ulcers--genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid--are common, with genital herpes being most common in industrialized countries and chancroid being most common in developing countries. One fourth to one half of patients with genital ulcers have no diagnosed cause for their illness despite diagnostic efforts. The bulk of these cases is probably constituted by one of the three diseases for which diagnostic tests are falsely negative. There is accumulating evidence that genital ulcers facilitate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and they may also be markers of high-risk behavior for acquisition of HIV. Appropriate therapy of patients with genital ulcers (as well as their sexual partners) depends on accurate diagnosis. Patients with genital ulcers, particularly those with syphilis or chancroid, should be encouraged to undergo testing for HIV infection. 
5	Persistent ectopic pregnancy following laparoscopic linear salpingostomy. As the surgical approach for ectopic pregnancies evolves from radical to conservative procedures, the potential hazard of persistent ectopic pregnancy has become increasingly pertinent. From September 1, 1986 to August 31, 1989, 11 women with persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic salpingostomy were diagnosed and treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Persistent ectopic pregnancy was suspected in nine cases because of symptoms and in two because of plateauing beta-hCG titers. Ten of 11 patients underwent repeat surgery. Eight had partial or complete salpingectomy of the involved ipsilateral tube, two had repeat salpingostomies, and one was treated with methotrexate. When the 11 women with persistent ectopic pregnancies were compared with 70 patients treated successfully by laparoscopic salpingostomy using multivariate stepwise logistic regression, smaller size of the ectopic (P less than .01) and fewer days of amenorrhea (P less than .05) predicted persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic salpingostomy. Based upon our experience, we believe that earlier-treated ectopic pregnancies (ie, fewer than 42 days of amenorrhea) and/or smaller ectopics (ie, 2.0 cm or less in diameter) require treatment with particular caution and close postoperative surveillance. 
3	Anoxic injury of mammalian central white matter: decreased susceptibility in myelin-deficient optic nerve. The rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white matter tract, rapidly loses excitability when it is exposed to anoxia and is irreversibly damaged by prolonged anoxia. Neonatal optic nerve is extremely resistant to anoxia-induced dysfunction and injury; the adult pattern of response to anoxia appears between 10 and 20 days postnatal, that is, during the period of oligodendroglial proliferation and myelination. To test the hypothesis that myelination, or associated events, confer anoxic susceptibility on developing white matter, we analyzed the effects of anoxia on the myelin-deficient (md) strain of rat. Acutely isolated optic nerves from 19- to 21-day-old md rats and control optic nerves from unaffected male littermates were maintained in vitro at 37 degrees C, and exposed to a standard 60-minute period of anoxia. The supramaximal compound action potential was recorded and amplitude of the compound action potential, expressed as % of amplitude before anoxic exposure, was determined. The compound action potential was nearly abolished within 3 to 6 minutes after onset of anoxia in control optic nerves, while optic nerves from md rats displayed a slower decrease in compound action potential amplitude during anoxia, with a distinct action potential present even after 60 minutes of anoxia. Optic nerves from md rats showed significantly greater recovery of compound action potential (71 +/- 25%) than did control optic nerves (33 +/- 21%; p less than 0.02) after 60 minutes of anoxia. These findings support the hypothesis that myelination, or changes associated with it, may be important in the development of anoxic susceptibility in central white matter. 
5	Evidence for hypomotility in non-ulcer dyspepsia: a prospective multifactorial study. A prospective multifactorial study of symptoms and disturbance of gastrointestinal function has been undertaken in 50 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Objective tests including solid meal gastric emptying studies, gastric acid secretion, E-HIDA scintiscan for enterogastric bile reflux, and hydrogen breath studies were carried out in all patients and validated against control data. Gastroscopy and biopsy were carried out in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients only. Non-ulcer dyspepsia patients were categorised on the basis of predominant symptoms as: dysmotility-like dyspepsia (n = 22); essential dyspepsia (n = 14), gastro-oesophageal reflux-like dyspepsia (n = 11); and ulcer-like dyspepsia (n = 3). In the total non-ulcer dyspepsia population, solid meal gastric emptying was delayed (T50 mean (SEM) = 102 (6) minutes (patients) v 64 (6) minutes (controls), (p less than 0.01) and high incidences of gastritis (n = 26) and Helicobacter pyloridis infection (n = 18) were found. An inverse correlation was observed between solid meal gastric emptying and fasting peak acid output (r = -0.4; p less than 0.01). Indeed gastric emptying was particularly prolonged in eight patients (T50 mean (SEM) = 139 (15) minutes) with hypochlorhydria. In the non-ulcer dyspepsia population oral to caecal transit time of a solid meal was delayed (mean SEM = 302 (14) minutes (patients) v 244 (12) minutes (controls) (p less than 0.01]. Seven patients had a dual peak of breath hydrogen suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. No association was observed between symptoms and any of the objective abnormalities. 
5	Antibody-enhanced infection of monocytes as the pathogenetic mechanism for severe dengue illness. Antibody-dependent enhancement of certain virus infections can occur in cells expressing Fc receptors. This mechanism plays an important pathogenetic role in the development of complications associated with dengue virus infection, including dengue hemorrhagic infection and dengue shock syndrome. The virulence of the virus, characterized by the ability to infect Fc receptor-bearing monocytes also influences the development of these severe illnesses. 
2	Primary and metastatic pulmonary meningioma. Patient 1 was a 53-year-old man who had a very rare primary pulmonary meningioma that developed in the left lingular segment. When this report was written, 7 years had passed since he underwent operation, and no recurrence of the meningioma had been detected. In Patient 2, a 61-year-old woman, multiple pulmonary metastases were confirmed 19 years after she had undergone operation for multiple cerebellar meningiomas, and the metastases were resected. After 2 years, multiple intraperitoneal metastases were found, and thus aggressive surgery was performed. Currently, 22 years after the operation for the primary cerebellar meningioma, the patient is alive without any subjective symptoms, although intraperitoneal metastases have recurred. To date, only four cases (all in women) of primary pulmonary meningioma have been reported. Case 1 reported in this article is thus the first case in a male patient to be reported, and, in addition, this patient also has the first reported case to have been evaluated for more than 5 years. In Case 2, however, each of the excised extracranial tumor lesions was histologically homogeneous and showed a hemangiopericytomatous pattern. The histologic picture of those tumor lesions was exactly the same as the picture of a small portion of the cerebellar meningiomas excised 19 years earlier. Thus, all those extracranial tumor lesions were diagnosed to be metastatic meningiomas. However, it is difficult to explain why there had been no symptoms for as long as 19 years until the pulmonary metastases were discovered. 
5	Predictors and prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea and snoring in 1001 middle aged men. One thousand and one men, aged 35-65 years, were identified from the age-sex register of one group general practice. Over four years 900 men were visited at home and asked questions about symptoms potentially related to sleep apnoea and snoring. Height, weight, neck circumference, resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and spirometric values were also determined. All night oximetry was then performed at home and the tracing analysed for the number of dips in SaO2 of more than 4%. Subjects with more than five dips of 4% SaO2 or more per hour were invited for sleep laboratory polysomnography. Seventeen per cent of the men admitted to snoring "often." Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.2%), cigarette consumption (r2 = 3.4%), and nasal stuffiness (r2 = 2%) as the only significant independent predictors of snoring. Together these account for at least a sixfold variation in the likelihood of being an "often" snorer. Forty six subjects (5%) had greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates of over five an hour and 31 of these had full sleep studies. Three subjects had clinically obvious and severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea, giving a prevalence of three per 1001 men (0.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.9%). Eighteen men had obstructive sleep apnoea only when supine and in 10 the cause of the SaO2 dipping on the original home tracing was not elucidated. The greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates correlated with the history of snoring. Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.9%), alcohol consumption (r2 = 3.7%), age (r2 = 1%) and obesity (r2 = 1%) as the only significant independent predictors of the rate of overnight hypoxic dipping. This study shows that snoring in this randomly selected population correlates best with neck size, smoking, and nasal stuffiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea, defined by nocturnal hypoxaemia, correlates best with neck size and alcohol, and less so with age and general obesity. 
4	Differential light scattering cuvettes for the measurement of thromboemboli in high shear blood flow systems. Newly developed optical scattering cuvettes were constructed as a modification of our existing 1.0 mm and 3.0 mm internal diameter (ID) cuvettes to facilitate the measurement of platelet microemboli ranging from 20 microns to 1,000 microns diameter in whole blood in 0.9 mm ID flows ranging from 250 to 4,000 ml/min. A perturbation solution to the one-speed radiative transport equation was used in the design and calibration of these cuvettes. A series of tests were performed with these cuvettes in an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device bovine model, and in a recirculating closed-loop flow system containing anticoagulated whole baboon blood, to determine to what extent they affect platelet and erythrocyte function ex vivo and in vitro. Serial hemolysis tests, thromboxane radioimmunoassay measurements, platelet counts, and activated partial thromboplastin times were measured. All of these tests with cuvettes in the extracorporeal and in vitro circuits were statistically indistinguishable from baseline measurements, suggesting the usefulness of this system for the measurement of microemboli in blood-contacting materials of extracorporeal circuits and cardiac assist devices. 
5	A controlled clinical trial to assess the effect of a calcium channel blocker on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis To determine whether calcium channel blockers influence the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, 383 patients age 65 years or less with 5-75% stenoses in at least four coronary artery segments were selected at random within 1 month of coronary arteriography to participate in double-blind therapy with a placebo or nicardipine 30 mg three times daily. Coronary events (5 deaths, 22 myocardial infarctions, and 28 unstable anginas) occurred in 28 of 192 nicardipine patients and 23 of 191 placebo patients (p = NS). At 24 months coronary arteriography was repeated in 335 patients. Progression, defined as a 10% or more worsening in diameter stenosis, measured quantitatively, was found in 147 of 1,153 lesions (12.7%) in 168 nicardipine patients and in 170 of 1,170 lesions (14.5%) in 167 placebo patients (p = NS). Ninety-two nicardipine patients (55%) and 95 placebo patients (57%) had progression at one or more sites (p = NS). Regression, that is, an improvement by 10% or more in diameter stenosis, was seen in 140 of 2,323 lesions (6.0%) overall, with no significant intergroup difference. Among the 217 patients with 411 stenoses of 20% or less in the first study, such minimal lesions progressed in only 15 of 99 nicardipine patients compared with 32 of 118 placebo patients (15% versus 27%, p = 0.046). In this subgroup, 16 of 178 minimal lesions in nicardipine patients and 38 of 233 minimal lesions in placebo patients progressed (p = 0.038). By stepwise logistic-regression analysis, baseline systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04) and the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months (p = 0.002) correlated with progression of minimal lesions. This suggested blood pressure reduction may account for the beneficial action of nicardipine. These results suggested nicardipine has no effect on advanced coronary atherosclerosis but may retard the progression of minimal lesions. 
5	Evaluation of the pre-S (pre-S(1)Ag/pre-S(2)Ab) system in hepatitis B virus infection. The diagnostic and prognostic value of pre-S(1)Ag and pre-S(2)Ab was investigated in 69 HBsAg surface antigen positive patients--14 with acute hepatitis B, 30 with chronic liver disease (six chronic persistent hepatitis, 14 chronic active hepatitis, 10 with cirrhosis) and in 25 asymptomatic carriers. Pre-S(1)Ag was found in all patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection regardless of viral replication. In contrast, pre-S(2)Ab was not detected in any patients. Acute hepatitis was studied sequentially with periodic controls at 20 day intervals. Pre-S(1)Ag cleared before HBsAg in six of 14 (43%) patients who progressed favourably, and the two antigens cleared simultaneously in eight of 14 (57%) cases. Patients with early clearance of pre-S(1)Ag progressed favourably, thus indicating the prognostic value of this test, which, however, is still of limited practical application given the small temporal difference between the moment of clearance of the two antigens. The first markers to clear, however, were HBeAg and DNA-HBV, which showed significant differences with respect to the clearance of HBsAg. Moreover, pre-S(2)Ab appeared before HBsAb in 57.1% of our patients and was found in some patients before pre-S(1)Ag and HBsAg had cleared (42.8%), thus allowing complete viral clearance and acute HBV infection to be predicted earlier. 
3	Elderly men with histories of heavy drinking: correlates and consequences. Recognition that the physical, psychological and social consequences of substance abuse may persist throughout the life span has led to increased study of the impact of lifetime drinking habits on the elderly. We examined the characteristics of elderly men with self-reported histories of having ever been heavy drinker (H+) in a population-based (N = 1,155, mean age = 73.7 years) longitudinal survey of community-dwelling elders; 10.4% of the men reported that they had been heavy drinkers at some time during their lives. H+ men were younger and less educated than non-heavy drinkers (H-) or never drinkers (N). Mortality was higher among H+ men who were current drinkers than among H- or N men. H+ men reported more major illnesses, poorer self-perceived health status, more physician visits, more depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction and smaller social networks than did H- or N men. Self-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living was poorest among H+ men, who also scored the lowest on a mental status examination. Thus, a history of having ever been a heavy drinker is predictive of widespread impairments in physical, psychological and social health and functioning among elderly men. 
5	Avulsion of the rectus femoris tendon: an unusual type of pelvic fracture. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy evaluated in the emergency department after sustaining an acute hip injury during track and field practice. Pelvic radiograph demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the anterior inferior iliac spine. Review of the literature reveals this to be a well recognized, yet unusual and interesting injury. 
4	Selective vasopressin inhibition in rats with heart failure decreases afterload and results in venodilatation. The hemodynamic effects of selective inhibition of arginine vasopressin (AVP) with a V1 antagonist, (CH2)5yreAVPa CL-1-4A, were studied in normal rats (n = 17) and in rats 4 weeks after coronary artery ligation with large myocardial infarctions and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (n = 22). In normal rats AVP inhibition with a 35-micrograms/kg bolus of AVP V1 antagonist did not change heart rate, right atrial, left ventricular systolic, left ventricular end-diastolic or aortic pressures. There were also no changes in mean circulatory filling pressure, unstressed vascular volume, blood volume or venous compliance. In rats with infarction and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, AVP inhibition did not change heart rate, right atrial pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure or blood volume, but mean aortic pressure decreased from 103 +/- 3 to 88 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than .001), venous compliance increased (P less than .001) from 2.17 +/- 0.07 to 3.04 +/- 0.11 ml/mm Hg/kg and unstressed vascular volume decreased from 42.3 +/- 3.1 to 34.7 +/- 2.6 ml/kg (P less than .05). We conclude that inhibition of AVP with a specific V1 antagonist had no effect on the venous or arterial circulations in normal rats, but in rats with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure after chronic myocardial infarction, AVP inhibition decreased arterial pressure and caused venodilatation. 
3	Idiopathic first seizure in adult life: who should be treated? OBJECTIVE--To assess the accuracy of the diagnosis, recurrence rate, and fate after the first recurrence in adult patients with an untreated idiopathic first seizure. DESIGN--Hospital based follow up study. SETTING--One university hospital and three general hospitals in The Netherlands. PATIENTS--165 patients aged 15 years or more with a clinically presumed idiopathic seizure; diagnosis was based on a description of the episode according to prespecified diagnostic criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of additional investigations and follow up regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis; first recurrence; and response to treatment after the first recurrence. RESULTS--Computed tomography showed major abnormalities in 5.5% of the patients and follow up led to doubts about the initial clinical diagnosis in another 6%. Cumulative risk of recurrence was 40% at two years. The cumulative risk of recurrence at two years was 81% (95% confidence interval 66% to 97%) in patients with epileptic discharges on a standard or partial sleep deprivation electroencephalogram, 39% (27% to 51%) in patients with other electroencephalographic abnormalities, and 12% (3% to 21%) in patients with normal electroencephalograms. Treatment was initiated in most patients who had one or more recurrences; 40 (70%) patients were completely controlled, eight (14%) had sporadic seizures, and nine (16%) did not become free of seizures within one year despite treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The decision to initiate or delay treatment should be based on electroencephalographic findings. 
4	The role of neutrophils and platelets in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke. Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by many of the cardinal features of acute inflammation such as neutrophil and platelet activation and accumulation. We sought to determine whether circulating neutrophils or platelets contribute to brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke that includes a fixed duration of superimposed systemic hypotension. We randomized 18 rabbits to receive either antineutrophil antiserum (n = 6), antiplatelet antiserum (n = 5), or nonimmune serum (n = 7). We assessed brain ischemia by measuring cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and infarct size. Following the intracarotid administration of an autologous clot, cerebral blood flow in all groups fell to less than 5 ml/100 g/min during induced hypotension. After restoration of baseline blood pressure, mean cerebral blood flow in neutropenic animals recovered to 20-30 ml/100 g/min while that in control and thrombocytopenic rabbits remained at less than 10 ml/100 g/min. Intracranial pressure in control animals rose steadily to a final value of 241% of baseline, while a much smaller increase (148% of baseline) was noted in the thrombocytopenic group; no change from baseline was evident in the neutropenic group. Infarct size was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced in the neutropenic group but not in the thrombocytopenic group. These results suggest that neutrophils may be important contributors to ischemia-induced brain injury whereas the role of platelets is more subtle. 
5	Nerve growth factor corrects developmental impairments of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the trisomy 16 mouse. The trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, which shares genetic and phenotypic homologies with Down syndrome, exhibits impaired development of the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Basal forebrains obtained from Ts16 and euploid littermate fetuses at 15 days of gestation were dissociated and cultured in completely defined medium, with cholinergic neurons identified by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity. The Ts16 cultures exhibited fewer ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, which were smaller and emitted shorter, smoother, and more simplified neurites than those from euploid littermates. Whereas the addition of beta-nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) augmented the specific activity of ChAT and neuritic extension for both Ts16 and euploid cholinergic neurons, only Ts16 cultures exhibited an increase in the number and size of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons. Furthermore, Ts16 ChAT-immunoreactive neurites formed varicosities only in the presence of beta-nerve growth factor. 
1	Clinical significance of hematologic parameters in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at diagnosis. Three hundred seventeen patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (54 low grade, 180 intermediate grade, 76 high grade, and seven unclassified) treated with chemotherapy were evaluated for the presence of hematologic abnormalities at diagnostic staging. Anemia was present in 42%, leukopenia in 6%, thrombocytopenia in 13%, leukocytosis in 26%, and thrombocytosis in 14% at presentation. The presence of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma was more likely to be associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia than the absence of bone marrow involvement. Although anemia was slightly more common in patients with bone marrow lymphoma than in those without marrow lymphoma, the difference was not statistically significant. Hematologic parameters were similar for patients with B-cell or T-cell lymphoma. Evidence of bone marrow failure with multiple cytopenias was present in 26 patients (8%). Leukoerythroblastosis was present in 2%. Circulating lymphoma was present in 9.5%. Anemic patients had a shorter survival time than nonanemic patients, whether bone marrow was involved by lymphoma or not. Survival was not affected by the presence of leukopenia or mild leukocytosis, but, in patients without marrow lymphoma, leukocytosis with a leukocyte count greater than 20 x 10(9)/l was associated with short survival length. Thrombocytopenia was associated with short survival time only in patients with bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. Patients with multiple cytopenias or leukoerythroblastosis had short survival times, but the presence of circulating lymphoma did not alter survival when compared with other patients with bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. These data suggest that hematologic evaluation at the time of diagnostic staging of NHL provides useful prognostic information that may have therapeutic implications. 
5	Hepatic injury associated with small bowel bacterial overgrowth in rats is prevented by metronidazole and tetracycline. Susceptible rat strains develop hepatobiliary injury following the surgical creation of self-filling blind loops that cause small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Luminal bacteria or their cell wall polymers were implicated in the pathogenesis of the lesions because sham-operated rats and rats with self-emptying blind loops, having only slightly increased bacterial counts, did not develop hepatic injury. In this study, antibiotics with different spectra of activities were continuously administered starting 1 day or 22 days after surgery to determine which intestinal flora may be responsible for the development of hepatic injury in rats with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Four weeks following surgery, Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics had elevated liver histology scores (8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4) and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (269 +/- 171 vs. 84 +/- 24) compared with sham-operated rats, P less than 0.001. Oral gentamicin as well as oral and intraperitoneal polymyxin B, which binds endotoxin, did not prevent hepatic injury in rats with self-filling blind loops. However, oral metronidazole and tetracycline therapy continuously administered beginning 1 day after surgery diminished hepatic injury (histology score 3.0 +/- 1.8, 2.9 +/- 1.1; aspartate aminotransferase 87 +/- 25, 98 +/- 34; respectively P less than 0.001 compared with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics). Metronidazole also protected Wistar rats that require 12 weeks to develop hepatic injury following experimentally induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth compared with rats with self-filling blind loops that received no antibiotic treatment (histology score 10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 1.1, and aspartate aminotransferase 273 +/- 239 vs. 76 +/- 20, P less than 0.001). When rats started metronidazole therapy 22 days after self-filling blind loop surgery, elevated aspartate aminotransferase values decreased to normal during the next 77 days and final histology scores were normal. All rats with self-filling blind loops had negative peritoneal, liver, spleen, and blood cultures but approximately 75% of mesenteric lymph node cultures were positive irrespective of antibiotic treatment. Because Bacteroides species have been implicated in causing vitamin B12 and disaccharidase deficiencies in rats with self-filling blind loops, we documented the presence or absence of these organisms from blind loops using selective culture techniques. Metronidazole and tetracycline eliminated Bacteroides sp. from blind loops, but polymyxin B and gentamicin did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	Histopathologic evidence of fibrovascular ingrowth four weeks after placement of the hydroxyapatite orbital implant. We studied the histopathologic findings after placement of an orbital hydroxyapatite implant in a patient. The implant was placed after enucleation for a choroidal melanoma and was removed four weeks later because histopathologic examination of the enucleated globe disclosed tumor invasion of the optic nerve that necessitated further orbital tissue removal. Our histopathologic findings confirm that there is significant ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue in these implants, even within weeks of implantation. 
3	Cavernous-carotid thrombosis and ocular motor paresis A 64-year-old man presented with the acute onset of unilateral blindness and ipsilateral ocular motor paresis. Occlusion of the central retinal artery associated with thrombosis of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus was demonstrated by angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Cases of carotid thrombosis associated with ipsilateral ocular motor paresis are rare. The pathophysiology of intracavernous carotid thrombosis is discussed in connection with blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus. 
4	Precertification for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in Medicare beneficiaries: a melting pot or a need for better national standards? The Health Care Financing Administration has contracted with state peer review organizations (PROs) in its effort to assure the quality of services and eliminate unreasonable and inappropriate care provided Medicare beneficiaries. By law, each state PRO must select 10 procedures for precertification. Coronary angioplasty has been chosen by 45 PROs for precertification and criteria in each state were developed with the advice of local physicians. This report describes the findings of a survey of these precertification criteria in an effort to determine their variability and to compare the PRO criteria to published national criteria created by expert panels. Current precertification criteria of Medicare beneficiaries show significant variability in the priorities and the clinical practice of cardiologists in performing coronary angioplasty, despite established and published guidelines for its safe and efficacious use. It is likely that the establishment of locally based criteria for coronary angioplasty will be geographically uneven and probably have a less than expected impact on the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. 
4	Diabetic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this article was to review the clinical and experimental features of diabetic cardiomyopathy, with particular relevance to the Black population. One hundred thirty-seven studies were identified, of which 57 were selected as references for this article. Diabetes is associated with the development of cardiomyopathy, independent of coronary atherosclerosis. Pathological studies show myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis; microvascular pathology is also present, but all of these pathological findings have an uncertain relationship to myocardial failure. Hemodynamic findings of both congestive and restrictive cardiomyopathy have been described. Noninvasive studies revealed abnormal systolic and diastolic function in many diabetic subjects, particularly in the presence of diabetic complications and/or hypertension. Experimental studies have focused on the mildly diabetic dog and the severely diabetic rat. One year of diabetes in dogs resulted in decreased left ventricular compliance and increased interstitial connective tissue. Studies in the diabetic rat showed a marked slowing of contraction and relaxation. Chronic insulin therapy reversed the changes in the rat model. Combining hypertension with diabetes in the rat resulted in increased myocardial and coronary microvascular pathology and greater changes in isolated muscle function, electrophysiology, and contractile protein biochemistry. Many hypertensive diabetic rats died spontaneously, showing signs of congestive heart failure. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of heart failure in diabetic subjects and occurs more frequently in those with microvascular complications and/or hypertension. Clinical studies are needed to clarify the natural history of this disorder, focusing on the benefits of tight control of hyperglycemia and treatment of associated hypertension. Experimental studies will clarify the pathophysiology and contribute to improved therapy. The high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Blacks makes these considerations especially relevant to this population. 
4	The relationship between sex hormones and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in healthy adult men. The objective of this study was to clarify the complex and uncertain relationship between endogenous sex hormones and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in healthy men. Fifty-five healthy adult men were consecutively recruited from an ongoing cross-sectional study of cardiovascular disease risk factors from a lipid research clinic at the University of Washington, Seattle. Subjects receiving medication were excluded. Multiple linear regression analysis identified several factors that correlated highly significantly with HDL cholesterol levels, including alcohol intake; frequency of strenuous exercise; age; levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride; and carbohydrate intake. Nearly 80% of the heterogeneity in HDL cholesterol levels could be accounted for by these factors. Despite finding significant correlations with factors known to influence HDL cholesterol levels, no correlation with estradiol level, testosterone level, or the ratio of estradiol to testosterone levels was apparent. In conclusion, endogenous sex hormones do not appear to influence HDL cholesterol levels in healthy adult men. Alternatively, a large proportion of the heterogeneity in HDL levels in this group of men can be accounted for by environmental factors. The disparity between this conclusion and others may be partially due to differences in accounting for these confounding variables. 
4	Initial CT findings in 753 patients with severe head injury. A report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank. In this prospective multicenter study, the authors have examined data derived from the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans of 753 patients with severe head injury. When the CT findings were related to abnormal intracranial pressure and to death, the most important characteristics of the scans were: midline shift: compression or obliteration of the mesencephalic cisterns: and the presence of subarachnoid blood. Diffuse hemispheric swelling was also found to be associated with an early episode of either hypoxia or hypotension. 
1	Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts. Thirty-seven patients with carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBD), diagnosed over 14 years from 1974 to 1987, were studied retrospectively. The most common presenting complaint was jaundice, followed by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. The majority of EHBD carcinomas were located at the middle third of the bile duct (43.2%), followed by upper third bile duct (37.8%), and lower third bile duct (18.9%). The resectability of the surgically managed group was 44.4%. The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma. The 30-day postoperative mortality was 30.6%. The mean overall survival of the patients with EHBD carcinoma was 11.2 months. Patients with distal third tumors had the best prognosis with a mean overall survival of 16.0 months. The mean overall survival of patients with upper-third and middle-third tumors were 10.9 months and 9.4 months. A high index of suspicion of the disease as well as earlier, aggressive surgery may improve patient survival. 
1	Correlation between estrogen receptor status and histological malignancy in human breast cancer. Sixty-two breast carcinoma patients underwent mastectomy and were analyzed for correlations between estrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumor and the histological findings of tumor, age, nodal status, and tumor size. An immunocytochemical assay for the detection of ER in breast carcinomas was used to evaluate the staining intensity index (SII) of the ER level of the tumors, which was calculated from the staining intensity of cancer cells and the percentage of ER-positive cancer cells. The histological differentiation of carcinomas showed a strong correlation with the SII. A statistically significant (F = 10.580, P less than 0.0005) negative correlation was found between the grade of malignancy and the SII. Patients under 50 years of age tended to have a lower SII, whereas patients over 49 years of age tended to have a higher SII. The tumor size, and nodal status showed no correlations with the SII in any of the patients. The histological differentiation of the tumor cells showed a strong correlation with the heterogeneity of the distribution of ER-positive cells in breast cancers. 
2	Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The Emory University experience. The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become a practical alternative to proctocolectomy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and polyposis coli. To evaluate its success, the Emory University Affiliated Hospital experience from February 1984 to March 1989 was retrospectively reviewed. There were a total of 50 patients identified; 84 per cent had ulcerative colitis, and 16 per cent had polyposis coli (familial polyposis and Gardner's syndrome). The majority of these patients underwent a two-stage operation, but one-third required a three-stage procedure due to difficulty in mucosal proctectomy or toxic megacolon. J-pouch construction was performed in 72 per cent of patients, S-pouch construction in 14 per cent, straight ileo-anal anastomosis in 8 per cent, and lateral isoperistaltic ileo-anal anastomosis in 6 per cent. Of the 50 patients, 36 (72%) have had closure of the temporary ileostomy. Fourteen patients have not had ileostomy closure due to change in diagnosis to Crohn's disease, operative complications, or ileostomy closure pending. The combined operative morbidity per patient for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and the closure of the ileostomy was 32 per cent. This included bowel obstruction, 16 per cent; pelvic abscess, 6 per cent; and ileo-anal separation, 4 per cent. Follow-up on patients with ileostomy closure ranged from 6 months to 4 years (mean, 1.3 years). Stool frequency was 5.9 stools per 24 hours at 6 months and improved with time. During the follow-up period, all patients were eventually completely continent of stool during the day, and most became completely continent of stool at night. 
5	Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The emergence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a viable alternative to traditional cholecystectomy has been greeted with enthusiasm by the surgical community. This new technique is not without complications, both potential and real. The complications associated with diagnostic laparoscopy are well documented, as are those associated with traditional cholecystectomy. All of these may also be seen with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The incidence of their occurrence, however, may vary. It remains too early to evaluate the complication rates from this new procedure, as reports of large series are just beginning to emerge. Early reports are encouraging but caution that bile duct injury, hemorrhage, and even death may occur. Early enthusiasm for this new method must be tempered with care in its practice if complication rates are to be maintained at an acceptable level and the procedure is to earn a permanent place in the armamentarium of the surgeon. 
2	Nonpropulsive esophageal contractions and gastroesophageal reflux. Nonpropulsive esophageal contractions radiologically described as tertiary contractions or "corkscrew" esophagus suggest the presence of an underlying motility disorder and may lead to impaired acid clearance. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence and role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with tertiary contractions. Thirty-five consecutive patients with spontaneous, repetitive, nonpropulsive esophageal contractions noted on esophagography were studied with endoscopy, infusion esophageal manometry, and 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring. All patients had esophageal symptoms, mainly dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain, but only three were found to have esophagitis by endoscopy and biopsy. Nineteen patients had repetitive, nonlumen-obliterating, nonperistaltic (tertiary) contractions, six had corkscrew esophagus, and 10 had forceful, lumen-obliterating simultaneous contractions (rosary bead esophagus). Twenty patients (58%) had GER by pH criteria with mean values: % time pH less than 4, 40.9; %upright pH less than 4, 41; %supine pH less than 4, 44.3%; number of episodes with greater than 5 min of pH less than 4, 12. Esophageal motility revealed "nutcracker" esophagus in eight, low LESP in two, and nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 10. Symptoms or severity of nonperistaltic contractions did not correlate with GER. Radiologically demonstrable free reflux or the presence of heartburn did not predict GER. We conclude that 1) GER occurs in up to 58% of patients with nonpropulsive (tertiary) esophageal contractions on esophagography, and may play a role in the induction of abnormal peristaltic activity of the esophageal body; 2) GER is usually not associated with endoscopic evidence of esophagitis or characteristic symptoms, and is recognized by 24-h pH monitoring. We speculate that detection and treatment of GER may improve the symptomatic management of patients with nonpropulsive esophageal contractions. 
1	Hemicorporectomy: a collective review. Hemicorporectomy or translumbar amputation has been described as the most revolutionary of all operative procedures. Frederick E. Kredel, who first voiced the concept of the operation in 1950, referred to it as halfectomy. Demonstration of his cadaver studies established the feasibility of the operation. Amputation is effected through the lower lumbar area of the body. Necessary life functions are preserved in the upper torso. Kredel envisioned hemicorporectomy as a curative operation for locally advanced cancer, limited to the pelvis, not encompassable by standard operative intervention. Additional indications are intractable decubitus ulcers with malignant change, particularly in paraplegics; pelvic organs, and bone infection with nonhealing fistulae; and crushing trauma to the pelvis. The first hemicorporectomy operation was reported in 1960. Thirty-four operations have been recorded in the world literature. Two heretofore unreported cases are added, raising the total to 36. Review of these 36 cases confirms the conviction that hemicorporectomy is a humane and ethical alternative to the suffering encumbered by advancing, painful, malodorous malignant disease not treatable by conventional means. While cure rates are not substantial, the best results are reported in paraplegics with intractable decubitus ulcers with or without malignancy. Rehabilitation is prolonged and costly. Most survivors have been restored to preoperative occupations or other gainful employment. 
5	Ureteral obstruction and ureteral fistulas after aortofemoral or aortoiliac bypass surgery. Ureteral injury after aortofemoral or aortoiliac bypass surgery has seldom been described in the literature considering the large number of bypass operations performed. Some causative factors, such as the position of the bypass, are obvious while others are less clear. However, no attempt has been made to unify criteria to establish a management protocol. Of 154 cases of ureteral units with ectasia reviewed ureteral fistulas were present in 19. Radiological ureteral obstruction appears to precede fistula formation. Symptoms, time of diagnosis and treatment according to the predominant etiology have been discussed. Etiological (in varying degrees of importance), clinical and diagnostic criteria, together with a management and therapeutic protocol in which early and late lesions are clearly differentiated were established, while bearing in mind that not all radiological obstruction patterns correspond to true ureteral lesions. 
4	Downslope claudication in eosinophilic fasciitis: a fourth type of claudication--case presentations. Two patients who presented with discomfort in the calves while walking down a slope were diagnosed as suffering from eosinophilic fasciitis of the lower limbs. Following therapy of the underlying disease, this peculiar discomfort remitted concomitantly with the disappearance of the subcutaneous abnormalities. The authors posit that downslope claudication of the calves in eosinophilic fasciitis constitutes an additional variant of claudication of the lower limbs. 
5	Brain perfusion in acute encephalitis: relationship to prognosis studied using SPECT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cranial computed tomography were sequentially examined in 2 patients with acute encephalitis. Radiographic computed tomography revealed focal low-density areas within a few days of the onset of symptoms in both patients. In SPECT, 1 patient exhibited hyperperfusion in the corresponding area, while the other had a normal scan. The outcome of the former was poor, while the latter recovered fully. Abnormal brain perfusion, thus, coincided with a poor prognosis. SPECT may be used to promptly evaluate the focal change of acute encephalitis. 
4	Digitalis-like activity in human plasma: relation to blood pressure and sodium balance. PURPOSE: On the assumption that renal tubular cells are more important as the target cells for a natriuretic factor than blood cells, we used a well-characterized cultured renal tubular cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), cells to monitor the circulating digitalis-like factor in human plasma and examine its role in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of plasma on binding of radioactive ouabain to monolayered MDCK cells in order to determine the level of a circulating digitalis-like factor. First, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding to MDCK cells in the presence of plasma from 71 outpatients (34 normotensive subjects and 37 hypertensive patients) after incubation for 4 hours. Second, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding after incubation of cells with plasma from 16 hospitalized subjects (eight normotensive subjects and eight hypertensive patients) receiving low and high sodium diets. RESULTS: In Study 1, ouabain binding was lower by 30% with plasma from hypertensive patients than with plasma from normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between individual subject's systolic or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01 or r = -0.29, p less than 0.01). In Study 2, ouabain binding was also significantly reduced by 25% in the presence of plasma from hypertensive subjects as compared with plasma from normotensive subjects irrespective of sodium intake (p less than 0.01). A significant negative correlation was also found for all subjects between either systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01, r = -0.51, p less than 0.01, or r = -0.55, p less than 0.01, respectively). With the changes from low to high sodium intake, there was a corresponding decrease in ouabain binding (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sodium excretion (p less than 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between these two parameters (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a circulating digitalis-like factor, which may act on renal tubular cells as the ouabain-displacing compound, is increased in patients with essential hypertension and also demonstrate that plasma levels may be influenced by changes in dietary sodium intake. 
3	South American blastomycosis: ophthalmic and oculomotor nerve lesions. A case of South American blastomycosis began with an oropharyngeal lesion which was followed by a granulomatous uveitis. The patient was treated with Amphotericin B and showed a clinical regression. Four months later, he developed a right 3rd cranial nerve palsy, aggravating the clinical aspect with a severe generalized involvement of the central nervous system and death. Necropsy showed blastomycotic meningoencephalitis. 
4	Early beneficial effect of streptokinase on left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction. The effect of intravenous streptokinase therapy on the time course of functional recovery was investigated in a controlled study of 64 patients randomized within 3 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Contrast ventriculography was performed 1 to 4 days after AMI and repeated 5 weeks later. Wall motion was analyzed by the centerline method in the central infarct, peripheral infarct and noninfarct regions. In patients with ventriculographic data at the early catheterization, streptokinase-treated patients had less severe hypokinesia in the central infarct region than control patients (-2.9 +/- 0.9 [n = 29] vs -3.4 +/- 0.7 standard deviations below normal [n = 21], p less than 0.05). The benefit of streptokinase was more marked in the peripheral infarct region (-1.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.1 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001). As a result, the ejection fraction was slightly higher in treated versus control groups (46 +/- 10 vs 43 +/- 7%, respectively; difference not significant). At 5 weeks, function in the streptokinase and control groups had diverged further because of continued improvement in the streptokinase-treated patients. This study shows that streptokinase benefits left ventricular (LV) function by 1 to 4 days after AMI, earlier than previously reported. The benefit was not limited to the peripheral infarct region, where ischemia might have been less severe, but was also seen in the central infarct region. The implication is that thrombolytic therapy can improve LV function during the period of myocardial stunning, while myocardial function is still recovering. 
4	Impact of echocardiography on the management of patients with mitral valve prolapse OBJECTIVE: To determine whether echocardiography affects the decisions to use beta blockers or to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients suspected of having mitral valve prolapse (MVP). DESIGN: Retrospective review of echocardiograms and clinical records. SETTING: Military tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: 127 patients with clinically suspected MVP (105) or incidentally discovered MVP (22). MAIN RESULTS: Beta blockers were used more often in patients with suspected MVP and positive echocardiograms (45%) than in patients with normal echocardiograms (13%, p less than 0.001). Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis was recommended more often in patients with suspected MVP and positive echocardiograms (65%) than in patients with normal echocardiograms (11%, p less than 0.001). Presence or absence of a murmur did not influence the decision to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. Patients in whom MVP was incidentally discovered were unlikely to receive either beta blockers or the recommendation for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of echocardiography affect the decisions to use beta blockers or to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients with suspected MVP. 
5	Comparison of pump-driven and spontaneous continuous haemofiltration in postoperative acute renal failure. In a comparison of spontaneous continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration (CAVH) and pump-driven haemofiltration (PDHF) for acute renal failure after surgery, 116 patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit were assigned CAVH (48) or PDHF (68). The method of assignment was that a patient was treated by PDHF if he or she was the only patient requiring treatment at that time (only one pump was available); any other patient coming to the unit would be treated by CAVH. The groups were slightly unbalanced because there were fewer simultaneous cases than expected. The main endpoints were survival rate, control of uraemia, and additional application of haemodialysis. There were no differences between the patient groups in age, duration of treatment, severity of illness, serum creatinine concentration at the start of treatment, or cause of acute renal failure. Both treatments adequately controlled uraemia and fluid overload. However, the survival rate was significantly higher with PDHF than with CAVH (6 [12.5%] vs 20 [29.4%]; p less than 0.05). The daily ultrafiltrate volume was significantly higher with PDHF than with CAVH (15.7 [95% confidence interval 13.6-17.8] vs 7.0 [6.6-7.4] l/day; p less than 0.05). The volume of ultrafiltrate in patients with ischaemic or sepsis-induced acute renal failure was correlated with the survival rate. This finding suggests that the better survival rate in the PDHF group was due to faster elimination of toxic mediators (of molecular weight 800-1000 daltons) through the filter membrane by high-volume haemofiltration. 
3	Immunophenotypic characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid cells in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis. The presence of meningeal involvement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10. These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement. 
5	Prehospital prophylactic lidocaine does not favorably affect outcome in patients with chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to determine the morbidity and mortality in initially stable patients presenting to paramedics with chest pain; to examine possible beneficial effects of its use, including reduction of sudden death syndrome in the prehospital and emergency department setting; and to determine if prophylactic lidocaine is associated with adverse effects in this patient population. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized, prospective study using prophylactic lidocaine in patients complaining of chest pain who presented to our paramedic system between January 1984 and January 1988. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 18 years or older with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin who presented to paramedics during the study period were included. Excluded were patients presenting with warning arrhythmias, second- or third-degree heart block, bradycardias of less than 50, hypotension of less than 90 mm Hg systolic, or known allergy to lidocaine. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized into two groups, the lidocaine-treated group and the control group. An initial bolus of 1 mg/kg IV lidocaine was administered to the lidocaine-treated group. A simultaneous 2 mg/min IV drip was established. Ten minutes after the first dose of lidocaine, a second bolus of 0.5 mg/kg was administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 1,427 patients were entered; 704 received lidocaine, and 723 did not. Discharge diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (31%), unstable angina (33%), other cardiac problems (7%), and noncardiac problems (29%); overall mortality rate was 7.4%. There was an equal distribution of deaths between the lidocaine-treated group (57) and the control group (48). Six patients had a cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting, and 15 had a cardiac arrest in the ED. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias as the precipitating arrest rhythm in patients with acute myocardial infarctions were similar for the lidocaine-treated and control groups. The incidence of adverse effects, including hypotension, bradycardias, second- or third-degree heart blocks, tinnitus, and altered mental status, was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: There are no benefits from the administration of prehospital prophylactic lidocaine in stable patients with chest pain; therefore, routine use in this setting appears unwarranted. 
3	The anatomical basis of the caecocentral scotoma. New observations and a review. It is shown that the 'papillomacular bundle' of optic nerve fibres, although a concept discussed frequently in the clinical literature, lacks a clear anatomical definition. It is suggested that the explanation for this is that the 'bundle' was originally described in autopsy studies of toxic amblyopia, not normal anatomy. The optic nerve fibre projection and vascular architecture of the caecocentral region of the retina is described. These anatomical features are discussed in relation to a number of possible anatomical explanations for the fact that a caecocentral scotoma is the characteristic field defect found in toxic amblyopia. We have been unable to identify a distinct anatomical feature which might explain this vulnerability but suggest that the problem has not as yet been clearly addressed by anatomists. 
4	Enalapril and renal injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain develop kidney damage that resembles the nephropathy seen in some cases of human essential hypertension. Previous studies with a triple drug antihypertensive regimen indicated that proteinuria and glomerular histopathology in spontaneously hypertensive rats might develop despite long-term effective control of systemic blood pressure. To investigate further the relation between hypertension and kidney disease, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril at 15 weeks of age. Blood pressure, protein excretion, and kidney function were measured in those rats at regular intervals during the next year and a half and were compared with untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats and the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto parent strain. Kidney tissue samples from all three groups, collected at autopsy, were stained by immunohistochemical and conventional methods to assess the relative severity and nature of kidney damage. Although enalapril therapy was completely effective in controlling the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, it only postponed the onset of kidney disease. Enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats eventually exhibited albuminuria as severe as that found in hypertensive rats. Kidney vessel pathology was completely prevented with enalapril, but the abnormal accumulation of mononuclear cells in tubulointerstitial and periglomerular sites was the same as in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have concluded that elevated protein excretion in rats of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain is not a secondary consequence of systemic hypertension. Structural abnormalities of renal vessels also do not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of albuminuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Other explanations must be sought to account for the close link between spontaneous hypertension and kidney damage in this animal model. The clear dissociation of kidney disease from systemic hypertension exhibited by spontaneously hypertensive rats may also be relevant for human disease. 
2	The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique. The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique (EDAT) uses noninvasive equipment to record, simultaneously, "feeding respiratory patterns," the time drink entered the mouth, and associated swallow sounds during feeding. The easily portable equipment enabled patients' swallowing ability to be tested, at the bedside if necessary, using a small amount of fruit-flavored drink. The results appear in chart form. EDAT findings from groups of normal subjects aged 2-90 years were compared with those from patients with dysphagia of neurologic origin and normal subjects under experimental feeding conditions. The results revealed maturation of the feeding respiratory pattern in the teenage years and remarkable consistency thereafter. Differences in the recordings between the normal and abnormal subjects were sufficiently marked to allow the findings to be used in the diagnosis of other patients with dysphagia of doubtful neurologic cause. Interpretation of the charts and recorded timings of the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing permitted a more accurate identification of sensory nerve, motor nerve, and functional involvement causing dysphagia of neurologic origin and may be used as a guide to the origin of the sensory deficit. 
5	Transfection and stable transformation of adult mouse Schwann cells with SV-40 large T antigen gene. Cultured Schwann cells derived from adult mouse dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves were transfected with a plasmid containing SV-40 large T antigen gene, and 25 colonies of stable transformants were obtained, one of which was expanded and recloned. This transfected cell line, designated MS1, expressed SV-40 large T antigen and showed continuous cell growth with a doubling time of 27 hours. The MS1 cells had distinct Schwann cell phenotypes such as S-100 protein, laminin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase and P0 protein, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. When MS1 cells were exposed to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (dbc AMP), they extended long bipolar processes two- to ten-fold longer than those of untreated MS1 cells and frequently formed whorl-like alignments similar to palisade formations or organoid patterns observed in human Schwannomas and neurofibromas. These results suggest that transformed Schwann cells can be a useful model for analyzing regulatory mechanisms of Schwann cells, neuron-Schwann cell interactions and experimental Schwann cell neoplasms in vitro. 
5	Survival after hypertonic saline resuscitation from hemorrhage. There has been recent increased interest in hypertonic saline resuscitation from shock and hemorrhage. This study was performed to evaluate the survival effects of hypertonic saline resuscitation. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats of average weight of 325 grams were anesthetized with halothane. Animals were subjected to blood loss of 21 ml/kg over 5 minutes. Intravenous infusion was started 10 minutes after hemorrhage with either lactated Ringer's injection (42 ml/kg) or three per cent NaCl (10.64 ml/kg) chosen randomly. These doses provided equal amounts of sodium. At the end of fluid infusion, blood samples were obtained for electrolyte determination. Rats were observed 3 days for survival. Survival was significantly lower in the three per cent NaCl group compared with the lactated Ringer's group. It is probable that worsened outcome with three per cent NaCl was associated with intracellular dehydration. 
1	Dysgerminoma of the ovary: review of 27 cases. Twenty-seven patients with pure dysgerminoma were seen at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, between January 1980 and December 1984. Of the 10 patients in stage I, 2 patients underwent a unilateral salpingoophorectomy (USO) and were kept under observation without any adjuvant therapy, while the remaining patients received adjuvant treatment following surgery. All of the 6 patients in stage II and 4 of 7 in stage III had total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAHBSO) followed by postoperative radiotherapy. One patient presented in stage IV and 3 patients presented with recurrence after previous definitive treatment undertaken at other institutions. The disease free, as well as the overall survival, at 108 months, for the 24 cases primarily treated at this institution, is 81% and 88% respectively, and, for patients in stages I and II, 100% (Kaplan-Meier estimation). The need for controlled clinical trials to devise optimal therapy in the early clinical stages and use of chemotherapy for advanced stages of this highly curable entity are stressed. 
5	Angiographic localization of spinal cord blood supply and its relationship to postoperative paraplegia. Forty-seven patients underwent selective catheterization of middle and lower thoracic intercostal and upper lumbar arteries to define the origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz. One patient had significant atheroembolism, and a second had transient lower extremity paresthesias. No other complications occurred. The origin was found in 26 (55%), and 21 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with this knowledge. When the critical lumbar or intercostal artery could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients survived, and one was paralyzed. However, if the aneurysm repair mandated a midgraft anastomosis to intercostal arteries critical to spinal cord perfusion, seven of nine patients either died or were paralyzed (p less than 0.05). In the group of 19 patients operated on in whom spinal cord blood supply was not identified three patients had a technically unsuccessful operation; two died, and one was paralyzed. Twelve of 16 patients who had an adequate, but unsuccessful attempt at localization were treated by intercostal "neglect" and survived. Late paresis developed in two patients, but they are walking now. One of the patients who died had multiple systems failure and awakened paraplegic. She had a patent, enlarged, thoracic radicular artery at T-5 which probably supplied to spinal cord and which was missed angiographically. Paralysis was associated with aneurysm extent (group 2 and III B, dissections vs group 1 & 3, p less than 0.05). Selective intercostal angiography requires further refinement, but it is safe and offers the promise of understanding the mechanisms and risks of spinal cord complications after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms. 
1	Failure to detect human T-cell leukemia virus-related sequences in multiple sclerosis blood. We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences. DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. 
5	AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented. The electrodiagnostic approach to patients with this neuropathy is reviewed emphasizing new developments. The interpretation of the findings in this patient centers around issues of pathophysiology and methodology. 
4	Right ventricular dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evaluation and management. Cor pulmonale is an important consequence of COPD. Although the incidence is not precisely known, it is seen more frequently in patients with hypoxemia, CO2 retention and severely reduced FEV1. When present, it limits peripheral oxygen delivery, increases shortness of breath, and reduces exercise endurance. It is also associated with higher mortality rates independent of other prognostic variables. Numerous factors may contribute to the development of cor pulmonale in patients with COPD, but its primary cause is chronic alveolar hypoxia resulting in pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. The physical exam, chest radiograph and ECG may be helpful in detecting the presence of cor pulmonale, but because of anatomic changes that occur in the chest, these tests are often insensitive in patients with COPD. Noninvasive diagnostic techniques utilizing Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography allow for detection of RV dysfunction at an earlier stage and in most cases, preclude the need for right heart catheterization. LTO2 is the only therapy shown to improve survival in patients with COPD. However, statistical proof correlating improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics with increased survival is lacking. Bronchodilators, such as the beta 2 agonists and especially theophylline, may have beneficial effects on pulmonary hemodynamics in addition to their effect on respiratory function and are useful in COPD when RV dysfunction is present. Diuretics and phlebotomy are also useful in improving symptoms in appropriate patients. Vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors may improve pulmonary hemodynamics acutely, but may lower arterial PO2 by worsening ventilation-perfusion matching or blunt the improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics seen with supplemental oxygen. The long-term benefits of these agents have not been proven and their routine use in patients with cor pulmonale due to COPD cannot be recommended. 
5	Granulomatous sialadenitis. Granulomatous inflammation in salivary tissues is most often a response to liberated ductal contents, particularly mucin, in various degrees of obstructive sialadenopathy. Far less often is a granulomatous sialadenitis the result of specific infective granulomas or systemic granuloma-forming diseases. In these instances, the salivary parenchymal involvement is usually secondary to disease localization in regional lymph nodes. 
4	Use of arterial compliance for evaluation of hypertension. Arterial compliance describes a change in the volume of arteries following a change in blood pressure. The physical basis of the compliance concept and experimental procedures in animals both indicate that the relation between arterial compliance and blood pressure pattern is often unclear. Compliance is pressure-dependent because of the biphasic elastin and collagen composition of arteries and, hence, decreases when blood pressure increases. Compliance also determines the pulsatile amplitude of the pressure wave by regulating the buffering function of an artery's face to the cardiac pump and, accordingly, its reduction induces a selective increase in systolic level. The questions are whether these theoretical and experimental phenomena can be extrapolated to human hypertension and whether they can be assessed from indirect measurement of arterial compliance by means of a time-domain analysis of arterial pressure and flow waves via various models of the arterial tree. Whatever the method and site of measurement, arterial compliance was found to be decreased in different forms of hypertension. This low compliance can be considered to have a causal role in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In contrast, in patients with systolo-diastolic hypertension physiologic and pharmacologic arguments exist against the fact that low arterial compliance may be the pure consequence of mean blood pressure elevation. Moreover, it is suggested that aging acts in concurrence with pressure elevation to decrease arterial compliance, and that in certain hypertensive patients additional factors, perhaps atherosclerotic in nature, contribute to impair the elastic properties of arteries. 
3	Infantile CNS spongy degeneration--14 cases: clinical update. We studied 14 Arab infants with infantile spongy degeneration, 13 of whom were products of consanguineous marriages. They presented in infancy with macrocephaly, poor visual behavior or blindness, and axial hypotonia with appendicular spasticity. Brain CT and MRI showed diffuse symmetric leukoencephalopathy, even before neurologic symptoms. There were relatively normal EEGs. The visual evoked responses (P100) were either absent or delayed early in the course. The brainstem auditory evoked responses showed milder abnormalities, with loss of later components before the earlier ones. Deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured fibroblasts or brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. 
5	Effect of sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on respiratory muscle activity. To investigate the response of inspiratory and expiratory muscles to naturally occurring inspiratory resistive loads in the absence of conscious control, five male "snorers" were studied during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep with and without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene (EMGsc) electromyographic activity were monitored with surface electrodes and abdominal EMG activity (EMGab) with wire electrodes. Subjects were studied in the following conditions: 1) awake, 2) stage 2 sleep, 3) stage 3/4 sleep, 4) CPAP during stage 3/4 sleep, 5) CPAP plus end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) isocapnic to stage 2 sleep, and 6) CPAP plus PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep. Inspired pulmonary resistance (RL) at peak flow rate and PETCO2 increased in all stages of sleep. Activity of EMGdi, EMGsc, and EMGab increased significantly in stage 3/4 sleep. CPAP reduced RL at peak flow, increased tidal volume and expired ventilation, and reduced PETCO2. EMGdi and EMGsc were reduced, and EMGab was silenced. During CPAP, with CO2 added to make PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep, EMGsc and EMGab increased, but EMGdi was augmented in only one-half of the trials. EMG activity in this condition, however, was only 75% (EMGsc) and 43% (EMGab) of the activity observed during eupneic breathing in stage 3/4 sleep when PETCO2 was equal but RL was much higher. We conclude that during NREM sleep 1) inspiratory and expiratory muscles respond to internal inspiratory resistive loads and the associated dynamic airway narrowing and turbulent flow developed throughout inspiration, 2) some of the augmentation of respiratory muscle activity is also due to the hypercapnia that accompanies loading, and 3) the abdominal muscles are the most sensitive to load and CO2 and the diaphragm is the least sensitive. 
1	Vaccination against tumor cells expressing breast cancer epithelial tumor antigen. Ninety-one percent of breast tumors aberrantly express an epithelial tumor antigen (ETA) identified by monoclonal antibody H23. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing tumor antigens have considerable promise in the active immunotherapy of cancer, and we have evaluated the potential of vaccinia recombinants expressing the secreted (S) and cell-associated (transmembrane, T) forms of H23 ETA to elicit immunity to tumor cells expressing ETA. Tumorigenic ras-transformed Fischer rat fibroblast lines FR-S and FR-T, expressing the S or T form of H23 ETA, respectively, were constructed for use in challenge experiments. Expression of H23 ETA in these lines was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. When challenged by subcutaneous seeding of tumor cells, 97% (FR-S) and 91% (FR-T) of syngeneic Fischer rats rapidly developed tumors that failed to regress. Vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ETA-T prior to challenge prevented tumor development in 82% of animals seeded with FR-T cells but in only 61% of animals seeded with FR-S. The vaccinia recombinant expressing the S form was a less effective immunogen, and vaccination protected only 29-30% of animals from developing tumors upon challenge with either FR-S or -T cells. The increased immunogenicity of the recombinant expressing ETA-T was reflected in elevated levels of ETA-reactive antibody in vaccinated animals, confirming that secreted antigens expressed from vaccinia virus are less effective immunogens than their membrane-associated counterparts. 
4	Deprivation in infancy or in adult life: which is more important for mortality risk? Previous ecological studies have suggested that early life factors are important causes of adult cardiovascular and respiratory disease, by showing geographic correlations between past infant mortality rates and present adult mortality rates. However, these studies inadequately take account of the fact that areas which were severely deprived earlier this century remain the most deprived today. Thus the ecological relation between infant and adult mortality rates could simply reflect persistence in the geographic distribution of poor socioeconomic circumstances. To explore this hypothesis further infant mortality rates for 1895-1908 for 43 counties in England and Wales were correlated with cause-specific adult mortality for 1969-73 in people aged 65-74 years, with and without adjustment for present-day social deprivation and social class. The strong simple correlations found between infant mortality in 1895-1908 and adult mortality from various causes in 1969-73 were generally much attenuated or abolished by controlling for indices of present-day socioeconomic circumstances. Our results suggest that previous studies give no strong support for any direct influence of factors acting in early life on adult coronary heart disease mortality risk. Studies which gather data about infancy, childhood, and the full course of adult life are required to clarify this issue. 
5	Botulinum A toxin for the treatment of adult-onset spasmodic torticollis. Thirty-five patients with adult-onset idiopathic torticollis were treated by local injections of botulinum A toxin into dystonic cervical muscles. Substantial improvement with respect to reduction and elimination of pain was found in 81 percent, improvement in posture deformity and involuntary spasms in 70 percent, increased range of motion of the neck in 78 percent, reduction in visible sternocleidomastoid hypertrophy in 86 percent, and improvement in tremor in 65 percent. The syndrome was divided into four subtypes based on pattern of dystonic muscle groups involved in the dystonia, head and shoulder posture, and sternocleidomastoid muscle hypertrophy. Injection strategy based on this subdivision is described. 
1	Insulin secretion and action in patients with pancreatic cancer. The authors investigated insulin secretory capacity and insulin action in 11 preoperative patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 15 age-matched and weight-matched healthy subjects (C). Five patients were classified as diabetic (D), two as impaired glucose tolerant (IGT), and four as nondiabetic (ND). Postabsorptive serum insulin levels (mean +/- SE, in uU/ml) in D (12 +/- 2), IGT (17 +/- 7), and ND (10 +/- 2) were comparable. After administration of 100 g of oral glucose, peak insulin achieved in D (60 +/- 11) was lower than in IGT (101 +/- 26) and ND (83 +/- 20), whereas peak insulin levels in IGT and ND were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in C (45 +/- 6). Comparable insulin response to nonglucose stimuli was documented in all subjects using the slow arginine infusion test with mean serum insulin of 27 +/- 4 in D, 28 +/- 6 in IGT, 34 +/- 10 in ND, and 32 +/- 5 in C. In six patients (P) and six controls, insulin action was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, with glucose turnover rates estimated by [3-3H]glucose infusion. Steady-state plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at 92 +/- 3 (P) and 91 +/- 1 mg/dl (C). After insulin infusion at the rate of 1.0 mU/kg/min, comparable high physiologic insulin levels were observed in P (73 to 104 uU/ml) and in C (81 to 103 uU/ml). Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) were higher in P (2.86 to 3.02 mg/kg/min) than in C (1.50 to 2.80 mg/kg/min). At high physiologic insulin concentrations, negative Ra values were documented in all subjects, and complete suppression of Ra was assumed. Total body glucose use (M) was consistently lower in P (3.90 to 6.40 mg/kg/min) than in C (6.98 to 10.40 mg/kg/min), consistent with a state of insulin resistance. Patients with pancreatic cancer manifest insulin resistance by virtue of a decrease in total body glucose use (M) and decreased insulin response to glucose due to either inherent beta cell dysfunction or decreased islet cell mass. The latter is not identifiable by histologic morphology. 
3	Isolated trigeminal sensory loss secondary to a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm: case report. A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions. 
1	Percutaneous aspiration of brain tumor cysts via the Ommaya reservoir system. We performed percutaneous aspiration of 21 brain tumor cysts in 20 patients using the Ommaya reservoir system. Ages ranged from 3 to 70 years, median 48. Sixteen were primary tumors (12 anaplastic glioma, 2 craniopharyngioma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 1 brainstem glioma) and 4 were metastatic. Fourteen had the CT appearance of a true cyst and 7 a pseudocyst. We placed 18 catheters through twist drill holes via CT stereotactic guidance and 3 through burr holes via CT guidance and effectively aspirated 3 to 50 ml cyst fluid from 1 to 18 times in each patient. Postaspiration CT showed complete or significant reduction in cyst size in all patients in whom it was performed (18 after initial aspiration and 9 after subsequent aspirations). Asymptomatic intracyst hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients after cyst wall biopsy and catheter placement. There have been no other complications at follow-up of 4 to 114 weeks. In our experience, tumor cyst aspiration by the Ommaya reservoir system is as effective as percutaneous needle aspiration, but after catheter placement aspiration can be performed with minimal technical skill, avoiding repeated CT guidance required for needle aspiration of recurrent deep-seated cysts. 
5	Flow cytometric determination of breast tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometric analysis was done on the DNA content of nuclei obtained from different sites of small breast tumors. Although specimens for analysis were obtained within a few millimeters of each other, dramatic differences were occasionally observed in the DNA histograms. In a limited study involving 141 consecutive breast specimens submitted for flow cytometry, 52% (74) were found to have at least one DNA aneuploid population. In 18% of DNA aneuploid tumors, one or more specimens from areas grossly identified as tumor had no DNA aneuploid population. Because of the proposed correlation of aneuploidy with a poorer prognosis and possible responsiveness to chemotherapy, multiple sites should be assayed when flow cytometric DNA analysis is done. 
4	Results of the arterial switch operation in patients with transposition of the great arteries and abnormalities of the mitral valve or left ventricular outflow tract. Between January 1983 and October 1989, 290 patients underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries; 30 (10.3%) of the patients had abnormalities of the left ventricular outflow tract or mitral valve, or both. These abnormalities included isolated pulmonary valve stenosis (n = 9), septal (dynamic) subpulmonary stenosis (n = 5), anatomic (fixed) subpulmonary stenosis (n = 7), abnormal mitral chordae attachments (n = 2) or a combination of abnormalities (n = 7). There were two early deaths, one of which was due to previously unrecognized mitral stenosis and a subpulmonary (neo-aortic) membrane and one late death due to presumed coronary obstruction. Of the nine patients with pulmonary valve abnormalities due to either a bicommissural (n = 5) or a thickened tricommissural (n = 4) valve, only one underwent valvotomy. Peak systolic ejection gradients in these nine patients measured preoperatively ranged from 0 to 50 mm Hg. At follow-up study 5 to 30 months postoperatively, the neo-aortic valve gradient was less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in all patients; three patients had mild neo-aortic regurgitation. Preoperative gradients may overestimate the degree of obstruction because of the increased pulmonary blood flow present in transposition. No patient with "dynamic" subpulmonary obstruction before the arterial switch operation had a surgical procedure performed on the left ventricular outflow tract; none had evidence of subaortic obstruction after the arterial switch. 
5	Malignancy associated with chronic empyema: radiologic assessment. Radiologic findings of six cases of malignancy associated with chronic empyema 5-39 years in duration were reviewed. Pathologic examination confirmed three B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, one round-cell sarcoma, one mesothelioma, and one adenocarcinoma. Retrospective findings on plain chest radiographs suggested the occurrence of malignancy: increased radiopacity in the thoracic cavity, soft-tissue bulgings and/or unsharpness of fat planes in the chest walls, destruction of bone near the empyema, and extensive medial deviation of the calcified pleurae. Computed tomography delineated masses with soft-tissue attenuation more clearly than radiography in all cases. Magnetic resonance images of three cases were informative because empyema cavities were surrounded by low-intensity rims, and two of them showed a signal intensity different from that of necrotic tumors. Scintigraphy revealed increased uptake of gallium in all cases. Ultrasonography was useful for biopsy guidance. Every radiologist should know this entity in observation of chest radiographs obtained in patients with chronic empyema, and further radiologic assessment and aggressive biopsy are recommended if malignancy is suspected. 
4	Influence of hypoxia on adrenergic modulation of triggered activity in isolated adult canine myocytes. Although findings from several reports suggest that nonreentrant or focal mechanisms contribute to the genesis of arrhythmias during early ischemia, the contribution of triggered activity arising from early or delayed afterdepolarizations has not been resolved. We have previously demonstrated that beta- but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation induces afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in isolated normoxic myocytes. In the present study, the influence of the extent of cellular derangements as well as increases in [K+]o on alpha- and beta-adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity was evaluated. Adult canine myocytes were exposed to one of the following experimental conditions with simultaneous intracellular transmembrane action potential recordings: 1) low PO2 (less than 10 mm Hg, obtained using a specially designed hypoxic chamber) and low (6.8) pH; 2) low PO2, low pH, and high extracellular potassium ([K+]o) (10 mM); or 3) severe metabolic inhibition with cyanide (10(-6) M). Cells from each group were superfused with either the alpha-agonist phenylephrine (10(-5) or 10(-7) M, with 10(-5) M nadolol) or the beta-agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Moderate changes in the action potentials were observed under conditions 1 and 2 (moderate hypoxia), whereas marked but reversible changes were observed with cyanide (severe metabolic inhibition). During moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o, delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered activity were elicited by both alpha- (12 of 13 cells) and beta-adrenergic (five of five cells) stimulation. Increasing [K+]o during moderate hypoxia completely abolished the afterdepolarizations induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation and prevented the occurrence of triggered activity. In contrast, the influence of beta-adrenergic stimulation was only attenuated by an increase in [K+]o. Exposure to cyanide completely prevented the induction of afterdepolarizations and triggered activity by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings indicate that moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o is associated with the development of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In contrast, accumulation of [K+]o or severe impairment of cellular metabolism is accompanied by inhibition of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. 
4	Conservative management of aortic lacerations due to blunt trauma. Three patients with angiographically documented thoracic aortic lacerations were managed conservatively over 8 years due to the nonthreatening appearance of the injuries in two and the presence of an associated major closed head injury in a third. The lesion(s) resolved in one, diminished in another, and remained unchanged in the third. At least ten other cases managed similarly are recorded in the literature. In certain selected circumstances this approach may represent a viable alternative to the current standard of immediate surgical correction of aortic injuries. 
2	Risk factors for transmission of hepatitis B virus to Gambian children [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Dec 22-29;336(8730):1596] Risk factors for hepatitis B virus transmission were examined in 973 Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. 33% had evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus and a third of these were carriers. A significant association was found between infection and tropical ulcer scars, and between e antigenaemia and the presence of bedbugs in each child's bed. There was no association between infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. Skin disease and arthropods are the two most likely modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus between children in West Africa. 
4	Role of leukotriene B4 in granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic feline intestine. Several studies have demonstrated that granulocytes accumulate in the intestinal mucosa following ischemia/reperfusion. It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa. Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour. Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples. In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels. The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes. These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel. 
4	Tension pneumopericardium as a complication of single-lung transplantation. Tension pneumopericardium is distinctly uncommon in the adult population. We present a case of tension pneumopericardium as a complication of lung transplantation in a 54-year-old woman with thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension who underwent single-lung transplantation. 
3	Postischemic seizures and necrotizing ischemic brain damage: neuroprotective effect of postischemic diazepam and insulin. Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period. 
2	Miliary tuberculosis presenting as hepatic and renal failure. A 67-year-old man developed hepatic and renal failure over a six-day period. Despite full supportive measures, he died on his 11th day of hospitalization with fulminant DIC and hepatic, renal, and respiratory failure. Postmortem examination revealed acid-fast bacilli in virtually all organ systems. Miliary tuberculosis should be considered as a potentially treatable cause of hepatic failure. 
1	Patient perceptions. The cancer patient's perceptions about treatment, prognosis, and long-term care have emerged in the context of interaction with the changing healthcare system. A brief overview of cancer patients' perceptions regarding their disease and subsequent care is provided. The economic, organizational, and technological environment in which this care is provided and the patient's perceptions of that environment are discussed. In addition to economic pressures, the ever-increasing number of cancer patients, prolonged survival, and patients' perceptions have created changes in the healthcare system. These changes are mediated by important socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic characteristics of the cancer patient. Recommendations to address these changes are discussed. 
5	Improvement in the diagnosis of abscesses associated with endocarditis by transesophageal echocardiography BACKGROUND. Echocardiography is recognized as the method of choice for the noninvasive detection of valvular vegetations in patients with infective endocarditis, with transesophageal echocardiography being more accurate than transthoracic echocardiography. The diagnosis of associated abscesses by transthoracic echocardiography is difficult or even impossible in many cases, however, and it is not known whether transesophageal echocardiography is any better. METHODS. To determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of abscesses associated with endocarditis, we studied prospectively by two-dimensional transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography 118 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis of 137 native or prosthetic valves that was documented during surgery or at autopsy. RESULTS. During surgery or at autopsy, 44 patients (37.3 percent) had a total of 46 definite regions of abscess. Abscesses were more frequent in aortic-valve endocarditis than in infections of other valves, and the infecting organism was more often staphylococcus (52.3 percent of cases) in patients with abscesses than in those without abscesses (16.2 percent). The hospital mortality rate was 22.7 percent in patients with abscesses, as compared with 13.5 percent in patients without abscesses. Whereas transthoracic echocardiography identified only 13 of the 46 areas of abscess, the transesophageal approach allowed the detection of 40 regions (P less than 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of abscesses associated with endocarditis were 28.3 and 98.6 percent, respectively, for transthoracic echocardiography and 87.0 and 94.6 percent for transesophageal echocardiography; positive and negative predictive values were 92.9 and 68.9 percent, respectively, for the transthoracic approach and 90.9 and 92.1 percent for the transesophageal approach. Variation between observers was 3.4 percent for transthoracic and 4.2 percent for transesophageal echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS. The data indicate that transesophageal echocardiography leads to a significant improvement in the diagnosis of abscesses associated with endocarditis. The technique facilitates the identification of patients with endocarditis who have an increased risk of death and permits earlier treatment. 
5	Relationship of transfusion and infectious complications after gastric carcinoma operations. To determine the effect of transfusion on the incidence of postoperative infection, a retrospective cohort study of 196 patients who underwent surgery for gastric carcinoma in the period from 1985 through 1989 was carried out. Seventy-one patients (36.2%) developed postoperative septic complications; they had received an average of 4.2 blood units, as compared with 2.7 units received by patients not affected (p less than 0.0053). The hypothesis of dose-response relationship is supported by the Mantel-Haenszel test, as applied to the overall results (p less than 0.01) and the results grouped by duration of operation (p less than 0.02). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis shows transfusion to be an independent risk factor in the incidence of infection (p less than 0.01), as are antibiotic prophylaxis (p less than 0.015), urinary tract catheterization (p less than 0.002), and the duration of surgery (p less than 0.027). This significance is attained after adjustment for age, gender, period of evolution of symptoms; preoperative infection(s), number of white cells, hemoglobin level and total proteins on diagnosis, location of tumor, tumor, nodes, and metastasis staging, operative technique, drainage of the area of operation, enteral nutrition, and the histologic studies and macroscopic appearance of the tumor. This study is further evidence that transfusion may cause an increased incidence of postoperative infection. 
5	Successful treatment of an excimer laser-associated coronary artery perforation with the Stack perfusion catheter. A 64-year-old woman underwent excimer laser angioplasty of the right coronary artery. The procedure was complicated by perforation, which was successfully managed without complication with a Stack perfusion catheter. This report describes successful nonsurgical treatment of laser-induced coronary perforation and makes recommendations for avoiding this complication in other patients. 
1	Inflammatory atypia on cervical smears. A diagnostic dilemma for the gynecologist. In light of the current controversy on the significance, follow-up and management of women with cervical smears showing "inflammatory atypia" (IA), a study was conducted to correlate the initial cytologic diagnosis of IA with the follow-up findings in colposcopically directed cervical biopsies and smears. From March 1988 through June 1989, 70 women had two consecutive smears reported as IA; all underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy. In 58 patients (83%) the biopsies and smears obtained during colposcopy were negative for condyloma and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Ten patients (14%) had condylomas, and two (3%) had condylomas with CIN (one CIN I and one II). The initial IA smears from those 12 patients were reviewed retrospectively: 2 showed condylomas (they had been undercalled), 5 were "suggestive of condyloma" (the atypical cells were too few or poorly preserved for a definitive diagnosis), and 5 showed IA. None showed cytologic evidence of CIN, most probably because of sampling error. Our results suggest that colposcopy is warranted after two consecutive diagnoses of IA on cervical smears, considering that 17% of the patients in our study showed underlying intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. 
1	Tumor necrosis factor regulates the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 receptors on human acute myeloid leukemia cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) acts as a potent enhancer of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro. We have analyzed the effects of TNF alpha on the expression of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on AML cells. Incubation of blasts from seven patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/mL) and subsequent binding studies using 125I-GM-CSF and 125I-IL-3 show that TNF increases the specific binding of GM-CSF (30% to 280%) and IL-3 (40% to 600%) in all cases. From Scatchard plot analysis it appears that TNF upregulates (1) low-affinity GM-CSF binding sites, (2) common high-affinity IL-3/GM-CSF binding sites, and (3) unique (non-GM-CSF binding) IL-3 binding sites. The effect of TNF is dose dependent and is half maximal at a concentration of 100 U/mL, and becomes evident at 18 hours of incubation with TNF at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C. The GM-CSF dose-response curve of AML-colony-forming units plateaus at a higher level in the presence of TNF, which indicates that additional numbers of cells become responsive to GM-CSF. Incubation of AML blasts with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (protein kinase C activators) does not influence GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that receptor upregulation by TNF is not mediated through activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogates receptor upregulation induced by TNF. In contrast to these findings in AML, TNF does not upregulate GM-CSF receptor numbers on blood granulocytes or monocytes. We conclude that TNF exerts positive effects on growth factor receptor expression of hematopoietic cells. 
5	Intraoperative echocardiography of a dislodged Bjork-Shiley mitral valve disc. The successful management of a patient who suffered an outlet strut fracture of a Bjork-Shiley 60-degree convexo-concave mitral valve prosthesis is reported. Emergency operation was life-saving. Preoperative echocardiography assisted in making a prompt diagnosis, and intraoperative echocardiography allowed the detection and removal of the dislodged disc from the left ventricle at the time of the operation. The role of intraoperative echocardiography in the diagnosis of prosthetic strut fracture is emphasized. 
1	Pancreatic ascites presenting in infancy, with review of the literature. We report a 4-month-old boy with massive ascites in whom a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made on a raised ascitic amylase level after two inconclusive laparotomies. He developed a pseudocyst which was managed with repeated percutaneous needle aspirations, nutrition being maintained intravenously. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a congenital intra-pancreatic cyst. He thrived after operation drainage for recurrent pseudocyst, but repeat ERCP shows that the cyst in the head of the pancreas remains. Pancreatic ascites is rare in children and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A third of reported cases in childhood present in the first year of life. A search for the underlying cause should include an ERCP to demonstrate abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. 
3	Intracranial pressure and cerebrospinal fluid outflow conductance in healthy subjects. Conductance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow (Cout) is an important parameter to be considered in patients with CSF circulation abnormalities. In patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus it is the single most important parameter in determining if the patient needs CSF shunting. The lower normal limit for Cout has been estimated from the effect of shunting in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus, from patients retrospectively reevaluated after recovering from illness, and from patients with known abnormalities in the brain or the CSF system. The true value of Cout in normal individuals, however, has hitherto not been reported. In the present study, Cout has been measured by a lumbar infusion test in eight young volunteers with no suspicion of disease. The mean intracranial pressure (ICP) was 11 mm Hg and a linear relationship was found between CSF absorption and ICP. The mean Cout was 0.11 ml/min/mm Hg and the lower 95% confidence level was 0.10 ml/min/mm Hg. These values are in accordance with those obtained from previous studies. 
1	Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction. Progressive dysphagia is common in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma. Multiple nonsurgical techniques are available to provide palliation and improved nutrition. Simple dilatation is the oldest technique and newer methods may offer greater efficacy. Laser therapy now provides an excellent opportunity to treat obstructing tumors. Placement of an esophageal prosthesis may become particularly useful when dilatation must be performed too frequently or has become ineffective or in the patient with an esophageal-pulmonary fistula. Newer techniques including BICAP tumor probe, intracavitary radiotherapy, or absolute alcohol injection offer promise. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these different palliative techniques for patients with the extremely poor prognosis associated with esophageal cancer. 
2	Operative choledochoscopy: common bile duct exploration is incomplete without it. This paper reviews the reported experience of operative choledochoscopy. Development of choledochoscopes to the currently available rigid and flexible instruments is described. The collected results of both rigid and flexible choledochoscopy are reported. Retained stones occurred in 97 of 2712 stone-positive explorations with the rigid choledochoscope (3.6 per cent) and in 35 of 1726 stone-positive explorations with the flexible choledochoscope (2.0 per cent). Choledochoscopy should now be a mandatory part of common bile duct exploration. 
5	Characterization of the in vitro maturation of monocytes and the susceptibility to HIV infection. The in vitro maturation of peripheral blood monocytes to macrophages can be followed morphologically, and by measurement of cell surface antigens (CD4, HLA-DR, and FcR III) and lysozyme production. We used these markers to correlate monocyte maturation with susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Maturation of peripheral blood monocytes is associated with a decrease in membrane CD4, while HLA-DR and FcR III expression increase along with lysozyme secretion. Cells at all stages of maturation were susceptible to HIV infection, even mature macrophages without CD4 detectably by immunofluorescent staining. Maximal replication was observed in 7-day-old cells. 
5	Therapy of persistent human papillomavirus disease with two different interferon species. Consensus interferon and interferon alfa-2a were used to treat patients with persistent human papillomavirus disease. Thirty-one patients were treated with either consensus interferon or a placebo (25 received active drug and 6 received placebo), and 24 patients were treated with interferon alfa-2a. Of the 25 patients who received consensus interferon, 19 (76%) showed either complete or partial clearing of condyloma 10 and 16 weeks after initiation of therapy; in 22 of the 24 patients (91%) who received interferon alfa-2a, clearing was demonstrated after a similar time period. Thirty of 34 patients who had no response or a partial response requested additional therapy, and 20 of these patients treated with adjunctive therapy had a complete response. The results of this study support the efficacy of both interferons in the treatment of overt condyloma acuminatum and suggest that interferon enhances subsequent adjunctive therapy. 
1	Flow cytometric DNA-ploidy analysis of synchronously occurring multiple malignant tumors of the female genital tract. In this study the authors applied flow cytometric DNA-ploidy analysis to multiple female genital tract malignant tumors in 43 patients, most of whom (n = 37) had bilateral ovarian cancer. An algorithm was developed for calculation of the likelihood ratio of the probabilities that measured DNA index differences between multiple tumor localizations within the same patient could be attributed to measurement variation or to true biologic DNA content differences. The results of this statistical analysis show that in 72% of the cases (31 of 43) this probability ratio exceeded 1. Because the probability that two independent tumors will have a near-identical aneuploid DNA content is very low, this finding supports a metastatic process rather than the occurrence of multiple primary tumors in these patients. Thus, flow cytometric DNA-ploidy analysis can be helpful in the identification of metastatic disease in patients with multiple female genital tract malignant tumors. 
1	Acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's disease with secondary HTLV I seroconversion. The authors observed a pleiomorphic lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's lymphoma in a French Guyana black woman lacking antibodies for human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV I). After two courses of chemotherapy with either mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincaleukoblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), a typical acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma developed with HTLV I seroconversion. Specific HTLV I DNA sequences were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a lymph node biopsy obtained before chemotherapy. The mechanisms of the seroconversion are discussed. 
5	Diffuse hemangiomatosis of the spleen: splenic hemangiomatosis presenting with giant splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In an elderly patient with oligosymptomatic giant splenomegaly, clinical and laboratory data were nondiagnostic, while nonhomogeneous splenic enlargement was the only finding detected by imaging procedures. Splenectomy was performed and diffuse hemangiomatosis of predominantly capillary-type found. The failure of imaging techniques to even hint at the nature of the underlying disorder is comprehensible in view of the organ being essentially replaced in toto by the abnormal vascular channels. Diffuse splenic hemangiomatosis, a rare condition, may cause hypersplenism, and its diagnosis may be elusive because of misleading patterns on imaging. 
5	Chronic neutropenia. A new canine model induced by human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Normal dogs were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) at 10 micrograms/kg/day for 30 d, which caused an initial neutrophilia, followed by a prolonged period of chronic neutropenia. A control dog treated with recombinant canine G-CSF (rcG-CSF) showed persistent neutrophilia over 3 mo. Serum from dogs during neutropenia contained an antibody to rhG-CSF, which neutralized the stimulatory effects of both rhG-CSF and rcG-CSF on dog marrow neutrophilic progenitor cell growth and on NFS-60 cell proliferation. 4 mo after discontinuation of rhG-CSF, the dogs' neutrophil counts returned to the normal range. Rechallenge with the rhG-CSF re-induced severe neutropenia in 1 wk. Neutropenia was transferred by plasma infusion from a neutropenic dog to a previously normal dog. These data suggest that human rhG-CSF immunizes normal dogs and thereby induces neutralization of endogenous canine G-CSF and neutropenia. This model system should allow more precise definition of the in vivo role of G-CSF. 
4	Listerial myocarditis in cardiac transplantation. Clinical signs of heart failure developed in two cardiac transplant recipients and were interpreted initially as graft rejection. Morphologic examination of explanted hearts revealed myocarditis with abscess formation and necrosis consistent with a bacterial process; Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from myocardial tissue in the first case and from blood in both. The first patient also developed signs of meningoencephalitis, but the second had no signs of infection outside the heart. Antimicrobial therapy and retransplantation were successful in eradicating listeriosis. The differential diagnosis of heart failure in cardiac transplant recipients includes infectious myocarditis due to L. monocytogenes. 
5	Post-cannulation radial artery aneurysm--a rare complication. The following case report describes an expanding aneurysmal dilatation of the radial artery which developed 17 days following cannulation. Possible causes of this complication are: abnormal state of the vessel wall, multiple attempts at cannulation, and haematoma or infection at cannulation site. Other major and minor sequelae following arterial cannulation are reviewed. 
5	Sudden cardiac death during exercise in a weight lifter using anabolic androgenic steroids: pathological and toxicological findings. A 21-year-old, previously healthy weight lifter collapsed during a bench press workout. He had taken anabolic androgenic steroids parenterally for the previous several months. Pertinent autopsy findings included marked cardiac and renal hypertrophy and hepatosplenomegaly, with regional myocardial fibrosis and focal myocardial necrosis. Nandrolone (19-nor-testosterone) metabolites were identified in postmortem urine. The possible etiologies of the cardiac findings are discussed. 
1	Transcriptional regulation of ferritin messenger ribonucleic acid levels by insulin in cultured rat glioma cells. Recent data have shown that ferritin, a ubiquitous protein, has a role as a regulator of cellular differentiation. In the present study we have investigated the expression of ferritin mRNAs in cultured C6 cells, a rat glioma cell line, in response to insulin, which has an important role in cellular growth and differentiation. Insulin stimulated steady state levels of both ferritin heavy chain and ferritin light chain mRNAs. An increase in the level of ferritin heavy or light chain mRNA was detected after 2 h of incubation with insulin, and a plateau was reached after 48 h for heavy chain mRNA and after 72 h for light chain mRNA. The responses were dose-dependent and were maximal at 100 nM for both mRNAs. Treatment of cells with actinomycin-D showed that insulin had no effect on the posttranscriptional stability of these mRNAs. Actinomycin-D inhibited insulin-induced accumulation of both mRNAs, suggesting transcriptional stimulation of ferritin genes by insulin. A nuclear run-on assay showed that the insulin-induced increase in ferritin heavy chain mRNA was due to an increase in the rate of gene transcription. We also demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increased ferritin heavy and light chain mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, and that the maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 10 nM on both mRNA levels. IGF-I was not only 10-fold more potent, but the absolute level of maximum stimulation was also about 2-fold greater than that for insulin. The combination of insulin (100 nM) and IGF-I (10 nM) showed no additive effect. The results suggested that the ferritin heavy and light chain genes are transcriptionally regulated by insulin and influenced by IGF-I. 
4	Effect of captopril injection in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. The effect of intravenous captopril was studied in 24 white patients who had moderate to severe hypertension. Patients received incremental doses of 1 to 10 mg delivered at 10 min intervals over 50 to 80 min. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered within 5 to 10 min after the initial dose was administered and continued to decline, reaching a maximum response after 20 min (2 to 4 mg). At this time group mean BP fell from 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 1 to 166 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Additional dose increments to an average cumulative dose of 40 mg did not increase the initial effect. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject. There was a significant correlation between diastolic BP decreases observed in response to intravenous captopril and subsequent long-term oral captopril therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the proportion of patients reaching normotension. We conclude that small intravenous bolus injections of captopril appear to be effective rapidly and are well tolerated in moderate to severe essential hypertension. Short-term intravenous administration seems to predict the response to chronic oral captopril therapy. 
4	Restenosis after directional coronary atherectomy: differences between primary atheromatous and restenosis lesions and influence of subintimal tissue resection. Rates of restenosis were evaluated in 70 patients (74 lesions) after successful directional coronary atherectomy. The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions. After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected. Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%). There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%). Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01). Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37). These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty. The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions. 
1	Bone marrow findings after treatment with recombinant human interleukin-3. In a phase I/II study, bone marrow biopsy specimens and aspirates of 20 patients with malignant tumors but normal bone marrow (n = 6), bone marrow failure resulting from chemotherapy (n = 4), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5), and aplastic anemia (n = 5) were evaluated before and after patients were treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). This cytokine proved to be an effective hematopoietic growth factor with only mild side effects. The rhIL-3 treatment led to increased overall bone marrow cellularity with trilinear stimulation of hematopoietic cells, except in most patients with aplastic anemia. In all patients, significant eosinophilia and, in some instances, bone marrow fibrosis developed. In addition to the increase in the number of circulating neutrophilic granulocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes, an increase of peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes was observed. The histologic and cytologic findings support the concept that rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. It appears to be a safe and efficient therapeutic modality in patients with bone marrow failure. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine which patients will profit most from rhIL-3 treatment. 
2	Antibiotic use among children in an urban Brazilian slum: a risk factor for diarrhea? [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Apr;81(4):417] Among a cohort of children in a poor urban setting in Brazil, the relative risk for the occurrence of a new episode of diarrhea in the two weeks following antibiotic use vs all other weeks was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33, 2.45). Among children ever [corrected] exposed to antibiotics, the odds ratio was 1.34 (95% CI = 0.84, 2.16) after stratifying by individual child and controlling for previous diarrhea. Further research is needed to confirm whether antibiotics are a risk factor for diarrhea in such settings. 
4	Pharmacologic activity of bepafant (WEB 2170), a new and selective hetrazepinoic antagonist of platelet activating factor. The hetrazepine WEB 2170 (international nonproprietary name: bepafant), a thieno-triazolodiazepine that is structurally related to the recently described platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086, is a potent and selective PAF antagonist both in vitro and in vivo. WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced human platelet and neutrophil aggregation in vitro (IC50 values: 0.3 and 0.83 microM, respectively) but had little or no inhibitory action against aggregation induced by other agonists. The potency in vitro was comparable to that described recently for WEB 2086 (Casals-Stenzel, J., Muacevic, G. and Weber, K.H.: J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 241: 974-981, 1987). When guinea pigs were given i.v. infusions of PAF at 30 ng x kg-1 x min-1, oral (0.005-0.5 mg/kg) as well as intravenous (0.005-0.05 mg/kg) treatment with WEB 2170 abrogated the intrathoracic accumulation of 111In-labeled platelets, the bronchoconstriction and the hypotension as well as the finally occurring death in a dose-dependent fashion. Oral (0.01-1 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.005-0.1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 shared with the beta 2 agonist fenoterol and the steroid dexamethasone the property of protecting elderly NMRI mice from the lethal effect of PAF. In anesthetized rats, intravenous (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and oral (0.05-1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced hypotension in a dose-related manner. Coadministration of WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced increase of vascular permeability in rat skin very effectively. The half-time of duration of action in the rat was estimated to be about 5 to 6 h after oral administration and about 1.1 to 2.3 h after intravenous application. In conclusion, the hetrazepine WEB 2170 is a strong and selective PAF antagonist, which is in vitro more or less equipotent to WEB 2086. In contrast, in vivo oral WEB 2170 is--depending on the species and considered parameter--about 5 to 40 times more potent against exogenous PAF-induced alterations than the recently described hetrazepine WEB 2086. Particularly in mice and rats, oral WEB 2170 is by far superior to WEB 2086. 
1	Clonal origin of pituitary adenomas. As the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remains unclear, the tumor clonal composition of these common neoplasms was studied. Clonality was determined in female patients by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoglycerate kinase in conjunction with their respective methylation patterns. Peripheral lymphocyte DNA was screened from 62 female patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. Eleven patients were heterozygous for the BglI site on PGK, 4 for the BamHI site on HPRT, and 1 patient for both sites. Of these 16 patients, 3 had acromegaly, 4 had Cushing's disease, 7 had hyperprolactinemia, and 2 were clinically nonfunctional. After surgery, morphological study, including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the pathological specimens, allowed a direct comparison between clonality and tumor cell type. Control fresh normal pituitary tissue was found to be polyclonal. The following tumors were monoclonal: all 3 somatotroph adenomas, 4 of 4 lactotroph tumors, 3 of 4 corticotroph cell adenomas, a gonadotroph adenoma, and a nonsecretory adenoma. A mixed plurihormonal adenoma was polyclonal, as were 2 tumors consisting of adenomatous lactotrophs interspersed with nontumorous adenohypophyseal pituitary tissue and one corticotroph adenoma mixed with normal pituitary tissue. Functional pituitary adenomas derived from somatotrophs, corticotrophs, or lactotrophs and nonsecretory tumors are monoclonal in nature, suggesting that somatic cell mutations precede clonal expansion of these cells and play a major role in pituitary tumorigenesis. 
3	In vivo leukocyte migration in arthritis. We quantitated in vivo migration of neutrophils into the knees of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis, using 99mtechnetium-hexamethyl-propylene-amineoxime-labeled leukocytes and gamma scintigraphy. Significant neutrophil migration occurred in patients with RA irrespective of disease duration, and it was reduced by 60% following intraarticular steroid injection. The reduction in neutrophil migration correlated with reduction in pain. Leukocyte migration into osteoarthritic joints was also demonstrated, although it was much less than that seen in rheumatoid joints. No significant leukocyte migration into the joints of patients without arthritis was demonstrated. This technique appears to provide a sensitive method for quantitatively assessing the neutrophil component of inflammation in individual joints of patients with arthritis. 
5	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with high-dose intravenous gamma globulin. Plasma infusion and/or plasma exchange has become standard therapy in the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The management of patients in whom such primary therapy fails is difficult and uncertain. We have described a patient who obtained a sustained remission with the use of high-dose IV gamma globulin after an initial response to aggressive plasma exchange was followed by prompt relapse. Our case and others suggest that high-dose IV IgG may induce remission in patients with TTP who do not respond to standard plasma infusion and/or exchange. 
3	Childhood stroke after minor neck trauma: case report. Cerebral infarction after minor trauma to the neck has rarely been reported. A case is presented of a child with trauma to the vertebrobasilar artery resulting in stroke. Computerized tomography scan and angiography results are presented. Despite two subsequent, separate transient episodes of vertigo, the child had good functional recovery with complete restoration of language and cognitive function. After 28 months, residual impairments identified were a mild right-sided ataxia and hemiparesis. 
3	Profound papilledema due to cryptococcal meningitis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: successful treatment with fluconazole. Although cryptococcal meningitis is a frequent infection in patients with AIDS, papilledema is rarely reported. We have reported a case of profound papilledema associated with cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with AIDS. After treatment failure with amphotericin B, the patient was successfully treated with fluconazole, and the papilledema resolved. 
3	Efficacy and complications of radiotherapy of anterior visual pathway tumors. A progressive disturbance in visual acuity or visual field, along with an unexplained optic nerve atrophy, suggests the possibility of a tumor. Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas. The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system. Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases. This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications. Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented. 
4	Efficacy of transesophageal echocardiography as a perioperative monitor in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Analysis of 149 consecutive studies. To evaluate the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography as a perioperative monitor in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, 149 consecutive patients were studied since 1985. Left ventricular function was assessed by measurement of left ventricular dimension and ejection fraction in patients with valvular disease. This monitoring was useful in detecting the changes in left ventricular performance in patients with volume overload and in managing patients in the early postoperative period. Cardiac tamponade was clearly demonstrated before changes in electrocardiogram and hemodynamic data. In 27 patients, transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was used to confirm that there was no residual regurgitation immediately after valvular reconstructive surgery. Transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was also useful in detecting the entry of false lumen before surgery in 7 patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm. There were no unsuccessful introductions, no traumatic or thermal injuries, 18 patients (12.1%) with hoarseness and 5 patients (3.4%) with transient arrhythmia. In conclusion, transesophageal echocardiography provides a good imaging window to the heart and great vessels perioperatively. This expedient, safe informative imaging method can be used more routinely in patients during surgery. 
1	Psychological outcomes of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer outside a clinical trial OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial. 
5	Toxic carbamazepine concentrations following cardiothoracic surgery and myocardial infarction. Carbamazepine is being used more frequently in the U.S. as an initial agent of choice to treat generalized tonic-clonic, mixed, and partial seizures with complex symptomatology. Carbamazepine is extensively metabolized in the liver; however, there is little information available on its pharmacokinetics in patients following surgery or myocardial infarction, or in those with liver disease. We report a case of a patient who attained toxic carbamazepine serum concentrations (ranging from 18.2 to 21.5 micrograms/mL) two days after cardiothoracic surgery and an intraoperative myocardial infarction, and experienced lethargy, diplopia, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and horizontal and downgaze nystagmus. These alterations in serum carbamazepine concentration normalized ten days after surgery. They may have been due to a combination of changes in protein binding and decreased elimination due to altered intrinsic hepatic clearance. With carbamazepine achieving a more prominent place in anticonvulsant therapy, the influence of various procedures and disease processes on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of carbamazepine, as well as the clinical consequences of such changes, need further investigation. 
4	The natural history of peripheral vascular disease. Implications for its management. The durability and the eventual complication rate of endovascular therapy (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, laser-assisted angioplasty, and atherectomy) are not yet entirely clear, especially with respect to the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions in the femoropopliteal or distal arterial segments. Therefore, the indications for its use have not been firmly established and must take into consideration the natural history of the occlusive disease itself. Although some type of procedural intervention clearly is warranted in the presence of ischemic rest pain or tissue necrosis, intermittent claudication is the only complaint in approximately 70% of patients who present with either aortoiliac or femoropopliteal involvement. Most nondiabetic patients experience substantial symptomatic improvement with a daily exercise program, and their long-term risks for either abrupt deterioration (20-25%) or amputation (less than 10%) are relatively low. In comparison, the 5-year mortality rate ranges from 20-40% even in claudicants, and as many as 40% of those with clinical indications of associated coronary artery disease have been shown angiographically to be candidates for myocardial revascularization. These observations suggest that traditional indications for surgical treatment (truly disabling claudication and/or limb salvage) also should be applied to endovascular therapy until its success is confirmed beyond speculation, and that incidental coronary disease deserves particular attention in patients with lower extremity ischemia. 
1	Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. 
5	Endolymphatic hydrops precipitated by haemodialysis. We report a case of endolymphatic hydrops preceded by haemodialysis in the contralateral ear of a patient with known Meniere's disease, and discuss the possible mechanism. It is suggested that the sudden decrease of plasma osmolality during haemodialysis acts as a reverse glycerol test. The audiometric and electrophysiological recordings pre- and post-dialysis and the induction of the Meniere's triad of symptoms during dialysis, were strongly indicative of the presence of endolymphatic hydrops. 
5	Effect of chemodenervation on the cerebral vascular and microvascular response to hypoxia. This study evaluated the effect of bilateral carotid chemodenervation on the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia in conscious rats. Cerebral blood flow was measured using 4-iodo[N-methyl-14C]antipyrine, and the total and perfused microvasculature was studied by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and alkaline phosphatase staining. To maintain constant PCO2, hypoxia was achieved in chemoreceptor-intact rats by the use of 4% CO2-8% O2-88% N2 and in chemodenervated rats by the administration of 8% O2-92% N2. Blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were similar in the two groups of rats. Chemodenervation had no significant effect on either resting blood flow or the perfused microvasculature during normoxia. A significant increase in cerebral blood flow (from 71 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g in control and from 91 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g in chemodenervated rats) and in the percent of cerebral arterioles and capillaries perfused occurred in both hypoxic control and chemodenervated rats. In chemoreceptor-intact rats, the greatest increase in blood flow and in perfused microvasculature occurred in caudal structures (medulla and pons) in comparison with rostral structures (cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus). In chemodenervated rats, a similar increase in blood flow and perfused microvasculature occurred in all brain regions, with no regional differences. Thus, chemodenervation did not affect the overall cerebral blood flow or the microvascular response to hypoxia; however, rostral-to-caudal regional differences in the hypoxic response were lost after chemodenervation. 
1	Drug-induced DNA damage and tumor chemosensitivity. Cytotoxic drugs act principally by damaging tumor-cell DNA. Quantitative analysis of this interaction provides a basis for understanding the biology of therapeutic cell kill as well as a rational strategy for optimizing and predicting tumor response. Recent advances have made it possible to correlate assayed DNA lesions with cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines, in animal models, and in patients with malignant disease. In addition, many of the complex interrelationships between DNA damage, DNA repair, and alterations of gene expression in response to DNA damage have been defined. Techniques for modulating DNA damage and cytotoxicity using schedule-specific cytotoxic combinations, DNA repair inhibitors, cell-cycle manipulations, and adjunctive noncytotoxic drug therapy are being developed, and critical therapeutic targets have been identified within tumor-cell subpopulations and genomic DNA alike. Most importantly, methods for predicting clinical response to cytotoxic therapy using both in vitro markers of tumor-cell sensitivity and in vivo measurements of drug-induced DNA damage are now becoming a reality. These advances can be expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of innovative cytotoxic drug strategies over the next decade. 
1	Specific binding sites for insulin-like growth factor I in the ovarian stroma of women with polycystic ovarian disease and stromal hyperthecosis. Women with polycystic ovarian disease and hyperthecosis have hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. It is possible that insulin in supraphysiologic concentration exerts its steroidogenic action on ovarian stromal cells through insulin-like growth factor I receptors. We undertook this study to investigate whether the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis has specific binding sites for insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. Ovarian stromal tissue was obtained from seven women with normal ovulatory cycles and from five women with hyperthecosis of the ovaries. Binding studies with insulin tagged with iodine 125 and insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 revealed specific binding sites both for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I in the ovarian stroma. The binding of insulin tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis (3.4% +/- 1.1% (+/- SE) per 100 micrograms protein) was significantly (p less than 0.04) lower than that observed in normal premenopausal women (8.3% +/- 1.6% per 100 micrograms protein). By contrast, the specific binding of insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis (7.1% +/- 1.7% per 100 micrograms protein) was higher than that observed in the ovarian stroma from normal women (4.5% +/- 1.7% per 100 micrograms protein), although the difference was not statistically significant. The affinity constants for these high-affinity receptors were similar (1.2 to 3.6 x 10(9) L/mol) in the two groups of women. These results indicate that (1) the ovarian stroma has specific binding sites both for insulin and for insulin-like growth factor I; (2) in women with hyperthecosis, the ovarian stroma has decreased binding sites for insulin but has normal concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I receptors; and (3) in women with hyperthecosis, stimulation of ovarian androgen synthesis by insulin may be mediated through the insulin-like growth factor I receptors. 
5	Some osseous and soft tissue causes of human intervertebral canal (foramen) stenosis. Much attention has been paid to the causes of vertebral canal stenosis in humans but relatively little has been documented with regard to intervertebral canal (intervertebral "foramen," lateral spinal canal, nerve root canal) stenosis. As the dural sleeve ends at the outer opening of the intervertebral canal, a false "normal" myelogram is possible when a space occupying lesion occurs beyond the subarachnoid space. Also, if stenosis affects only vascular structures, compression of these structures cannot be noted during myelography, so venous stasis may be overlooked. Our cadaveric study investigates some causes of intervertebral canal stenosis due to encroachment by bony and soft tissue structures, and low magnification photomicrographs are used to illustrate some causes of stenosis. 
5	The growing teratoma syndrome. Thirteen patients with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumours and enlarging metastases consisting of teratoma differentiated only were identified. Patients were managed with surgical resection soon after the growing lesions were documented. Surgical morbidity was minimal and 12 patients are alive (10 are disease-free) at a median follow-up of 28 months. 
3	Diagnostic and prognostic value of electrophysiologic tests in meralgia paresthetica. Electrophysiologic diagnosis of unilateral meralgia paresthetica is usually assessed by side-to-side comparison of SNAP amplitudes, SNCVs, and SEP latencies following stimulation of lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. To determine the relevance for diagnosis of these tests and side-to-side comparison, the results were compared in patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica and normal subjects. The long-term outcome was also considered, in order to determine whether electrophysiologic findings contribute to the prognosis. In our study, SNAP amplitude comparison was found to be more useful for diagnosis than SNCV and SEP latency comparisons. However the value of the SNAP amplitude on the affected side, just as the results of the other tests, was not found to be predictive of the outcome. Also the results of the tests depend on the methods used and on the nerve's route. 
5	Does use of gastroepiploic artery graft increase surgical risk? Seventy patients in whom the gastroepiploic artery was used for coronary artery bypass grafting were compared with 70 patients in whom the gastroepiploic artery was not used. Mean age was 56.8 years in the group in which this artery was used and 61.8 years in the group in which it was not (p less than 0.001). All other preoperative characteristics including number of women, extent of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and preoperative left ventricular function were not significantly different between the two groups. An internal mammary artery graft was concomitantly used in 68 patients (97%) of the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in 61 patients (87%) without such a graft. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3.3 and 3.4, aortic crossclamp time was 65.3 +/- 19.9 minutes and 54.0 +/- 20.1 minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 114.8 +/- 23.6 minutes and 112.9 +/- 25.0 minutes, respectively, in the groups with and without a gastroepiploic artery graft. Only aortic crossclamp time was significantly (p less than 0.05) longer in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft. There were two (2.9%) early deaths and two (2.9%) new Q-wave infarctions in both groups. Intraaortic balloon pumping was required in five patients (7.1%) in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in three patients (4.3%) without this graft. Postoperative complications were similar and rare in both groups. Intraoperative endoscopic laser Doppler study demonstrated no significant change of gastric mucosal blood flow before and after division of the gastroepiploic artery. We concluded that there is no additional risk in the use of the gastroepiploic artery for coronary bypass grafting, and a favorable outcome can be expected. 
4	Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. 
1	Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor with very high serum human chorionic gonadotropin. Most patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) have an excellent prognosis with modern chemotherapy, although certain subgroups with a worse prognosis have been described. One such subgroup includes patients with high serum levels of the tumor marker, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Sixteen patients of 104 treated for NSGCT at the CRC Wessex Medical Oncology Unit (Southampton, UK) presented with serum HCG greater than 25,000. Most of these patients exhibited features of the "choriocarcinoma syndrome" with bulky, rapidly progressive disease; frequent pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous system complications; and a generally poorer response to standard NSGCT chemotherapy. Histologic identification of trophoblastic tumor was not made in all patients and is not essential for the diagnosis of the syndrome; indeed, closed biopsy may be contradicted in some circumstances because of the risk of hemorrhage. The NSGCT patients with poor prognosis, including patients with the choriocarcinoma syndrome, must be clearly identified in order to improve management and, eventually, cure rates. 
4	Immunohistochemical study of vascular lesions in severe hypertension induced by DOCA and salt administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In order to evaluate whether immunoglobulin deposition in vessels plays some role in the development of vascular lesions in severe hypertension, an immunohistochemical study was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), to which deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and salt were administered. DOCA and salt rapidly induced severe hypertensive vascular lesions, including necrotizing arteriolitis and productive endarteritis. In these rats, considerable deposits of IgG and IgM were found in the small arteries and arterioles of the kidneys. These deposits were accompanied by complement (C3), and could be eluted by acid incubation. They were localized in periodic acid-Schiff-positive insudative lesions, which were thought to be an early phase of the hypertensive vascular lesions. These results suggest that the immunoglobulins might be bound to an unknown antigen in the vascular lesions and that some immunological mechanism mediated by the immunoglobulins is involved in the development of vascular lesions in severe hypertension. 
1	Function after amputation, arthrodesis, or arthroplasty for tumors about the knee. We studied the function of twenty-two patients who had had a malignant skeletal tumor adjacent to the knee. An above-the-knee amputation was done in seven; a resection arthrodesis, in nine; and a replacement arthroplasty, in six. The patients all walked at a similar speed (sixty-one to sixty-six meters per minute), which is slower than normal (eighty meters per minute). They all walked with comparable efficiency at three velocities: the mean consumption of oxygen was 0.210 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter at free velocity, 0.215 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 25 per cent faster, and 0.211 to 0.240 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 50 per cent faster. The three groups of patients and a normal control group consumed oxygen at similar rates. The patients who had had an amputation were very active, and they were the least worried about damaging the affected limb, but they had difficulty walking on steep, rough, or slippery surfaces. The patients who had had an arthrodesis had a more stable limb and performed the most demanding physical work and recreational activities, but they had difficulty sitting. The patients who had had an arthroplasty led sedentary lives and were the most protective of the limb, but they were the least self-conscious about the limb. 
1	Extramedullary blast crisis in a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission. Treatment of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-A) results in complete disappearance of the Ph chromosome in about 10% to 15% of patients in early chronic phase. This group has a long survival and very low incidence of blast crisis. The first known case is reported of extramedullary blastic transformation in a patient with medullary complete cytogenetic response (0% Ph-positive metaphases) to IFN-A. Four episodes of extramedullary blast crisis have occurred in this patient. The first three episodes were lymphoid by morphology and cytochemical stains. Molecular analysis confirmed breakpoint cluster region rearrangement. The most recent transformation was myeloid in nature and involved bone and pulmonary parenchyma. The patient is currently undergoing a second autologous transplantation with stored bone marrow that is Ph negative. The patient has survived more than 18 months since the first episode of blast crisis, and the bone marrow is normal. 
2	Ischemic colitis in a crack abuser. We report a case of acute colitis temporally associated with smoking crack. Colonoscopy revealed a patchy left-sided hemorrhagic inflammation from the rectosigmoid colon to the splenic flexure. Biopsy specimens were consistent with resolving ischemic colitis. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bloody diarrhea in recreational drug users. 
5	Measurement of acute phase proteins for assessing severity of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Seventeen adult patients with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria, admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, were studied. Serial measurements of the serum concentration of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, and percentage parasitaemia were determined, together with initial measurement of serum electrolytes, liver function, haemoglobin, white cell and platelet counts. Initial C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations were increased (C-reactive protein mean 49.0 mg/l serum amyloid A 28 mg/l) falling towards the normal range by the seventh day of treatment. There was a significant correlation between the pretreatment parasite count and clinical and laboratory markers of inflammation. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations correlated inversely with the serum sodium. These results indicate that measurement of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A may prove valuable in assessing the severity of P falciparum malaria, and in following the response to antimalarial treatment. 
2	Carbohydrate malabsorption. Its measurement and its contribution to diarrhea. The major purpose of this research was to gain insight into the effect of carbohydrate malabsorption on fecal water output. To do this we measured daily fecal output of total carbohydrate, reducing sugars, and organic acids (a product of bacterial fermentation). Normal subjects were studied in their native state and when diarrhea was induced by mechanisms that did and did not involve carbohydrate malabsorption. Patients with malabsorption syndrome were also studied. We concluded that: (a) Excretion of carbohydrate and its breakdown products can be expressed as a single number by converting organic acids to their monosaccharide equivalents. (b) Diarrhea per se causes only a trivial increase in fecal carbohydrate excretion. (c) The molar output of osmotic moieties in feces due to unabsorbed carbohydrate can be determined by adding fecal reducing sugars to organic acids and their obligated cations. This expression parallels almost exactly the effect of increasing doses of lactulose (a nonabsorbable sugar) on fecal water output; one excreted millimole obligates 3.5 g of stool water. This relationship can be used to predict the effect of carbohydrate malabsorption on stool water output in patients with diarrhea. (d) 12 of 19 patients with malabsorption syndrome due to various diseases had excessive fecal excretion of carbohydrate and its breakdown products; of the diseases that cause malabsorption syndrome, combined small and large bowel resection is most likely to result in excessive fecal excretion of carbohydrate and monosaccharide equivalents. In 6 of these 19 patients carbohydrate malabsorption appeared to be the major cause of diarrhea. 
4	Focal scleroderma and severe cardiomyopathy. Patient report and brief review. A 21-month-old infant presented with simultaneous localized scleroderma and severe cardiomyopathy with heart failure. Cardiac abnormalities and serological changes (positive rheumatoid factor assay, elevated IgM and IgG levels, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate) reverted to normal with prednisone therapy, and there was substantial, though incomplete, resolution of her skin changes during the same period. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with definite, clinically significant cardiac involvement associated with focal scleroderma. The possibility of internal organ involvement, including cardiac involvement, must be considered with focal scleroderma as well as with progressive systemic sclerosis. 
4	Red cell Na+/Li+ countertransport in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with diabetic nephropathy. Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension, as indicated by increased maximal velocity of Na+/Li+ countertransport in red cells, has been suggested as a marker for the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. To evaluate the validity of this concept in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, we measured the maximal velocity of Na+/Li+ countertransport in red cells in 18 male diabetics suffering from proteinuria due to biopsy proven diabetic glomerulosclerosis (GFR: 51 [range 27 to 146] ml/min/1.73 m2), 17 male diabetics with normoalbuminuria, and in 18 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy control subjects. Na+/Li+ countertransport was identical in patients with and without diabetic nephropathy, 0.43 (0.24 to 0.92) versus 0.44 (0.20 to 0.83) mmol/(liter cells x hr), but was elevated compared to control subjects, 0.32 (0.09 to 0.73; P less than 0.05). Arterial blood pressure was elevated in patients with nephropathy (162/92 +/- 21/9 mm Hg) compared to normoalbuminuric patients (132/82 +/- 15/7) and control subjects (133/83 +/- 14/7 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). Our study does not support the hypothesis that the risk of diabetic nephropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Diabetes per se seems to enhance Na+/Li+ countertransport activity. 
1	Extramedullary hematopoiesis in a bronchial carcinoid tumor. An unusual complication of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A case of bronchial carcinoid tumor with foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis is presented. The patient had a 6-year history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and hepatosplenomegaly. All three hematopoietic cell lines were represented in different areas of the bronchial tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first case of extramedullary hematopoiesis described in a bronchial carcinoid and only the fourth report of hematopoietic cells in a neoplasm of otherwise unrelated origin. The pathogenesis of this uncommon finding is discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
4	Production of thrombi on intact endothelium by use of antiheparin agents in vivo. It had been suggested that antithrombin activity on the surface of intact endothelial cells may play a role in inhibiting platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. The antithrombin activity may be due to thrombomodulin or to activation of antithrombin III by glycosaminoglycans or thrombomodulin, or possibly a combination of these. This inhibitory activity has been shown to be affected by such antiheparin agents as protamine, hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene; Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) and platelet factor 4, as well as by such enzymes as heparinase and heparitinase. We have used a hamster cheek pouch preparation to observe thrombus formation in vivo in a normal vascular flow, to determine whether the production of thrombi by thrombin can be enhanced by antiheparin agents. After intra-arterial injection or topical application of protamine or hexadimethrine bromide, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on intact arteriolar endothelium was produced by a dose of thrombin, which when injected alone had no effect. No thrombi were found in venules or capillaries. Injection of heparin before or after the antiheparin agents necessitated a larger dose to enhance the action of thrombin. On electron microscopy the thrombi were found to consist primarily of platelets adherent to an intact endothelium. The possible clinical implications of these observations are discussed. 
5	Concordance for dyslipidemic hypertension in male twins. Sixty cases of dyslipidemic hypertension were identified in the 1028 middle-aged, white, male twin participants in the first examination of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study (1969 to 1973). The prevalence of dyslipidemic hypertension was similar by zygosity but proband concordance was three times greater in monozygotic than dizygotic twins (0.44 [seven concordant and 18 discordant pairs] vs 0.14 [two concordant and 24 discordant pairs]), suggesting a genetic effect on the condition. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was the most common lipid abnormality in concordant pairs. Mortality from ischemic heart disease was significantly higher in individuals with dyslipidemic hypertension. Obesity and glucose intolerance were closely associated with the syndrome. Moreover, within the 18 discordant monozygotic twin pairs, the twins with dyslipidemic hypertension had gained significantly more weight as adults and were significantly heavier than their unaffected cotwins. Thus, although genetic factors may influence development of dyslipidemic hypertension, nongenetic, potentially modifiable aspects of obesity are also closely related to expression of this clinically important syndrome. 
1	Pharmacodynamics in cancer therapy. Our understanding of anticancer pharmacodynamics, and the relationships between pharmacologic measurements and clinical effects, has grown markedly in recent years due to advances in analytical and computational technology. Although methotrexate plasma levels have been empirically used to guide leucovorin dosing during high-dose methotrexate therapy, there has been no other standard use of therapeutic drug monitoring in oncology. More recently, investigators have attempted to titrate precisely the dose of antineoplastic agents based on previously derived models and real-time analysis of plasma drug or tissue concentrations. Studies have been completed or are in progress using hexamethylene bisacetamide, etoposide, teniposide, fluorouracil (FUra), and cytarabine (ara-C). Future studies will focus on optimal sampling strategies, analysis of intermediate biochemical end points, combination chemotherapy, modulation by colony-stimulating factors, and more sophisticated pharmacodynamic models. 
1	Cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can now be made with greater rapidity and accuracy. In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree. The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography. If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable. These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma. In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated. As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection. Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion. Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting. However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression. Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival. 
5	Vasopressin response in collecting ducts of rats resistant to mineralocorticoid hypertension. In previous studies we found that vasopressin stimulation of both cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in cortical collecting tubules (CCT) and sodium reabsorption in isolated perfused kidneys was markedly exaggerated in rats with mineralocorticoid hypertension. In the present study, we tested the response (cAMP accumulation) of cortical and outer medullary collecting tubules (OMCT) to vasopressin in two rat models that are resistant to deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-induced hypertension, the Wistar-Furth strain and NaCl-deficient rats. The blood pressure of normal outbred Wistar rats rose to hypertensive levels (systolic pressure more than 165 mm Hg) during a 5-week treatment with DOCA (10 mg/week) and 1% saline to drink. Significant hypertrophy of the heart and kidneys was also observed. Vasopressin (10(-8) M)-induced cAMP formation was enhanced 3.4-fold in the CCT (OMCT unchanged) of hypertensive rats compared with normotensive controls. Significant hypertrophy (as indexed by tubule diameter) of the CCT but not the OMCT was also observed in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Restriction of dietary NaCl (0.13% in chow, tap water to drink) completely prevented DOCA-induced hypertension, organ and CCT hypertrophy, and enhancement of vasopressin-stimulated cAMP formation in the CCT. In Wistar-Furth rats, DOCA-salt treatment did not alter blood pressure or cause significant organ hypertrophy. However, DOCA-salt treatment enhanced vasopressin-stimulated cAMP formation by 4.1-fold in CCT of Wistar-Furth rats, with significant tubular hypertrophy in the CCT but not the OMCT. We conclude that DOCA-induced hypertension and changes in CCT function are dependent on excess dietary NaCl. 
1	Management of patients with thyroid carcinoma: application of thallium-201 scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging Thyroid carcinoma has the ability to concentrate radioiodine, an attribute that can be used both for detection of thyroid cells and for treatment. Unfortunately, however, radioiodine uptake is not observed in all patients and a radioiodine scan requires that the patient be rendered hypothyroid for 4-6 wk. In the present study, we analyzed the utility of thallium-201 scanning and the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of thyroid cancer. Nineteen patients with thyroid cancer had a total of 24 radioiodine scans, 33 thallium scans, and 10 MRI examinations. Of the 19 patients in the study, 17 had differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In these 17 cases, all paired studies were concordant for the presence (n = 7) or absence (n = 10) of disease. However, in one case (Patient 10), the 201Tl studies showed far more extensive disease than was observed on the 131I scan. Thyroid cancer was also detected on seven MRI studies. In summary, thallium and MRI scans are adjunctive techniques to radioiodine scanning that can either confirm the presence of neck bed activity, residual disease or metastatic cancer and may delineate tumor deposits not detected by radioiodine scanning. Thallium may be capable of detecting tumor deposits even while a patient remains euthyroid. 
4	Early diagnosis and surgical intervention of acute aortic dissection by transesophageal color flow mapping. To determine whether transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography (TEE) is useful for the early diagnosis and surgical intervention in acute aortic dissection, 57 serial patients with acute aortic dissection were examined. These patients were evaluated by TEE with either the single-plane probe (39 patients) or the biplanar probe (18 patients) just after admission. The intimal flap was detected in all patients, and there were 18 patients with type A dissection and 39 patients with type B dissection. The entry was visualized in 83% of type A dissection cases and in 90% of type B dissection cases. In two of 18 patients examined with the biplanar probe technique, the entry was detected in the longitudinal view only. Emergency operations were performed in 18 patients with type A dissection and in 10 patients with ruptured type B dissection. Twenty-nine of 39 patients with type B dissection were treated conservatively. The operative mortality rate of patients with type A dissection was 22%, and that of patients with ruptured type B dissection was 60%. The major advantage of TEE is its ease of application at the bedside or in the operating room, which allows immediate and accurate diagnosis of acute aortic dissection for emergency surgical intervention. Biplanar TEE provides additional acoustic windows, ease of spatial orientation, and more accurate visualization of entry. TEE is a useful and powerful diagnostic tool for acute aortic dissection, and by using this method, one may achieve a more rapid and aggressive surgical approach for patients with acute aortic dissection. 
5	Outcome of pregnancies experienced during residency. To investigate potential adverse effects of residency training on pregnancy outcome, a cohort study was conducted among 45 university-affiliated residency programs. Outcomes of the first pregnancy experienced during residency were compared between 92 female residents and 144 spouses of male residents. Despite long hours, sleep deprivation, and an increase in perceived stress, the female residents were as likely to give birth to a live, full-term newborn as the spouses of male residents. For white cohort members, an increased risk of premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity, spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents is a cause for concern and should be further investigated. 
5	The infant with a reddish diaper. The infant with a reddish diaper presents a diagnostic challenge to the primary care physician. As described by Dr Baumgardner, the cause may be benign, but more ominous disorders must be ruled out. 
4	Management of hypertension by reduction in sympathetic activity. The sympathetic nervous system may initiate or maintain hypertension, and a range of approaches that reduce sympathetic activity is often of value in management. These may include nonpharmacological methods, such as the various forms of behavioral therapy (e.g., meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback techniques); weight reduction and avoidance of particular foods and agents that stimulate sympathetic activity (including caffeine and alcohol), and regular physical exercise. Pharmacological therapy includes centrally acting drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and reserpine; ganglionic blockers such as hexamethonium; agents acting on sympathetic nerve terminals such as guanethidine and debrisoquine; and drugs that may act at multiple sites, such as the beta-adrenergic blockers. The role of reducing sympathetic activity in the current management of hypertension and its complications is considered in this overview. 
5	Venous hemodynamics in a chronic venous valvular insufficiency model. To develop a large-animal model of chronic venous valve incompetence, 13 greyhound dogs underwent unilateral hindlimb venous valve lysis with a valve cutter apparatus pulled retrograde through the iliac, femoral, and lateral saphenous veins. Bilateral venous pressures in the lateral saphenous vein were recorded before valve lysis, immediately after valve lysis, and at intervals from 1 to 14 weeks after valve lysis, with the dogs in the supine position and elevated 80 degrees semierect, as well as after stimulated hindlimb muscle contraction to empty the hindlimb veins. Passive venous filling time with elevation and 90% venous refilling time after muscle contraction were calculated. From immediately after through 14 weeks after valve lysis, a shortened venous filling time and 90% venous refilling time as well as an elevated poststimulation venous pressure were noted. This valve lysis method successfully produced a hemodynamically verified model of venous valvular insufficiency. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (L-tryptophan-associated neuromyopathy). Histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy in a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome following L-tryptophan use showed prominent lymphocytic perineuritis, neuritis, and perimysial fasciitis. The presence of perineuritis and neuritis provides a histopathologic basis for clinical features of neuropathy in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and occurred in conjunction with a fasciitis or interstitial myositis that was predominantly perimysial and focally endomysial. 
4	An analysis of outcome following percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty. An autopsy series. We analyzed autopsy findings on 26 patients who died following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Twenty-one patients died within 3 weeks of undergoing PTCA; demonstrable cardiac complications were found in 19 patients: platelet-fibrin thrombi (10 patients [48%]), coronary artery dissections (17 patients [81%]), thromboemboli (13 patients [62%]), atheroemboli (seven patients [33%]), and myocardial infarcts (17 patients [81%]). An increased incidence of coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi was noted when compared with a non-PTCA cardiac autopsy population (five of 53 patients). Apparently there was an increased incidence of coronary atheroemboli and thromboemboli in the patients with coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi (eight patients) when compared with patients who did not have platelet-fibrin thrombi (five patients), although this was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of a systemic hypercoagulable state or of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The pathogenesis of this is unclear; however, vasospasm and a disruption of the endothelial surface induced by PTCA with subsequent platelet activation are possible causes. Although not statistically significant, there was a proponderance of female subjects (seven patients) and an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (six patients) and hypertension (13 patients) when compared with a control population of all patients undergoing PTCA at The Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation in 1987, suggesting that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female sex may be clinical risk factors for fatal complications following PTCA. 
2	What affects continence after anterior resection of the rectum? Functional results after anterior rectal resections are commonly considered satisfactory but variable percentages of postoperative incontinence are often reported. Continence was evaluated after 20 low anterior resections (LAR) and 13 high anterior resections (HAR) by means of clinical assessment, anorectal manometry, and evacuation proctography. Whereas all HAR patients had perfect continence, 10 patients (50 percent of the LAR group had occasional episodes of soiling from liquid feces, 5 patients (25 percent had frequent soiling or occasional incontinence for solid feces, and 1 patient (5 percent had frequent solid stool loss requiring surgical treatment. Anal canal resting pressure at 3 and 4 cm from the anal verge was significantly lower in the LAR group (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05, respectively) than in the HAR group. However, the maximum voluntary contraction did not differ between the two groups. Rectoanal inhibitory reflex was found to be present in 17 of the 20 patients with LAR and in all patients with HAR. The volume at which the anal sphincter is continuously inhibited was significantly reduced in the LAR group (P less than 0.001). Also, the conscious rectal sensibility volumes were found to be significantly reduced for threshold, constant, and maximum tolerated volume. Threshold volume for internal sphincter relaxation was lower than the threshold volume for rectal sensation in some patients with LAR. This could allow postoperative fecal soiling. Rectal compliance was decreased (P less than 0.001) in the LAR group. Evacuation proctography, performed in six LAR patients affected by major soiling or solid stool loss, revealed an abnormal obtuse anorectal angle and pathologic lowering of the perineum at rest and during defecation. The concomitance of internal and sphincter impairment, reduction in rectal compliance, and previous pelvis floor muscle damage are postulated as cause affecting continence in patients who underwent LAR. 
3	Intestinal permeability in patients with chronic urticaria-angioedema with and without arthralgia. We evaluated the clinical response to oligoallergenic dietary treatment and the intestinal absorption of a protein antigen, cow milk beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) in 24 patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema syndrome 13 of whom also suffered from joint symptoms. Sixteen patients (77% of those with arthralgia) responded to diet (RD) with marked reduction of symptoms; the others did not respond (NR). Ten (all but one RD with arthralgia) had increased permeability to BLG after oral administration of cow milk. Four with high titers of IgG to BLG showed the highest absorption of BLG and the groups with arthralgia showed higher BLG levels than those without arthralgia. In all cases, specific IgE to cow milk was absent. These data suggest that the symptoms of a subgroup of patients with chronic urticaria, and especially patients with joint complaints that subside with diet, are related to excess intestinal permeability. The measurement of gut permeability to food proteins may be useful to define those who may benefit from dietary restriction. 
5	Candidal infection in oral lichen planus. The prevalence of candidal infection in lichen planus (LP) and its possible association with ulceration were independently examined in two archived series of 108 and 77 cases derived from two separate populations. To ensure that similar material was being compared, each case was histopathologically reassessed and confirmed as LP or reclassified as nonspecific lichenoid stomatitis (NSLS), lichenoid dysplasia (LD), or other (O). Three further sections, cut at 25 microns intervals, were stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent for the identification of intraepithelial candidal pseudohyphae. As control specimens, 61 normal and 59 hyperkeratotic mucosal samples were similarly processed and examined. Candidal infection was found in 17.4% and 16.4% of ulcerated and nonulcerated LP cases, respectively, and in 40.0% and 16.7% of ulcerated and nonulcerated NSLS cases, respectively. One case of LD was infected. Each control series contained one infected case. The results indicate that candidal infection occurs more readily in LP and NSLS, with no apparent association with ulceration in LP. The comparatively marked increase in the infection prevalence of ulcerated NSLS cannot be statistically confirmed, and its significance remains uncertain. 
5	Role of cephamycins in obstetrics and gynecology. Infections of the female upper genital tract are usually polymicrobic, often involving mixed aerobic (facultative) and anaerobic bacteria. Optimal therapy provides coverage against aerobes (both gram positive and gram negative and especially the Enterobacteriaceae) and anaerobes (especially the beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative species, such as Bacteroides). A variety of antibiotics provide the broad spectrum of activity needed for these infections, including clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside, cephalosporins and cephamycins, imipenem, extended-spectrum penicillins and the beta-lactam agents combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The cephamycins--cefoxitin, cefotetan and cefmetazole--have been shown to have a high rate of clinical efficacy and bacteriologic response. The cephalosporins are usually used for prophylaxis at the time of obstetric and gynecologic surgery. The cephamycins have recently undergone extensive evaluation for prophylaxis and have demonstrated comparable microbiologic and clinical efficacy. A pharmacokinetic comparison of cefoxitin, cefotetan and cefmetazole points to cefmetazole as a cost-effective alternative to cefoxitin and cefotetan for both prophylaxis and treatment of pelvic infections. 
5	Role of xanthine oxidase and neutrophils in ischemia-reperfusion injury in rabbit lung. This study evaluated the effect of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) on pulmonary capillary permeability in isolated rabbit lungs and the roles of xanthine oxidase (XO), aldehyde oxidase (AO), and neutrophils (PMN) in producing this lung injury. Effects of XO and AO were studied by inactivation with a tungsten-enriched diet (0.7 g/kg) and inhibition of XO by allopurinol (100 microM) or AO by menadione (3.5 microM). PMN effects were studied by preventing endothelial adhesion with the monoclonal antibody IB4 (10 microM). Vascular permeability was evaluated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) measured before and after I-R in all experimental conditions. Reperfusion after 2 h of ischemia significantly increased pulmonary capillary permeability (Kf,c changed from 0.096 +/- 0.014 to 0.213 +/- 0.025 ml.min-1. cmH2O-1.100 g-1), and this increase was blocked by the addition of catalase (50,000 U) at reperfusion (baseline Kf,c was 0.125 +/- 0.023 and 0.116 +/- 0.014 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). XO inactivation with the tungsten-supplemented diet and XO inhibition with allopurinol prevented the Kf,c increase observed after I-R (0.183 +/- 0.030 to 0.185 +/- 0.033 and 0.126 +/- 0.018 to 0.103 +/- 0.005 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). Inhibition of AO had no effect on I-R injury (Kf,c 0.108 +/- 0.011 to 0.167 +/- 0.014 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). Preventing PMN adhesion resulted in significant attenuation of the change in Kf,c associated with I-R (0.112 +/- 0.032 to 0.090 +/- 0.065 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1). We conclude that XO and PMN adherence, but not AO, are involved in the increased capillary permeability associated with I-R. 
4	Effect of stress on diagnosis of hypertension. Blood pressure assessment by a physician elicits an alerting reaction and a pressor response in the patient. The magnitude and time course of this response are described for a large number of hypertensive subjects in whom the assessments were performed during ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. In nearly all of the subjects, the physician's visit was accompanied by blood pressure and heart rate increases that peaked within 4 minutes and then declined. The response was characterized by a relatively high average value; a large between-subject variability; no relation with patient age, baseline hemodynamic values, and responses to laboratory stressors; and no attenuation with multiple repetition of the physician's visit. On the other hand, the increase in blood pressure was considerably less when blood pressure assessment was made by a nurse than when it was made by a physician; in both instances, a 10-minute wait was associated with marked reduction of the initial response. Thus, the stress inherent in usual blood pressure-measuring procedures is responsible for considerable overestimations of patients' blood pressures. There are means by which this can be minimized, although a residual error is likely to remain in most subjects. Whether the stress-devoid blood pressure is a better prognostic index than the stress-related one remains unknown. 
2	Disseminated, nonmeningeal gastrointestinal cryptococcal infection in an HIV-negative patient. Gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is extremely rare, especially in patients with no involvement of the central nervous system. We describe a 63-yr-old man undergoing prednisone therapy for chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis who presented with peritonitis, colitis, and skin lesions. Pathological studies revealed necrosis and numerous cryptococcal organisms in the colon, omentum, and skin, and cultures yielded Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient died of multisystem organ failure following emergency exploratory surgery performed when he had onset of symptoms of a bowel perforation after an endoscopic biopsy. Clinicians should be aware that gastrointestinal cryptococcosis can occur in the absence of infection of the central nervous system or lungs, and that it may affect relatively healthy patients who are immunocompromised because of splenectomy, chronic liver disease, or steroid therapy. 
1	Community lifestyle characteristics and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. High rates of leukaemia in children and young people have been associated with features of community isolation and population growth. Incidence data collected by two specialist registries were used to compare incidence rates at ward level with relevant ward characteristics derived from routine census and Ordnance Survey data for England and Wales. An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was found for wards which are farthest from large urban centres. The excess was greatest for wards of higher socioeconomic status and for children aged 1-7 years (the childhood peak), for which a two-fold excess was seen. These findings in general support the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia has an infectious aetiology. 
1	A phase II trial of carboplatin and vinblastine in the treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Cisplatin-containing regimens are active in the treatment of esophageal cancer, with response rates of 25% to 35% in advanced disease. Carboplatin is less toxic than cisplatin; as a single agent, several responses were seen against esophageal tumors. To better define the role of carboplatin in esophageal cancer, the authors treated 19 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus with carboplatin and vinblastine. Carboplatin (450 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on days 1, 29, 57, and every 6 weeks thereafter) was given with vinblastine (5 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and then every 2 weeks). No major responses were seen. No significant renal toxicity and only mild gastrointestinal toxicity (emesis, diarrhea) were observed. Hematologic toxicity was more severe in patients with prior radiation therapy (RT), with three of six patients with prior RT exhibiting Grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Although generally less toxic than cisplatin-containing regimens, carboplatin and vinblastine is also less active in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Hematologic toxicity with this regimen was severe in patients who had received prior RT. 
2	Antenatal spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Spontaneous perforation of the biliary system is an unusual neonatal phenomenon that is rarely recognized at birth. To date, it has not been reported antenatally. A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus. After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites. 
4	Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm by exclusion and bypass: an analysis of outcome. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is conventionally treated by aneurysmorrhaphy with inlying graft. Alternatively, division of the aorta, with suture closure of the distal aorta and outflow vessels (exclusion of the aneurysm), and end-to-end proximal to distal bypass may be performed. However, the long-term fate of this operation has not been determined. Specifically, concern exists that the excluded blood filled aneurysm may not thrombose or may be the source of late sepsis. During an 8-year period we have treated 280 abdominal aortic aneurysms (urgent and elective) by exclusion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac and bypass via the posterolateral retroperitoneal approach. Mean age was 70 years (range, 44 to 88), with 217 men and 63 women. Preoperative CT scanning and aortography were performed to assess arterial anatomy. Seventy tube grafts and 260 bifurcation grafts were used. Thirty-day mortality rate was 4%. Estimated blood loss was 731 +/- 52 ml; mean transfusion requirements were 456 +/- 82 ml. The minor complication rate was 6%, and it is of great interest that there were no cases of ischemic colitis requiring colectomy. Aneurysm sacs thrombosed except in two anticoagulated patients who required further treatment. No late infections occurred. Five-year bypass patency rate was 98%. These data demonstrate that this method of treatment effectively minimized operative dissection and blood loss and therefore is a viable alternative for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
1	Endoscopic ultrasonography in staging rectal cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was used to stage rectal cancer by assessing depth of invasion through bowel wall layers and/or involvement of lymph nodes. EUS findings were correlated with histopathologic findings to discern the usefulness of this modality in predicting which patients could be candidates for sphinctersaving procedures and the avoidance of abdominoperineal resection. The Olympus EU-M3 endoscopic ultrasound system was used to assess depth of penetration through rectal wall layers and to identify lymph nodes. Comparison of EUS findings to histopathologic findings was possible in 13 patients. EUS agreed with histopathology in 9 of 13 cases (69.3%) ( p = 0.07, kappa statistic). EUS agreed with histopathology as the presence or absence of lymph nodes in 9 of 13 cases (69.3%) (p = 0.07). However, the presence of lymph nodes could not necessarily predict metastatic involvement of these nodes. In one patient, invasion of vaginal cuff was correctly predicted. In nine cases, computed tomographic analysis (CT) was available for comparison to EUS in detection of penetration beyond the bowel wall. CT agreed with histopathology in 3 of 9 (33%), whereas EUS agreed with histopathology in 7 of 9 (78%). 
5	Organic dust toxic syndrome: an acute febrile reaction to organic dust exposure distinct from hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Organic dust toxic syndrome is a term recently coined to describe a noninfectious, febrile illness associated with chills, malaise, myalgia, a dry cough, dyspnea, headache and nausea which occurs after heavy organic dust exposure. Organic dust toxic syndrome shares many clinical features with acute farmer's lung and other forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, including the presence of increased numbers of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage. However, organic dust toxic syndrome differs from acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis in several respects: the chest X-ray does not show infiltrates, severe hypoxemia does not occur, prior sensitization to antigens in the organic dust is not required and there are no known sequelae of physiological significance, such as the recurrent attacks and the pulmonary fibrosis which may be seen with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Organic dust toxic syndrome is thought to be much more common than farmer's lung. It is important for clinical and investigational purposes that organic dust toxic syndrome be distinguished from acute farmer's lung. 
5	The use of L-dopa and carbidopa in metastatic malignant melanoma. A combination of L-dopa and carbidopa was given orally to 17 patients with metastatic melanoma. Maximum tolerated oral doses were given, up to 4 grams daily. No response was seen in 15 patients evaluable for response. Toxicity was considerable, with seven of 17 patients (41%) stopping treatment because of unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity or postural hypotension. Contrary to previous anecdotal reports, there was no evidence that L-dopa/carbidopa treatment resulted in accelerated progression of metastatic melanoma. Orally administered L-dopa/carbidopa is ineffective as therapy for advanced melanoma when maximum tolerated doses are used. 
2	Colonoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of ileocecal tuberculosis. Two cases of ileocecal tuberculosis are presented. The diagnosis was achieved by endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), while endoscopic biopsies and brush cytology were negative. The usefulness of endoscopic FNAC in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract tuberculosis is highlighted. 
1	Glossopharyngeal schwannoma: review of five cases and the literature. Glossopharyngeal schwannomas are rare tumors in spite of the fact that acoustic schwannomas account for 8%-10% of intracranial tumors. There have been 23 reported cases in the literature. This report of five cases is the largest series of these tumors. The presentation, radiological workup, operation, and long-term postoperative results will be presented, along with a review of the literature. 
2	Anatomy of anal sphincters and related structures in continent women studied with magnetic resonance imaging. Five anally continent nulliparas of reproductive age were studied with magnetic resonance imaging. The internal and external anal sphincters could be easily delineated, as could the intervening longitudinal musculature, puborectalis muscle, anococcygeal raphe, anorectal lumen, vagina, uterus, bladder, urethra, coccyx, and pubis. The shape of the sphincters was nearly cylindrical, with an anterior component averaging 18.3 mm thick and 28.0 mm long. Fifty-four percent of this anterior thickness was attributable to the internal sphincter. The anorectal angle varied considerably, with a mean of 86.8 +/- 19.1 degrees (range 60-112). The angle between the portion of the rectal lumen supported by the anococcygeal raphe, or levator plate, and the plane of the puborectalis muscle was consistent at 149.0 +/- 6.3 degrees (138-154). The finding of anterior anal sphincters with substantial thickness and length contrasts markedly with a view often pictured in the literature of a female anal sphincter that narrows anteriorly to half its posterior length and forms a small bundle of muscle rather than a broad band. Knowledge of these relationships is important in primary repair of obstetric sphincter lacerations as well as in surgical correction of anal incontinence. 
4	Raynaud's syndrome. Using a range of therapies to help patients. Raynaud's syndrome is a common medical problem. Approach to diagnosis must involve a search for underlying causes. Treatment includes avoidance of precipitating factors, biofeedback, and possibly pharmacologic therapy, after careful consideration of risks. 
1	Detection, prevalence, and prognosis of asymptomatic carcinoma of the cervix. Between 1979-1986, 82 of 407 patients (20%) treated for infiltrative carcinoma of the cervix were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen (20%) of these 82 patients had stage IA, 60 (73%) had stage IB, and six (7%) had stage IIA disease. Asymptomatic patients represented 16 of 23 (70%) of stage IA, 60 of 196 (31%) of stage IB, and six of 77 (8%) of stage IIA. In the Netherlands, population screening for cervical carcinoma is conducted on women aged 35-55 years. To examine the prevalence of asymptomatic cervical carcinoma and the way in which it was detected in different age groups, we studied the patients referred to our department. Among the patients younger than 35 years with cervical carcinoma, 20 of 70 (29%) were asymptomatic with disease detected by incidental screening, whereas eight of 177 (5%) in the group 55 years or older had been detected by incidental screening. In the age category 35-55 years, 54 of 160 (34%) were asymptomatic. Patients aged 35-55 years had undergone population screening or incidental screening. In the patients 55 years or older, asymptomatic disease was significantly less prevalent than in younger patients. Only one of the 66 asymptomatic patients in stage IB or higher suffered tumor recurrence. Among symptomatic patients, 25 of 136 (18%) with stage IB and 17 of 71 (24%) with stage IIA had tumor recurrence. Despite the favorable prognosis of patients with asymptomatic carcinoma, asymptomatic presentation could not be shown to be a significant prognostic factor, as were tumor diameter and lymph node status. 
5	Infantile systemic hyalinosis: newly recognized disorder of collagen? Four infants with stiff skin and painful joint contractures in the first few months of life are described. Other features included small papules, particularly on the face and trunk, perianal nodules, hyperpigmentation over the metacarpophalangeal joints and over the malleoli, gingival hyperplasia, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Two of these infants died before the age of 18 months. In each case hyaline material was found in the papillary dermis. Ultrastructurally, there was a distinctive fibrillogranular appearance in which a banding pattern could be observed. This material was also found within membrane-bound vacuoles in macrophages and fibroblasts. It had an appearance and localization identical with that of collagen type VI. These features are similar to those reported in juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. It is believed that these infants have a closely related, but nonetheless distinctive, inherited disorder of collagen. 
5	Erythema infectiosum and pregnancy-related complications Erythema infectiosum, an acute, communicable viral disease with a highly distinctive exanthem, follows the usual course of a self-limiting benign disease. In pregnant women, however, it may be associated with fetal death and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Because of the association of human parvovirus (HPV) B19 infection with fetal damage we reviewed the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of erythema infectiosum, focusing on pregnancy and fetal outcome, to determine the magnitude of fetal risk and offer recommendations for management. Among 180 infected pregnant women 44 fetal deaths (24%) occurred, 1 to 12 weeks after the infection was noted. Pregnant women should be advised that (a) because of the high prevalence (up to 65%) of anti-HPV B19 IgG antibody among adults most of them are not at risk and (b) if maternal infection does occur therapeutic abortion is not indicated since intrauterine infection causes fetal death more often than abnormal development. Infection should be suspected in pregnant women who exhibit the symptoms of erythema infectiosum with or without arthropathy. They should be monitored for an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (indicating fetal aplastic crisis) and undergo serial ultrasonography for the detection of hydrops fetalis. Although the incidence of congenital malformation is no higher than the expected rate in the general population (3% to 5%), the precise incidence of fetal adverse outcomes remains unknown and requires investigation in larger, prospective studies. 
4	Hemodynamic influence of LVAD on right ventricular failure. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping has hemodynamic and anatomic influences on right ventricular performance. A total artificial heart (TAH) model was employed to better understand the hemodynamic influence of an LVAD on the failing right ventricle. Biventricular failure was simulated by reducing both ventricular drive pressures of the TAH. After getting hemodynamic data, LVAD pumping in the case of right ventricular failure was simulated by increasing just the left ventricular drive pressure. In the LVAD-simulating condition, cardiac output increased and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the biventricular failure condition, whereas right ventricular function and minute work were the same in these two conditions. Even though changes were accompanied by adaptive increases in pulmonary resistance, substantially lower pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures resulted in the LVAD-simulating condition. From a hemodynamic perspective, these results indicate that an LVAD can increase right ventricular volume work by decreasing right ventricular pressure work, whereas right ventricular net pressure-volume work is unchanged and right ventricular failure is not worsened. 
2	Enhanced expression of CD2 antigen on lung T cells. CD2 molecules not only function in the adhesion of T cells to other cell types but also in the activation of T cells via an alternative pathway. To investigate the possible roles of CD2 molecules in the activation and accumulation of lung T cells, using monoclonal antibodies and a flow cytometer we evaluated CD2 antigen expression on lung and blood lymphocytes in 10 normal subjects, 30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 7 patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease, 5 patients with farmer's lung disease, and 8 patients with Crohn's disease. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD2 on lung T cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher than that on blood T cells in all study groups except the control group. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis this enhancement of the expression of CD2 antigen was observed only on CD4+ T cells. Since ligands for CD2 are present on immunocompetent cells of other types in the local pulmonary milieu, these results suggest that increased expression of CD2 molecules could facilitate the communication and interaction of lung T cells with their environment in the lung and thereby possibly contribute to the local accumulation of T cells. 
5	Six year follow up of a consecutive series of patients presenting to the coronary care unit with acute chest pain: prognostic importance of the electrocardiogram In a retrospective 6 year follow up data were obtained for 536 of 566 (95%) consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with acute chest pain. Their diagnoses were acute myocardial infarction in 290 (54%), myocardial ischaemia in 164 (31%), pericarditis in 16 (3%), and non-cardiac in 66 (12%). Six year mortality was 36%, 24%, 0%, and 16% respectively. In patients with acute myocardial infarction a higher mortality rate during follow up was associated with a higher than average age, a higher than average creatine kinase, previous myocardial infarction, Q wave infarction, and the presence of reciprocal changes. The presence of reciprocal changes was associated with higher than average concentration of serum creatine kinase, indicating more extensive infarction. Infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation or left bundle branch block was associated with a higher death rate. The electrocardiogram recorded at the time of acute myocardial infarction contains much useful prognostic information. 
4	Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. 
5	Correlation of the structure of the transmembrane domain of the neu oncogene-encoded p185 protein with its function. The human homologue of the neu oncogene is frequently found in human tumors. Certain amino acid substitutions at position 664 in the transmembrane domain of the neu oncogene-encoded p185 protein product are known to cause malignant transformation of cells. Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (empirical conformational energies for polypeptides program), we have previously determined the preferred three-dimensional structures for the transmembrane domain of the p185 protein with a transforming (glutamic acid) and a nontransforming (valine) substitution at the critical position 664 and found that the global minimum-energy conformation of this region in the nontransforming protein contains a sharp bend, whereas the global minimum-energy conformation for this region from the transforming protein is entirely alpha-helical. We now demonstrate that this result holds for other known nontransforming (glycine, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine) and transforming (glutamine) substitutions at position 664. Furthermore, a simple statistical thermodynamic analysis of the results indicates that approximately 85% of each of the nontransforming sequences exist with the bend at positions 664 and 665, while approximately 90% of each of the transforming sequences exist as an alpha-helix. About 9% of the nontransforming sequences exist as the alpha-helix. These results suggest that if the intracellular concentration of the normal protein is increased at least 10-fold, thereby increasing the alpha-helical form by this factor, cell transformation should result. This conclusion is directly supported by genetic experiments in which this level of overexpression of the normal protein was achieved with attendant cell transformation. 
2	Amelioration of cholinergic-induced pancreatitis with a selective cholecystokinin receptor antagonist. Acute edematous pancreatitis follows excessive cholinergic stimulation in patients exposed to anticholinesterase-containing insecticides. We describe the role of cholecystokinin and the benefits of cholecystokinin receptor blockade in this form of pancreatitis. A cholinergic mimetic (carbachol) was administered to rats weighing 300 to 350 g and produced a form of edematous pancreatitis that mimics that seen in humans. Animals received carbachol intraperitoneally, either alone (250 micrograms/kg of body weight) or with cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist devazepide (3 mg/kg of body weight) and were killed 4 hours later. Carbachol administration resulted in a 19% increase in pancreatic weight, a fourfold increase in serum amylase levels, and a 14-fold increase in serum lipase levels. Plasma cholecystokinin levels, however, were not altered. Devazepide administered prior to cholinergic hyperstimulation blocked pancreatic weight increase and reduced elevations in serum amylase levels twofold and lipase levels fourfold. Although cholecystokinin levels are not elevated in this model of pancreatitis, blockade of even low, background concentrations of this regulatory peptide is beneficial. 
4	Practicalities of lipids: ICU patient, autoimmune disease, and vascular disease. Although the use of lipids should be individualized, certain generalizations are appropriate. 1. Lipid infusion should be limited in the fulminately septic patient to 10% of total calories in an effort to reduce immunosuppression. 2. The stressed, nonseptic patient with difficulties in ventilator weaning or TPN-induced hepatic dysfunction may reap benefit from a reduction in dextrose calories and the provision of daily lipids. 3. Patients with severe autoimmune disease have had mild amelioration of symptoms with PUFA supplementation. The relative benefits of omega-6 vs omega-3 continue to be examined. 4. Dietary immunomodulation in transplant and burns remains an area of active investigation. 5. Patients with fat-free TPN show transient declines in serum lipids. The development of a "fat-solubilizer" remains in the experimental realm. 6. The provision of fish oil, high in W-3 EPA, has shown promise in atherosclerosis and immunomodulation. The changes in the relative amounts of each prostaglandin class depend on precursor prevalence. 
1	Surgical management of carcinoid heart disease Metastatic carcinoid tumor is often seen with flushing, diarrhea, and cardiac symptoms--the carcinoid syndrome. Cardiac failure is often associated with major morbidity and mortality in carcinoid disease. In this report, a case of successful cardiac valvar surgical intervention has resulted in prolonged alleviation of cardiac symptoms and survival. 
4	Contractility and stiffness of noninfarcted myocardium after coronary ligation in rats. Effects of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that global left ventricular function is depressed after myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the effects of myocardial infarction on contractility and the passive-elastic properties of residual myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated isometric function and passive myocardial stiffness in isolated, noninfarcted left ventricular papillary muscle from rats 6 weeks after sham operation or myocardial infarction. Maximal developed tension and peak rate of tension rise (+dT/dt) were significantly decreased in untreated rats with large myocardial infarction compared with controls (3.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.3 +/- 0.6 g/mm2 and 49.5 +/- 17.5 versus 72.5 +/- 10.5 g/mm2/sec, respectively). Time to peak tension was prolonged (120 +/- 8 versus 102 +/- 4 msec) and myocardial stiffness was increased in untreated myocardial infarction rats compared with controls (35.2 +/- 4.9 versus 24.2 +/- 3.7). Rats with smaller myocardial infarctions differed from controls only with respect to a prolongation of time to peak tension. Papillary muscle myocyte cross-sectional area was increased by 44% (p less than 0.05), and myocardial hydroxyproline content was increased by 160% (p less than 0.05) in rats with large myocardial infarctions compared with controls. To determine whether treatment that improves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction also improves myocardial function, rats were treated with captopril beginning 3 weeks after myocardial infarction and continuing for 3 weeks. Treatment with captopril attenuated the prolongation in time to peak tension in the myocardial infarction rats; however, developed tension, +dT/dt, and muscle stiffness remained abnormal. Compared with untreated myocardial infarction rats, captopril-treated myocardial infarction rats had a 9% decrease in myocyte cross-sectional area (p = 0.1) but a persistent increase in myocardial collagen content. In summary, large myocardial infarction in rats causes contractile dysfunction, increased stiffness, myocyte hypertrophy, and increased collagen content in the residual noninfarcted myocardium. Treatment with captopril alters the process of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy and improves one parameter of contractility in noninfarcted myocardium; however, myocardial collagen content and myocardial stiffness remain abnormal. CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the rat infarct model of heart failure improves global cardiac performance via combined effects on myocardial function and the peripheral circulation. 
4	Left ventricular ejection fraction may not be useful as an end point of thrombolytic therapy comparative trials. In the era of comparative and adjunctive trials in reperfusion therapy, the need to develop alternative end points for mortality reduction is clear. Left ventricular ejection fraction, which has been commonly used as a surrogate, is problematic due to missing values, technically inadequate studies, and lack of correlation with mortality results in controlled reperfusion trials performed to date. In this paper, we present a composite clinical end point that includes, in order, severity of adverse outcome death, hemorrhagic stroke, nonhemorrhagic stroke, poor ejection fraction (less than 30%), reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Such a composite index may be useful to detect true therapeutic benefit in reperfusion trials without necessitating greater than 20-30,000 patient enrollment. 
4	Intravenous enalaprilat therapy for hypertension. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is available for intravenous administration in the form of enalaprilat. Intravenous enalaprilat is indicated for the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. However, there are no reports of intravenous enalaprilat therapy exceeding one week in duration. We report the case of a critically ill, 39-year-old woman who received intravenous enalaprilat for the management of hypertension for a period of 21 days. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were controlled adequately on a regimen of enalaprilat 1.25 mg iv piggyback q6h without any apparent adverse effects. 
1	Treatment of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma with bleomycin as a single agent. A nonrandomized trial was conducted to assess the efficiency and toxicity of bleomycin as a single agent in treatment of non-life-threatening AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Sixty patients were enrolled in this study. They all had a disseminated and progressive non-life-threatening AIDS-related KS associated with systemic symptoms and/or CD4 lymphocyte count less than 400/mm3. Thirty patients were treated with intramuscular bleomycin (5 mg/d for 3 days every 2 or 3 weeks) and 30 others with a slow continuous intravenous infusion of bleomycin (6 mg/m3/d for 4 days every 4 weeks). The mean duration of therapy was 5 months (range, 2 to 24 months). A partial response was observed in 29 patients (48.3%) and the disease was stabilized in 18 additional patients (30%). Bleomycin failed in 21.6% of patients. Therapy had to be discontinued in two patients because of side effects. Thus bleomycin as a single agent is a good alternative therapy for AIDS-related KS. 
5	The hypotympanum and infralabyrinthine cells in chronic otitis media. Despite the localization implied by the term "chronic otitis media," little attention has been paid to the role of the hypotympanum in chronic active otitis media. Most authors have emphasized the role of recurrent cholesteatoma or unexenterated cells in the mastoid cell system as causes of recurrent disease. Seven cases are reported in which clinical evidence indicated that recurrent chronic otitis media was limited to the hypotympanum and infralabyrinthine cell system. In the five cases in which revision surgery was done, exenteration of this area resulted in an asymptomatic ear. The anatomy, radiographic evaluation, and surgical approach to the hypotympanum are reviewed. Careful inspection of the hypotympanum in primary surgery for chronic ear disease and exenteration of the hypotympanic and proximal infralabyrinthine cell tract are advocated when these regions contain cholesteatoma or extensive granulomatous disease. 
3	Role of perfusion pressure and flow in major organ dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass. The role of perfusion pressure and flow during cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and hemodilution in the development of new postoperative renal or clinically apparent cerebral dysfunction was examined in 504 adults. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow was targeted at greater than 40 mL.kg-1.min-1 and pressure at greater than 50 mm Hg. Flows and pressures less than target occurred in 21.6% and 97.1% of patients, respectively. Fifteen patients (3.0%) suffered new renal and 13 (2.6%) new central nervous system dysfunction. Low pressure or flow during cardiopulmonary bypass, expressed in absolute values or in intensity-duration units, were not predictors of either adverse outcome. Multivariate analysis identified use of postoperative intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (p less than 10(-6], excessive blood loss in the ICU (p less than 10(-4], need for vasopressors before cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 10(-4], postoperative myocardial infarction (p less than 10(-3], emergency reoperation (p less than 0.002), excessive postoperative transfusion (p less than 0.02), and chronic renal disease (p less than 0.03) as independent predictors of postoperative renal dysfunction. Independent predictors of postoperative central nervous system dysfunction were cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the intensive care unit (p less than 10(-6], intracardiac thrombus or valve calcification (p less than 0.02), and chronic renal disease (p less than 0.03). Age greater than 65 years (40.7% of patients) did not predict either outcome. We conclude that failure of the native circulation during periods other than cardiopulmonary bypass rather than the flows and pressures considered here is the major cause of renal and clinically apparent central nervous system dysfunction after cardiac operations. 
1	The role of etoposide in the treatment of poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PDA) of unknown primary site comprise 25% to 35% of the patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site. Some of these patients have neoplasms that are highly responsive to combination chemotherapy, and a minority have potentially curable tumors. Between 1978 and 1982, 68 patients were treated with combination chemotherapy (most received cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin [PVB] with or without doxorubicin). Thirty-eight patients (56%) responded to treatment, with 15 (22%) complete responder (CR) and 9 (13%) long-term, disease-free survivors. Since that time, we have incorporated etoposide into the treatment of these patients because of its synergism with cisplatin and its great activity against several other neoplasms, including germ cell tumors. Seventeen patients with PDC of unknown primary site received salvage therapy with etoposide and cisplatin after failing PVB. Ten of these patients had partial responses (PR), with a median response duration of 5 months (range, 2 to 12 months). Thirty-two previously untreated patients with PDC received etoposide and cisplatin combinations as initial treatment. Eighteen of 30 evaluable patients (60%) responded to therapy, and 11 patients (37%) had CR. Seven patients remain disease-free 39 to 63 months after the completion of therapy. Etoposide is an active drug in the treatment of PDC of unknown primary site. Preliminary results indicate that initial treatment with etoposide and cisplatin combinations produces results equivalent to or superior to those achieved with PVB. 
4	Differential histopathology of primary atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions in coronary arteries and saphenous vein bypass grafts: analysis of tissue obtained from 73 patients by directional atherectomy. Vascular tissue obtained using a directional percutaneous atherectomy device was examined microscopically. Tissue was obtained from coronary arteries without prior instrumentation (primary lesions, n = 31), aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts with primary lesions (n = 8), coronary arteries with lesions developing after prior balloon angioplasty or mechanical atherectomy (restenotic lesions, n = 30) and vein bypass grafts with restenotic lesions (n = 4). Primary lesions were characterized by dense intimal fibrosis with necrotic debris (83% of intimal tissue) and foam cells typical of atherosclerosis. These lesions frequently contained cholesterol crystals (45% of coronary arteries, 50% of vein grafts) and calcium deposits (65% of coronary arteries, 38% of vein grafts). Restenotic lesions were characterized by an increased proportion of loose fibroproliferative tissue (45% of coronary artery intima, 35% of vein graft intima). Immunohistochemical stains confirmed this proliferative tissue to be primarily smooth muscle cells. Thrombus was rarely observed. Comparison of resected tissues indicated that dense fibrosis and necrosis are significantly more common in primary than in restenotic lesions (83% versus 56% of intimal tissue, p = 0.0005), whereas smooth muscle cell hyperplasia is more common in restenotic than in primary lesions (44% versus 17% of intimal tissue, p less than 0.0005). Partial-thickness resection of medial tissue or full-thickness resection of media with associated adventitial tissue occurred in 27 (56%) of 39 primary atheromatous lesions and 16 (47%) of 34 restenotic lesions; subintimal tissue obtained from primary lesions appeared identical to that obtained from restenotic lesions. These data indicate that the histopathologic characteristics of the neointimal layer of restenotic lesions differ from those of the intimal layer of primary atherosclerotic lesions. 
1	Survival and quality of life among patients receiving unproven as compared with conventional cancer therapy. BACKGROUND. Cancer treatments without proved efficacy have achieved new levels of popularity, particularly among well-educated patients. The value of these therapies is vigorously debated. METHODS. We compared the length of survival and quality of life in patients who received treatment at a prominent unorthodox cancer clinic in addition to conventional treatment and in matched control patients from an academic cancer center who received only conventional treatment. All the patients had documented extensive malignant disease associated with a predicted median survival time of less than one year. The study sample consisted of 78 pairs of patients matched according to sex, race, age, diagnosis, and time from the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent disease, who were enrolled over a period of 3 1/2 years. Periodic follow-up (approximately every two months) continued until death. RESULTS. There was no difference between the two patient groups in length of survival. Median survival for both groups was 15 months (P = 0.22; relative risk, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.72). Quality-of-life scores were consistently better among conventionally treated patients from enrollment on. CONCLUSIONS. For this sample of patients with extensive disease and for this particular unorthodox treatment regimen, conventional and unorthodox treatments produced similar results. 
5	Limitations of electroencephalographic monitoring in the detection of cerebral ischemia accompanying carotid endarterectomy. An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy. 
4	Relation of serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels to presence and severity of angiographic coronary artery disease. To assess the relation of lipid levels to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), lipid profiles were obtained on 125 men and 72 women undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. CAD, defined as greater than or equal to 25% diameter narrowing in a major coronary artery, was present in 106 men (85%) and 54 women (75%). Multiple regression analyses revealed that only high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in men, and age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio in women, were independently associated with the presence of CAD after adjustment for other risk factors. HDL cholesterol level and age were significantly correlated with both extent (number of diseased vessels) and severity (percent maximum stenosis) of CAD in men. In women, age was the only independent variable related to severity, whereas age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were related to extent. Of 71 patients with total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl, 79% had CAD. With multiple regression analyses, HDL cholesterol was the only variable independently related to the presence and severity of CAD in these patients after adjustment for age and gender; extent was significantly associated with age and male gender, and was unrelated to any of the lipid parameters. With use of multiple logistic and linear regression analyses of the group of 197 patients, HDL cholesterol was the most powerful independent variable associated with the presence and severity of CAD after adjustment for age and gender. HDL cholesterol was also an independent predictor of extent. Age was independently associated with each of the end points examined, and was the variable most significantly related to extent. These data add to the growing body of information demonstrating an important association between HDL and CAD. 
1	Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined. Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio. To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess. Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels. Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations. 
4	Calcium channel blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: renal effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are two classes of antihypertensive agents with novel effects on renal function. In both experimental and clinical studies, calcium channel blockers tend to increase renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion in essential hypertension. ACE inhibitors have similar effects on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in essential hypertension, but they tend to cause sodium retention. ACE inhibitors can cause marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate in renovascular hypertension, making them a problematic choice for the treatment of this form of hypertension. In chronic, progressive renal diseases, ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease protein excretion and morphologic evidence of glomerulosclerosis. The relationship of the decrease in protein excretion to the progression of renal disease has not yet been established. 
1	Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in patients with pheochromocytoma. Platelet and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined in 17 patients with surgically proven pheochromocytoma (mean age 42.3 years); in 31 patients with borderline hypertension (mean age 35.3 years) and in 9 healthy controls (mean age 39.3 years). Both platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly increased in patients with pheochromocytoma when compared with hypertensive and control groups (P less than .001). No correlation between platelet and plasma catecholamines was detected in all studied groups. The diagnostic accuracy of platelet catecholamine in pheochromocytoma is limited since increased platelet norepinephrine was found in 35.5% and increased platelet epinephrine was found in 19.4% of patients with essential hypertension. 
3	Quantitation of skin vasomotor control in normal subjects and in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. Peripheral autonomic neuropathy in diabetes has been difficult to evaluate. We have developed a test to quantitate sympathetic skin vasomotor function in the extremities. Skin vasomotor reflexes were investigated after warming and cooling the left arm and recording changes in skin temperature as a measure of skin blood flow in the right hand and both feet. Twenty-three diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and 28 healthy control subjects were examined. In contrast to the healthy subjects, the diabetic patients showed reduced or even absent responses in skin temperature to both warming and cooling. The rate of skin temperature decrease for the hand and feet during cooling, which was used as the actual parameter to quantitate skin vasomotor control, was significantly reduced in the diabetic group as compared with the healthy control subjects. We conclude that this technique provides a simple non-invasive method for quantitating skin vasomotor function in the extremities of diabetic patients. 
4	Magnitude and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism during oral amiodarone therapy. To examine the presence and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism produced by amiodarone, the heart rate, QT interval and arrhythmia frequency in response to graded doses of isoproterenol were evaluated in eight patients treated with oral amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Measurements were made before and every 2 days after beginning oral amiodarone therapy (600 mg twice daily). Isoproterenol was given in doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min. The mean heart rate at rest decreased from 73.1 +/- 17.8 beats/min on day 0 to 57.8 +/- 15.0 beats/min after 12 days of amiodarone therapy. A significant linear decline in heart rate at rest was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). On all days isoproterenol produced a progressive increase in heart rate that reached 115.5 +/- 20.2 beats/min on day 0 and 94.2 +/- 18.5 beats/min on day 12. Amiodarone blunted the heart rate increase produced by isoproterenol on days 2 to 12 (p less than 0.05 versus day 0). This effect was present by day 2 and did not change significantly thereafter. The mean corrected QT (QTc) interval increased from 430 +/- 30 ms on day 0 to 449 +/- 63 ms on day 12. A significant linear increase in QTc interval was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). There was no systematic effect of isoproterenol on the QTc interval. Five of eight patients had a significant number of isoproterenol-induced premature ventricular complexes. Ventricular ectopic activity in response to isoproterenol was abolished after 4 days of amiodarone therapy. 
4	Treatment of postoperative infection of ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch, including use of viable omentum and muscle flaps. Postoperative infection of the ascending aorta and aortic arch in 40 patients was treated by antibiotic therapy alone (4 patients) or by operation and lifelong suppressive antibiotic therapy (36 patients). Complications of infection included antibiotic-resistant infection, infected false aneurysm, rupture of suture line, aortocutaneous fistulas, aortic-right ventricular fistulas, arterial embolus, aortic valve insufficiency, aortobronchial fistula, mediastinal abscess, and chest wall problems. These were treated by a variety of operations including composite valve-graft replacement, graft replacement, patch-graft closure of false aneurysm, simple suture of disrupted suture lines and false aneurysm, and debridement of mediastinum and chest wall. The area of reconstruction was covered, and mediastinal dead space was reduced by mobilization of viable tissue, including local tissue and distant structures such as flaps of muscle and omentum. Thirty-three patients (83%) were early survivors, and 28 patients (70%) were alive and well at last follow-up 4 months to 6.5 years after operation. 
1	Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content in partial hydatidiform moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Hydatidiform moles may be classified as partial or complete based on genetic and pathologic criteria. Between January 1979 and January 1990, 17 (5.5%) of 310 patients followed for partial mole developed persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Tissues from 14 partial moles were available for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. Eleven partial moles (85%) were triploid, two (15%) were diploid, and one DNA histogram was uninterpretable. All patients with triploid partial moles achieved complete remission with one course of single-agent chemotherapy. The two with diploid partial mole required multiple courses of chemotherapy to achieve gonadotropin remission. Although the DNA content of most partial moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor was triploid, diploid partial moles with persistent tumor were less sensitive to single-agent chemotherapy. 
1	Diet and female sex hormone concentrations: an intervention study for the type of fat consumed. A possible mechanism by which dietary fat may influence the development of breast cancer is by influencing the concentration of female sex hormones. This study investigated the effect of alteration in the type of fat consumed on concentrations of female sex hormones in serum. Female volunteers were randomly assigned to continue on their usual meat-eating diet, change to a vegetarian diet, or change to a diet that was predominantly vegetarian but where fish was consumed at least three times per week. Change to the vegetarian or fish diet had little effect on diet total hormone concentrations; however, the amount of estradiol was significantly decreased in the vegetarian group. When nutrient consumption was correlated with hormone concentrations, prolactin was directly associate with fat consumption, sex-hormone-binding globulin was inversely associated with fat consumption (particularly cholesterol consumption), and the proportion of nonprotein-bound estradiol was directly associated with complex carbohydrate consumption. 
2	Hepatic amino-nitrogen clearance to urea-nitrogen in control subjects and in patients with cirrhosis: a simplified method. The functional hepatic nitrogen clearance during amino acid infusion is a measure of liver cell mass. The clinical feasibility of the test has so far been limited by methodological problems. A simplified procedure was used to measure the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate and functional hepatic nitrogen clearance in nine subjects with normal liver function and in nine patients with cirrhosis. The method was based on only four consecutive 2-hr urine collections and five blood samples. Total body water was calculated from a nomogram based on age and anthropometric data, whereas the gut urea hydrolysis was assigned one fixed fraction of synthesis (0.17 in control subjects and 0.26 in patients with cirrhosis). Finally, a solution of a single amino acid, alanine, was infused as substrate for urea synthesis. Urea-nitrogen synthesis rate increased linearly with increasing alpha-amino-nitrogen concentration, and the slope of the regression (functional hepatic nitrogen clearance) was reduced in cirrhosis from 37.5 +/- 7.0 L/hr to 18.4 +/- 6.7 L/hr; p less than 0.005. The hepatic nitrogen clearance was linearly related to the clinical status (Child-Pugh score), to routine liver function tests and to galactose elimination capacity (r = 0.869), a well-established, quantitative, liver function measure. The simplified method makes the measurement of hepatic nitrogen clearance suitable for routine clinical use. The test might prove useful to study the alterations of nitrogen metabolism in cirrhosis, with special reference to hepatic encephalopathy. 
5	Sexual changes in hemiparetic patients. Eighty-six patients, each with hemiparesis caused by a single stroke, were studied to assess the changes in sexual life experienced after the onset of the illness. Clinical data were collected, and a questionnaire concerning both sexual behavior and feelings about sexuality was administered to the patients and their spouses. Twenty-four couples were eliminated from further analysis because of a discrepancy between husband and wife in the answers concerning sexual behavior after stroke. A marked decline in sexual activity after stroke was found in both genders; other aspects of sexual behavior underwent fewer changes. The feeling of an overall change in sexual life was reported more frequently by male patients. Most patients' spouses reported the feeling of an overall psychological change in their partners and the feeling of an overall change in sexual life after the onset of the illness. No significant associations were found between clinical features and changes in sexual life. This study confirms that cerebrovascular accidents are generally followed by some important alterations in sexual life. Clinical factors do not seem to play a crucial role in determining these changes, which may be better explained in terms of maladjustment attributable to psychologic and interpersonal factors. 
5	Intraocular pressure and the rate of visual field loss in chronic open-angle glaucoma. We measured the rate of change of visual field threshold values over time (mean follow-up, 44.9 +/- 17.4 months) by trend analysis in 40 eyes of 40 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Twenty-eight eyes had stable visual fields, and two eyes had significant visual field improvement. Ten eyes had significant visual field deterioration and showed a correlation between indices of intraocular pressure (standard error of the mean, P = .02; standard deviation, P = .04; and range, P = .05) and the rate of visual field loss in the superonasal region of the visual field, such that the greater the variation of intraocular pressure the greater the rate of loss. The group losing visual fields had a higher mean visual field threshold value and significantly less optic disk pallor and cupping at the start of the study than the stable visual field group. Thus, a significant rate of visual field loss occurred at an earlier stage of the disease and showed a correlation with intraocular pressure in this stage. 
5	Effect of V1-vasopressin receptor blockade on arterial pressure in conscious rats with cirrhosis and ascites. Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin in human cirrhosis with ascites is associated with a significant reduction in arterial pressure, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II plays an important role in the maintenance of systemic hemodynamics in this condition. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether vasopressin also contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhosis with ascites. The study was performed using three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites and three groups of control animals. The administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective antagonist of the vascular effect of vasopressin, to 10 cirrhotic rats induced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 94 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and a significant increase in plasma renin activity (from 24.3 +/- 4.9 to 34.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL.h; P less than 0.02) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 1474 +/- 133 to 2433 +/- 253 pg/mL; P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed following saralasin administration in a second group of 5 cirrhotic rats [mean arterial pressure decreased from 97 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.0001); and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentration increased from 18.4 +/- 5.8 to 40.3 +/- 5.7 ng/mL.h (P less than 0.02) and from 1383 +/- 70 to 2312 +/- 334 pg/mL (P less than 0.05), respectively]. The simultaneous blockade of angiotensin II and vasopressin in a third group of cirrhotic rats resulted in a significantly greater reduction of mean arterial pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). No changes in arterial pressure were observed in the three groups of control rats. These findings indicate that endogenous vasopressin is as important as angiotensin II in the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhotic rats with ascites and support the contention that arterial hypotension is the initial event leading to the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin in this animal model of cirrhosis. 
4	Renal vein renins: inability to predict response to revascularization in patients with hypertension. To determine whether the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio (CSRVRR) could enable identification of patients with hemodynamically significant renovascular lesions who would respond to revascularization, the authors measured CSRVRRs in 143 consecutive patients with hypertension who had been selected because of clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension. All patients underwent conventional renal arteriography. Renovascular hypertension was the final diagnosis if revascularization resulted in cure or improvement in blood pressure. Complete data were available for 133 patients. Twenty patients had renovascular hypertension; CSRVRR was greater than 1.5 in 13 of these 20 patients (sensitivity, 65%). However, it was also greater than 1.5 in 54 of the 113 patients without renovascular hypertension (false-positive rate, 47.8%). The positive predictive value of CSRVRR was 18.6%; the negative predictive value, 89.3%. It is concluded that CSRVRR is not sufficiently sensitive to enable prediction of which patients will respond to revascularization and is not specific enough to exclude patients who do not have renovascular hypertension. 
2	Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. An unusual but favorable association? During the 26th week of a first pregnancy, a 25-year-old woman presented with pruritus suggesting an intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. The pruritus, however, persisted despite the premature delivery of a normal newborn at the 35th week. Moreover, aspartate aminotransferase activity increased, reaching a maximum of 38 times normal level on the 17th day after the delivery. Thus, an acute fatty liver of pregnancy was suspected and confirmed by liver biopsy. This patient appeared to have both intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, an association not previously reported. It is suggested that intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy caused premature delivery, which in turn may have prevented the onset of severe maternal and fetal complications caused by acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
5	A newly recognized fastidious gram-negative pathogen as a cause of fever and bacteremia BACKGROUND. We identified a motile, curved, gram-negative bacillus as the cause of persistent fever and bacteremia in two patients with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. The same organism was subsequently recovered from a bone marrow-transplant recipient with septicemia and from two immunocompetent persons with week-long febrile illnesses. All the patients recovered after antimicrobial therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Primary cultures of blood processed by centrifugation after blood-cell lysis yielded adherent, white, iridescent, morphologically heterogeneous colonies in 5 to 15 days. Subcultures grew in four days on chocolate, charcoal-yeast extract, or blood agar. The organisms stained weakly with safranin and were not acid-fast. Fluorescent-antibody tests for legionella and francisella were negative. Biochemical reactivity was minimal and difficult to ascertain. Agar-dilution testing revealed in vitro susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents tested. The cellular fatty acid composition of the isolates was similar, resembling that of Rochalimaea quintana or brucella species, but not Helicobacter pylori or species of campylobacter or legionella. As resolved by gel electrophoresis, cell-membrane preparations of all isolates contained similar proteins, with patterns that differed from that of R. quintana. Patterns of digestion of DNA from all isolates by EcoRV restriction endonuclease were virtually identical and also differed from that of R. quintana. On immunodiffusion, serum from one convalescent patient produced a line of identity with sonicates of all five isolates. CONCLUSIONS. This pathogen may have been unidentified until now because of its slow growth, broad susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, and possible requirement of blood-cell lysis for recovery in culture. It should be sought as a cause of unexplained fever, especially in persons with defective cell-mediated immunity. 
1	Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: clinico-pathological correlations. Three new cases of limbic encephalitis in association with malignancy are reported. The literature on this condition is reviewed and the clinical, laboratory and histopathological features of cases proven at necropsy are correlated. The possible pathogenic mechanism of this disorder is discussed. 
4	Hemodynamics in internal carotid artery occlusion examined by positron emission tomography. Using positron emission tomography in nine patients with minor strokes, unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion, and good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, we analyzed regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction, and cerebral blood volume. These studies allowed quantification of the regional hemodynamic status, especially in relation to watershed areas. Compared with eight normal controls, the patients had significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory and the surrounding watershed areas of the occluded hemisphere. The oxygen extraction fraction rose with the distance from the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, attaining the highest value in the superior parietal and posterior temporo-occipital watershed area. A concomitant decrease in the cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood volume ratio suggested reduction in the mean blood flow velocity, whereby elevated blood viscosity would be more liable to reduce cerebral blood flow. These findings suggest hemodynamic vulnerability of the watershed areas after internal carotid artery occlusion in persons with good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis. Our results also emphasize the importance of systemic hemodynamic factors such as blood pressure and circulating blood volume in the genesis of watershed infarction. 
1	The immunoperoxidase localization of tumour markers in ovarian cancer: the value of CEA, EMA, cytokeratin and DD9. Primary tumours from 40 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, treated at St Thomas's Hospital over a 10-year period, were studied for the immunocytochemical expression of the following tumour markers in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded material: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CAM 5.2), and DD9. An indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique was used. All of the tumours were positive for EMA and CAM 5.2, and 30% of them were positive for both CEA and DD9. The absence of CEA and DD9 may be of value in differentiating between metastatic abdominal adenocarcinomas of ovarian origin and those of gastrointestinal origin, but no indication of prognosis was obtained using these epithelial markers. The strong and widespread staining of all the tumours for EMA suggests that this may be a useful marker for detecting metastatic or recurrent disease by immunoscintigraphy. 
5	Effect of recombinant hirudin, a specific inhibitor of thrombin, on endotoxin-induced intravascular coagulation and acute lung injury in pigs. We hypothesized that thrombin activation may play a prominent role in endotoxin-induced secondary organ failure, such as acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we administered a thrombin-specific inhibitor, recombinant hirudin, in endotoxemic pigs. The pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and prepared with Swan-Ganz and extravascular lung water (EVLW) catheters. A total of 18 randomly selected animals received a pretreatment of 1,000 U/kg of hirudin, followed by a continuous infusion over 6 h of 500 U/kg/h given simultaneously with the infusion of 10 micrograms/kg/h of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin. Another 18 animals received a continuous infusion over 6 h of endotoxin but did not receive hirudin. All animals were fluid resuscitated with 17 ml/kg/h of saline for the duration of the experiment. Data are expressed as the mean (95% confidence interval). Hirudin reduced the endotoxin-induced consumption of plasma fibrinogen from -110 (-138 to -82) mg/100 ml to -39 (-67 to -12) mg/100 ml (p = 0.0001) and endotoxin-induced increases in the soluble fibrin in plasma from 434 (369 to 499) ng/ml to 236 (171 to 300) ng/ml (p = 0.0002). These data suggest an effective inhibition of the endotoxin-generated thrombin by hirudin. Furthermore, hirudin significantly reduced endotoxin-induced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance from 32 (27 to 37) kdyn x s x cm-5 x kg to 20 (15 to 25) kdyn x s x cm-5 x kg (p = 0.0015) and increases in EVLW from 15.4 (13.2 to 17.6) ml/kg to 12.2 (10.0 to 14.4) ml/kg (p = 0.0299). 
2	Bismuth subsalicylate in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a clinical study. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and placebo were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study as adjunct to rehydration therapy in 123 children, aged 4 to 28 months, hospitalized with acute diarrhea. The dosing regimen was 20 mg/kg five times daily for 5 days. Significant benefits were noted in the BSS group compared with placebo as manifested by decreases in stool frequency and stool weights and an improvement in stool consistency, significant improvement in clinical well-being, and shortening of the disease duration. Patients treated with BSS had a significant reduction in duration of hospital stay (6.9 days) compared with placebo-treated patients (8.5 days). Also, intravenous fluid requirements decreased significantly more rapidly and to a greater degree in the BSS-treated group. Bismuth subsalicylate was associated with clearance of pathogenic Escherichia coli from the stools in 100% of cases but was not different from placebo in rotavirus elimination. Bismuth subsalicylate was well tolerated with no reported adverse effects. Blood bismuth and serum salicylate levels were well below levels considered toxic. In this study, BSS provided effective adjunctive therapy for acute diarrhea, allowing children to get well sooner with less demand on the nursing and hospital staff. 
2	Irritable bowel syndrome in office-based practice in the United States. United States estimates of the frequency of visits to physicians and patterns of medical care for the diagnosis of the irritable bowel syndrome were derived from the 1975, 1980-1981, and 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys. These surveys of office-based physicians allow national estimates of various aspects of ambulatory care. The overall rate of visits with the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in 1980-1981 and 1985 were 10.6 per thousand U.S. population. Women had 2.4 times the rate of visits by men and rates rose in both sexes until middle-age. Irritable bowel syndrome was the leading digestive disease diagnosis among gastroenterologists but only the seventh leading diagnosis among all physicians. Gastrointestinal symptoms, association with mental disorders, prescriptions, and disposition were also examined in patients with visits for irritable bowel syndrome. Among records with digestive tract symptoms and a first listed diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, stomach or abdominal pain was listed on only about one half of records and disorders of bowel function were listed on fewer than 40%. In 1975 and 1985, irritable bowel syndrome was noted approximately twice as often as other digestive diseases at visits with mental disorder symptoms and diagnosis, although mental disorder symptoms and diagnoses were noted at fewer than 15% of visits with irritable bowel syndrome. Medications were prescribed at approximately 75% of visits for irritable bowel syndrome; the most common were gastrointestinal medications followed by combination gastrointestinal-psychoactive medications. Subsequent appointments were scheduled following at least 50% of the visits of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. 
4	Optimum results of the surgical treatment of carotid territory ischemia. Continuing controversy over the role of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention is based largely on reports in which high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates obviate possible long-term benefit from the procedure. The purpose of this review is to examine optimal results of carotid surgery in order to describe the potential for the procedure in stroke prevention. Optimal surgical results are compared with optimal medical results in the therapy of symptomatic patients and with optimal nonsurgical results in the therapy of asymptomatic patients. Factors common to series with excellent results, such as patient selection and operative technique, are examined, and problems such as recurrent carotid stenosis and coexisting coronary disease, which continue to plague even the best surgical series, are discussed. 
4	Perioperative methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) for poor risk transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group pilot study. A total of 18 patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent 2 preoperative cycles of chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin followed by radical cystectomy and 2 postoperative cycles of chemotherapy. Radical cystectomy was performed in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with a pathological partial response in 3 (17%) and a pathological complete response in 2 (11%), for an over-all response rate of 28% (95% confidence limits 10 to 53%). At 23-month median followup 9 patients (50%) remained without evidence of recurrent disease, while 9 (50%) died of metastatic bladder cancer. Average relative dose intensity of all therapy given was 78%. Hematological toxicity was moderate, with no septic deaths or bleeding complications. However, 4 thromboembolic events occurred. While downstaging of the primary bladder tumor can occur with this perioperative schedule our results were not as impressive as some previously reported findings. The incidence of thromboembolic events is worrisome. 
5	Replacement of the aortic valve or root with a pulmonary autograft in children. Between January 1967 and December 1988, 34 patients ranging in age from 3 to 18 years (mean, 14 +/- 3.6 years) underwent replacement of the aortic valve or root with their own pulmonary valve. The indication for operation was left ventricular outflow obstruction in 16 patients (47%), aortic regurgitation in 14 (41%), mixed aortic valve disease in 3 (9%), and failure of a previously implanted aortic homograft in 1 (3%). There were four early deaths, all before 1971, giving a hospital mortality of 11.8% (70% confidence interval, 6% to 20%). Surviving patients have been followed up a cumulative total of 214 patient-years, the longest period of observation being 16 years 8 months. Late mortality was 13.3% (70% confidence interval, 7% to 23%), and 4 other patients required removal of the pulmonary autograft for endocarditis. Actuarial rates at 16 years were 74% +/- 11% for freedom from reoperation on the left ventricular outflow tract, 80% +/- 10% for freedom from reoperation on the right ventricular outflow tract, and 77% +/- 10% for late survival. There was no instance of primary structural degeneration in the pulmonary autograft, and all surviving patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I without medication. This experience demonstrates that the pulmonary autograft can achieve good early and medium-term results in young patients. Should growth potential be realized, it might constitute the ideal biological valve for the left ventricular outflow in children. 
4	Direct monitoring of capillary perfusion following normovolemic hemodilution in an experimental skin-flap model. The effects of normovolemic hemodilution on skin flap survival are studied in a recently developed skin-flap model (homozygous hairless mouse ear) in which nutritional capillary flow is monitored directly by means of intravital microscopy from the time of flap creation throughout the establishment of necrosis. Two diluting agents (dextran 60 and hydroxyethyl starch 200) are utilized. Our quantitative findings demonstrate that the amount of nonperfused tissue following flap creation in both the dextran (n = 23) and starch (n = 13) groups was significantly decreased as compared with controls (n = 19). Our qualitative observations suggest that improved hemorrheologic properties at the microcirculatory level are responsible for the observed decreased necrosis. Various mechanisms by which hemodilution may act to prevent necrosis are discussed. 
4	Effect of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension. The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension. A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks. Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine. Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated. Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered. The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg). Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG. This Ca-entry blocker worked to normalize intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension by dilating afferent arterioles alone. 
3	Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm. We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete. After wound demarcation, we proceeded with debridement and partial-thickness skin grafting. Upper extremity function was totally normal 3 months after this therapy. This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis. 
5	Acute pulmonary oedema on the Ruwenzori mountain range. A 40 year old man had an episode of severe pulmonary oedema at 4000-5000 m during the ascent of the Margherita peak (5109 m) of Mount Stanley on the Ruwenzori. He had taken acetazolamide and high dose dexamethasone to treat symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Six years before he had been studied by right heart catheterisation as a healthy volunteer during hypoxic breathing at sea level. His pulmonary vascular reactivity had been within the normal range for 32 healthy subjects. This man had high altitude pulmonary oedema despite currently recommended treatments for acute mountain sickness and normal pulmonary vascular reactivity to hypoxia at sea level. 
1	Single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography in cancer imaging. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are now being used to improve the information available from radioisotopic imaging of patients with cancer. These nuclear medicine techniques offer the potential for studying regional function and biochemistry by using radiolabeled substrates. The chemical changes of malignancy precede anatomic changes, and PET and/or SPECT may detect these changes before anatomic changes have occurred. The superiority of SPECT compared with planar imaging has been demonstrated for cardiac and brain imaging. Radiopharmaceuticals containing technetium 99 m (99mTc) are best suited for SPECT imaging because large amounts of radioactivity are administered and the collimator-camera systems are optimized for the 140 keV photons of 99mTc. The current interest in imaging cancer with SPECT relates to the use of gallium 67 citrate and monoclonal antibodies labeled with iodine 123 or indium 111. SPECT can image these radioisotopes, but the advantages compared with planar imaging have not been clearly defined. Furthermore, the ability to quantitate the distribution of single photon emitters other than 99mTc has not been demonstrated. New SPECT systems with three heads or rings of detectors offer promise for improved, quantitative imaging. PET has the capability of imaging tracers with the biologically important elements C-11, N-13, O-15, and F-18 used for positron labeling. These radioisotopes have short half-lives and require a cyclotron close to the PET facility. The most prominently used radiopharmaceutical for PET is F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). PET studies with FDG in patients with primary brain tumors have demonstrated the ability to determine the degree of malignancy, to differentiate necrosis from recurrent tumor after radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and to predict prognosis. Other metabolic functions of cancer have been studied, including amino acid accumulation, thymidine uptake, oxygen utilization, intermediary metabolism, and receptor status. PET has the potential to make a major impact on the characterization of a malignancy and the effect of therapy. 
2	Infantile form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency with hepatomuscular symptoms and sudden death. Physiopathological approach to carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiencies. Reported cases of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency are characterized only by a muscular symptomatology in young adults although the defect is expressed in extra-muscular tissues as well as in skeletal muscle. We describe here a CPT II deficiency associating hypoketotic hypoglycemia, high plasma creatine kinase level, heart beat disorders, and sudden death in a 3-mo-old boy. CPT II defect (-90%) diagnosed in fibroblasts is qualitatively similar to that (-75%) of two "classical" CPT II-deficient patients previously studied: It resulted from a decreased amount of CPT II probably arising from its reduced biosynthesis. Consequences of CPT II deficiency studied in fibroblasts differed in both sets of patients. An impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was found in the proband but not in patients with the "classical" form of the deficiency. The metabolic and clinical consequences of CPT II deficiency might depend, in part, on the magnitude of residual CPT II activity. With 25% residual activity CPT II would become rate limiting in skeletal muscle but not in liver, heart, and fibroblasts. As observed in the patient described herein, CPT II activity ought to be more reduced to induce an impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in these tissues. 
1	Posttranslational gastrin processing depends on tumor morphology. Extracellular matrices have recently been demonstrated to alter cell morphology in culture. Altered cell morphology has been associated with changes in gene transcription and translation, but it is not known whether it also affects posttranslational processing. Using tyrosine-O-sulfation as a marker of processing, we studied the effects of various substrates on biologically active gastrin (IRG) production and sulfation in gastrin-containing tumor cells (GT cells). Dispersed GT cells were plated onto different substrates and then incubated. Culture media from days 4, 7, and 28 were assayed with specific antibodies that recognize total IRG and nonsulfated IRG. Cells cultured on plastic and dried films of laminin, collagen, and Matrigel (Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, Mass.) flattened and formed monolayers of GT cells. Cells cultured on a porous membrane and hydrated gels of collagen and Matrigel did not flatten but formed spheroids of GT cells. The monolayer cultures showed an increase in sulfation with time but a decrease in IRG production. The spheroid cultures maintained a constant level of sulfation over time and, with the exception of Matrigel (gel), also showed a decrease in IRG production. These results indicate that the level of sulfation was unchanged from that of the original tumor when cells were grown in spheroids but increased when cultured as monolayers. It appears that alteration of the cellular milieu alters colony morphology, which in turn alters gastrin processing. 
4	Unusual opening of coronary sinus in atrioventricular septal defects. The coronary sinus is an important landmark for the position of the atrial component of the atrioventricular conduction axis and, thus, assumes special relevance to the surgeon in the operating room. We describe here 2 patients with atrioventricular septal defect characterized by an unusual termination of the coronary sinus within the left atrium. We discuss the potential importance of this finding to the disposition and surgical avoidance of the conduction tissues. 
3	Assessment of the components of observed chronic pain behavior: the Checklist for Interpersonal Pain Behavior (CHIP). This article describes the development of the Checklist for Interpersonal Pain Behavior (CHIP), an observation scale which assesses overt pain behavior. The study is an extension of an earlier study in which the dimensions and components of observed chronic pain behavior were examined. A broad definition of pain behavior is chosen (interpersonal pain behavior), namely the interaction between the pain patient and his/her direct environment. The list of pain behaviors, taken from the earlier study, has been transformed into a 78-item global rating scale to be used by nurses to quantify observed pain behavior in a clinical setting. Six studies examine the factor structure and the psychometric properties of this behavioral observation method. In the first study, 6 internally reliable factors are derived using factor analytic techniques from a sample of 152 chronic pain patients. They are labeled as: 'distorted mobility,' 'verbal complaints,' 'non-verbal complaints,' 'nervousness,' 'depression' and 'day sleeping.' Internal consistency of all factors, except 'day sleeping' was excellent. The following studies show that the CHIP is sufficiently reliable and valid. After a discussion on the advantages of this observation scale, the conclusion seems justified that the CHIP is a useful tool in pain assessment that can easily be used by nurses. 
5	The TURP syndrome. This article discusses the presentation, aetiology, treatment and prevention of central nervous system disturbances after transurethral resection of the prostate. Nausea and vomiting, visual symptoms, and altered states of consciousness have been reported as complications due to intravascular absorption of irrigating fluid. Hypotonicity after absorption of the irrigating fluid causes cerebral oedema. Hyperglycinaemia may cause visual disturbances and hyperammonaemia may cause delayed coma. 
3	Venous infarction following the interhemispheric approach in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Postoperative venous infarction following aneurysm surgery was studied in 48 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms operated on through the interhemispheric approach at the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 23 patients whose bridging veins were sacrificed during surgery, 11 (47.8%) showed venous infarction in the frontal lobes. In contrast, only one (5.9%) of 17 patients whose bridging veins were preserved developed cerebral edema. None of eight patients who were operated on after Day 11 (the day of SAH was defined as Day 0) showed this complication, although bridging veins were sacrificed in six of them. Venous infarction following acute aneurysm surgery tended to occur more frequently in patients of higher SAH grade and/or more advanced age, but these correlations were not significant. However, the correlation between the sacrifice of veins and venous infarction was significant (p less than 0.025). Because this potential complication may compromise the benefit of acute aneurysm surgery and cause damage, it is important to preserve the venous system and in some instances to select another surgical approach based on the pattern of venous drainage in the frontal lobe. 
4	Comparison of clinical and electrophysiologic features of preexcitation syndromes in patients presenting initially after age 50 years with those presenting at younger ages. Although patients may develop arrhythmias due to preexcitation syndromes at any time from the prenatal period to late adulthood, presentation in late adulthood is considered uncommon and has not been well studied. From June 1981 to June 1989, 73 patients were documented to have preexcitation syndromes on the basis of electrophysiologic studies. Those whose initial arrhythmias appeared at an age greater than 50 years (group 1, n = 13) were compared with the remaining 60 patients (group 2). All group 1 patients presented in the setting of acute medical or surgical diseases (n = 7), or chronic cardiac disease (n = 6) commonly associated with middle age and often with atrial arrhythmias; only 13 group 2 patients had underlying illnesses (p = 0.0001). Almost two-thirds of group 2 patients were evaluated because of narrow complex orthodromic tachycardia or palpitations and electrocardiographic evidence of preexcitation. Wide complex tachycardia was more often a reason for referral of older patients (7 of 13 vs 11 of 60, p less than 0.05), among whom atrial fibrillation/flutter also tended to be more frequent (4 of 13 vs 11 of 60, difference not significant). The PR and QRS intervals of group 1 patients were within the normal range and differed significantly from those of group 2 patients (PR, 0.15 +/- 0.04 vs 0.11 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001; QRS, 0.09 +/- 0.01 vs 0.12 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001), making electrocardiographic identification of preexcitation more difficult in group 1. Several factors likely contributed. 
3	Etiologic importance of the intimal flap of the external carotid artery in the development of postcarotid endarterectomy stroke. A technically unsatisfactory end point (transition from the removed diseased plaque to normal distal intima) leading to an intimal flap of the external carotid artery has been identified as a source of perioperative stroke. The mechanism involves thrombus formation with retrograde propagation of the thrombus and subsequent embolization of the internal carotid artery. This report describes three cases illustrating this mechanism and methods of identification and correction. This mechanism of postoperative stroke adds further justification for the routine use of intraoperative surveillance studies to document the technical result of endarterectomy involving the internal and external carotid arteries. When an unsatisfactory end point is identified in the external carotid artery, it should be corrected with the same sense of concern as a similar finding in the internal carotid artery. 
2	NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage. A critical review of prophylaxis and therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause acute diffuse injury to the gastroduodenal mucosa, and also cause chronic focal ulcers that may bleed or perforate without warning symptoms. Acute and chronic lesions are distinct, are pathogenetically different, respond differently to drugs, and require different management strategies. The principal rationale for antiulcer therapy in NSAID users is to prevent or reduce potentially fatal outcomes; to date no evaluated drug meets this criterion for efficacy. Antacids and H2-receptor antagonists, based on open uncontrolled studies, appear to heal both gastric and duodenal ulcers, and maintain them healed during continued NSAID use; larger gastric ulcers show delayed healing with conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists during NSAID therapy. No such delay occurs with omeprazole therapy. The suggests that if NSAID-associated gastric ulcers are treated with H2-receptor antagonists, larger doses should be given for longer periods. In patients with no pre-existing ulcer disease, H2-receptor antagonists given prophylactically prevent duodenal but not gastric ulcers; sucralfate does the same. In individuals without peptic ulcer disease taking NSAIDs, misoprostol, given as prophylaxis, reduces the development of gastric ulcers; its beneficial effects on ulcer healing or symptoms during continued NSAID therapy, or its ability to prevent duodenal ulcers or ulcer complications, are not established. Because of diarrhea, the 400 micrograms/day dosage is recommended, especially in the elderly. 
2	Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
3	Presentation and management of an acute caffeine overdose. A one-year-old white female ingested approximately two to three grams of caffeine (200-300 mg/kg). The patient survived the ingestion with a maximum caffeine concentration of 385 micrograms/ml four hours postingestion. The child developed ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and severe pulmonary edema. She survived without apparent long-term sequelae despite having reached a serum caffeine concentration that is the second highest reported level in a survivor. 
5	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: report of 82 cases. In our initial experience with 82 patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown numerous advantages over open cholecystectomy. Both intraoperative blood loss and postoperative need for pain medication have been minimal. Most patients were discharged within 24 to 36 hours and resumed normal activities within 3 to 5 days. The aesthetic aspect is also an obvious advantage, since the laparoscopic procedure avoids disfiguring abdominal scars. Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication to attempting this procedure. Based on our experience, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely on most patients who are candidates for open cholecystectomy, including the elderly, the obese, and those with acute gangrenous cholecystitis. 
1	The value of nucleolar organizer regions in uveal melanoma. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study Group. Silver staining of nucleolar organizer regions is an objective method for evaluating the malignancy of a variety of tumors. We studied 126 ciliochoroidal melanomas, three coincidental nevi that occurred in eyes with melanomas, and one magnocellular nevus collected from the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study to determine the effectiveness of the silver-stained nucleolar organizer region technique in assessing the malignant potential of these tumors. Malignant lesions demonstrated higher mean silver-stained nucleolar organizer region counts (4.347) than benign nevi (1.855) (P less than or equal to .0001). Among malignant melanomas, mixed-cell melanomas had slightly higher counts than spindle-cell melanomas (P less than or equal to .0001), but this difference was not important clinically. Results were also compared to other histopathologic variables, which disclosed correlation of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions with mitoses and tumor size. Comparison with computerized cytomorphometric analyses of prognosis also disclosed significant correlation. This technique may prove to be a useful adjunct in the assessment of malignancy and treatment response of uveal melanomas. 
1	The changing face of dermatology out-patient referrals in the south-east of Scotland. A study of out-patient dermatological services (NHS and private) in the south-east of Scotland was carried out by medical staff in the Department of Dermatology in Edinburgh during the month of November 1988. The aim was to assess changes in referral patterns and workload compared with the findings of an identical investigation undertaken in November 1981. Of particular interest were the possible effects of recent publicity campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about skin cancer. The medical complement of the dermatology department had changed minimally since 1981 and the population increase in the south-east of Scotland over the same period was 1.5%. During November 1988 1592 new patients and 2037 review patients were seen. This represented an increase of 29.2% and 28.3%, respectively, since 1981. The most striking changes in diagnostic groups were a 173% rise in new cases presenting with benign tumours (excluding viral warts) and a 106% increase in new patients with malignant tumours. Viral warts and eczema were, as in 1981, the second and third most common diagnostic categories amongst new patients. There was a 98% increase in the number of surgical procedures performed on new patients compared with 1981. We conclude that the substantial increase in numbers of both benign and malignant tumours and the consequent doubling in surgical treatments was due to increased public awareness and concern about skin cancer. 
1	Caseating hepatic granulomas in Hodgkin's lymphoma. A 68-year-old man presented with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma after a 9-year disease-free interval induced by chemotherapy. In addition to histological evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, the liver biopsy specimen showed extensive caseating granulomas. Cultures of bone marrow and liver tissue tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No antituberculous treatment was administered, and the patient had an excellent clinical response to additional chemotherapy for lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma should be added to the list of disease entities associated with caseating granulomas in the liver. 
5	Reliability of the clinical and electromyographic examination of tendon reflexes. The reliability of clinical examination of the tendon reflexes was examined by studying inter-observer agreement. Twenty patients were examined by three neurologists. The briskness of the tendon reflexes in arms and legs was scored on a nine-point scale. In 28% of the 160 examined reflexes the observations disagreed 2 scale units or more. Disagreement on the presence of asymmetry occurred in 45% of the 80 reflex pairs. In 15% one observer judged a reflex pair to be symmetrical while another observer found asymmetry of at least 2 scale units. In a second experiment clinical observation of apparently asymmetrical quadriceps reflexes was compared with measurement by surface electromyography. A significant, semi-logarithmic relationship was found between clinical scores and measured reflex amplitudes. Measured reflex asymmetry always agreed with clinical asymmetry, and the magnitudes of right-left amplitude differences were correlated with the magnitude of clinically observed asymmetry. The bedside examination of tendon reflexes is subject to considerable inter-observer disagreement. 
4	Stress and sudden death. The case of the long QT syndrome. The idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) represents a unique clinical example of stress-related sudden cardiac death. LQTS is characterized by the association of several distinctive electrocardiographic features, among which prolongation of the QT interval is the best known, with life-threatening arrhythmias that usually occur under conditions of physical or psychological stress. Effective therapies exist and are represented by antiadrenergic interventions; beta-adrenergic-blocking agents are the treatment of choice. When they fail, left cardiac sympathetic denervation has also proven to be very effective. The latter result suggests a role for alpha-adrenergic mechanisms in the arrhythmias of LQTS. The stressors more frequently associated with syncopal events in LQTS patients include fear, exercise fraught with emotions, swimming, and awakening because of a loud noise. Experimentally, life threatening arrhythmias have been induced during a highly emotional situation in conscious cats with normal hearts in which right stellate ganglia have been ablated, resulting in QT interval prolongation. This selective denervation creates a sympathetic imbalance of the type proposed by one of the pathogenetic hypotheses for LQTS. 
4	Are ioxaglate and iopamidol equally safe and well tolerated in cardiac angiography? A randomized, double-blind clinical study. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was performed in 50 patients undergoing left ventriculography and coronary arteriography to evaluate ECG changes and the effects on left ventricular function of a low-osmolar ionic contrast agent, ioxaglate, as compared with a low-osmolar nonionic contrast medium, iopamidol. Twenty-five patients received ioxaglate (group 1) and 25 patients received iopamidol (group 2). All patients underwent 48 hours of continuous ECG recording beginning 24 hours before the cardiac catheterization. Left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, peak positive dp/dt, and dp/dt/P ratio were measured immediately before and after left ventriculography and 3 minutes later. Left ventricular systolic pressure did not change after injection of either contrast medium. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased by 30% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and by 22% in group 2 (p less than 0.01) immediately after left ventriculography. A further increase by 45% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and by 24% in group 2 (p less than 0.01) was observed 3 minutes later. No differences were observed between values obtained in the two groups. Peak positive dp/dt did not change immediately after injection of either contrast medium but decreased by 5% (not significant) in group 1 and by 7% (p less than 0.02) in group 2 three minutes after left ventriculography. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Analysis of continuous 48-hour ECGs showed that both ioxaglate and iopamidol induced a slight increase (by 8% and 7%, respectively; p less than 0.05) in heart rate during injection with early and complete recovery. 
1	Ovarian metastases are rare in stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Over a 32-year period at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, all cases of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix were reviewed to determine the incidence of ovarian metastases in stage I disease. One of 25 patients (4.0%) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and radical hysterectomy had a microscopic ovarian metastasis. A literature review identified nine additional patients who had ovarian metastases and stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Including our series, the overall reported rate of ovarian metastases is 1.8%. All ten patients had at least one of the following additional characteristics: They were postmenopausal, they had adnexal pathology, or they had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Thus, ovarian preservation is warranted in premenopausal patients who do not have ovarian pathology or evidence of other metastatic disease at surgery. Bilateral oophorectomy may be performed if frozen-section examination of enlarged or suspicious nodes documents metastases. If the ovaries are left in the pelvis at the completion of the surgical procedure and microscopic spread to other pelvic tissues is documented, pelvic irradiation can be administered. 
3	Ventilatory function as a predictor of fatal stroke. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between ventilatory function and subsequent mortality due to cerebrovascular disease. DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal study. SUBJECTS--A total of 18,403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years at entry examination for the Whitehall study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (ICD8 430-438) after 18 years of follow up. RESULTS--In all, 262 men with sinus rhythm at entry died due to stroke during the 18 years of follow up. Compared with men with a forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than or equal to 3.5 litres those with a value of less than 3.0 litres were almost twice as likely to die of cerebrovascular disease (rate ratio adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure = 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.69). This increased risk occurred within each tertile of systolic blood pressure. Nested case-control analyses were used to control precisely for confounding effects of age, height, and smoking (by matching) and employment grade and physiological risk factors (by modelling). The effect of forced expiratory volume in one second was independent of age, height, smoking habits, employment grade, blood pressure, weight, cholesterol concentration, glucose tolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, history of chest pain, and history of intermittent claudication. CONCLUSIONS--Measurements of ventilatory function may assist clinical decisions about whether to treat mild hypertension. Impaired ventilatory function and stroke may share common causes. 
5	Percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Operative drainage is the cornerstone of therapy for pancreatic abscess. Recently it has been suggested that successful percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections may serve as definitive therapy. We undertook therapeutic, computed tomography-directed percutaneous drainage in a selected group of 29 patients with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Twenty-three patients (79%) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Of six patients (21%) representing failures of percutaneous drainage, four died and two recovered after operative drainage. The four patients who died had a mean APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23 and five of Ranson's prognostic signs. Ranson's signs and APACHE II scores were predictive of success and mortality. We conclude that in selected patients, infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections can be treated definitively with therapeutic percutaneous catheter drainage. Based on this experience, recommendations regarding patient selection are included. 
3	Temporal lobectomy and independent bitemporal interictal activity: what degree of lateralization is sufficient? We attempted to determine whether the degree of lateralization of independent bitemporal interictal spikes and sharp waves (ISSW) is correlated with good results after temporal lobectomy. Three observers independently counted ISSW in the scalp EEGs of 59 candidates for temporal lobectomy to determine the degree of lateralization of ISSW. Interobserver correlation in percentage of lateralization was excellent (r = 0.92). Thirty-one candidates were also evaluated with depth EEG (DEEG). Operative success was graded by the number of seizures reported in the second postoperative year. There was a significant progressive decrease in the number of good operative results as the degree of lateralization of ISSW lessened (p = 0.0142). Ninety-two percent of patients with greater than 90% lateralization had a good surgical outcome, whereas only 50% with less than 90% lateralization had a good outcome. Even when all DEEG-recorded seizures emerged from the side of the lobectomy, patients with greater than 90% lateralization appeared to have better outcomes than patients with less than 90% lateralization. We conclude that greater than 90% lateralization of temporal ISSW is associated with good surgical outcome, and DEEG may not be necessary in these patients. Less than 90% lateralization is associated with poor surgical outcome and the additional information provided by DEEG may be especially useful in such patients. 
5	Reduction in bleeding after heart-lung transplantation. The importance of posterior mediastinal hemostasis. To reduce perioperative hemorrhage following heart-lung transplantation, several technical modifications were introduced in June 1988 to secure better posterior mediastinal hemostasis. The intraoperative and postoperative use of blood and blood products, as well as the chest tube drainage in the first 24 hours postoperatively, were compared in the seven patients operated on since June 1988 with the nine patients operated on before that date. Significant (p less than 0.05) reductions were demonstrated in the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion of packed cells, in the postoperative administration of fresh frozen plasma, and in the chest tube drainage within the first 24 hours postoperatively. The one-month and total hospital mortality rates were 6 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. It is concluded that newer techniques to obtain optimal posterior mediastinal hemostasis have significantly reduced blood loss following heart-lung transplantation in our experience and have contributed to our excellent early postoperative results. 
4	US-assisted aspiration thrombectomy: in vitro investigations. The authors describe the use of a new ultrasound (US)-aspiration thrombectomy technique. An oscillating US probe was inserted into a thin-walled, large-bore aspiration catheter. Experiments tested the ability of the new device and other catheter combinations to remove clot material from a Petri dish, as well as from small and large vessel models made of silicone and glass tubes, respectively. Results of the experiments demonstrated that an oscillating 1.0-mm US probe inserted into an aspiration catheter (7-9 F in diameter) promoted clot fragmentation and allowed continuous aspiration of thrombi of any size. When compared with simple large-bore catheter aspiration and with mechanical fragmentation by means of a US probe within a catheter that was flushed to cool the probe, US-assisted aspiration thrombectomy demonstrated significantly better results for percutaneous transcatheter removal of fresh thrombi. 
1	Manometric evaluation of jejunal limb after total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr anastomosis for gastric cancer. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomosis is frequently performed for gastric cancer. Since intestinal motility of the Roux limb has never been evaluated after this operation, pressure activity was investigated in the Roux limb of ten patients (aged 51-77 years) who had undergone total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr reconstruction. Investigations were carried out during a 6-h fast and 3 h after a 605 kcal mixed meal. During fasting only two patients had activity fronts and these were abnormal. All ten patients displayed non-propagating bursts of contractions and three had discrete clustered contractions and high amplitude jejunal contractions. The fed state was characterized by a severely reduced motor activity pattern and other abnormalities. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomoses provokes a relatively severe disturbance in intestinal activity. 
5	Gastrointestinal side-effects of octreotide during long-term treatment of acromegaly. Gastrointestinal side-effects of prolonged therapy (greater than 2 yr) with the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide were studied in 10 acromegalic patients. After 2 yr of therapy, 6 of 10 patients had newly developed gallstones, complicated by cholangitis and jaundice in 1. Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations declined in all 10 patients [from 380 +/- 32 to 172 +/- 21 pmol/L (mean +/- SE); P = 0.023] and became abnormally low in 4. Gastric biopsy specimens, obtained during gastroscopy (9 patients), showed moderate to severe active gastritis, with damage to the superficial and deeper layers of the mucosa in 9 of 9 and focal atrophy in 7 of 9 patients. Campylobacter pylori was found in the antral mucosa in 8 of 9 patients. Although information is lacking on similar studies in untreated acromegalic patients, we suggest that patients receiving chronic octreotide therapy be closely monitored for these and possible other side-effects related to gastrointestinal actions of octreotide. 
4	Concealed entrainment as a guide for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients with prior myocardial infarction. Fifteen consecutive patients with drug-refractory, recurrent, sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and a history of remote myocardial infarction underwent catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia. Shocks of 100 to 300 J were delivered to sites at which pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in concealed entrainment, in which the ventricular tachycardia accelerated to the pacing rate, there was a long stimulus to QRS interval and there was no change in the configuration of the QRS complex during pacing at several rates compared with the configuration during ventricular tachycardia, thus identifying a zone of slow conduction in the reentrant circuit. Concealed entrainment was demonstrated in nine (60%) of 15 patients, and the stimulus to QRS intervals were 90 to 400 ms. At sites of concealed entrainment, the endocardial activation time relative to the QRS complex during ventricular tachycardia ranged from -125 to +50 ms, the timing of the local electrogram relative to the QRS complex was the same during entrainment as during ventricular tachycardia and the pace map during sinus rhythm was discordant with that of the ventricular tachycardia in seven patients. In the six patients in whom a site of concealed entrainment could not be identified, the target site for ablation was selected on the basis of identification of an isolated mid-diastolic potential, activation mapping and pace mapping. The mean (+/- SD) cumulative number of joules delivered to the target site was 306 +/- 140. A successful long-term clinical outcome was achieved in 9 of the 15 patients (mean follow-up 20 +/- 7 months). The clinical success rate was the same whether the target site was selected on the basis of concealed entrainment (five of nine, 56%) or on the basis of the other mapping techniques (four of six, 67%). In conclusion, the responses to pacing suggest that sites at which there is concealed entrainment may be located within a zone of slow conduction in the ventricular tachycardia reentry circuit, although not necessarily in an area critical for the maintenance of reentry. The long-term clinical efficacy of catheter ablation targeted to sites of concealed entrainment is about 60%, similar to the results achieved when conventional mapping techniques are used. 
4	Surgical treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. From 1980 to 1989, 53 patients with renovascular hypertension underwent surgical treatment after initial unsuccessful management with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Renal artery stenosis was due to fibrous dysplasia in 17 patients and atherosclerosis in 36. The reasons for failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were inability to dilate the stenotic lesion (32 patients), acute renal arterial occlusion (2) or dissection (8) from attempted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and the development of recurrent renal artery stenosis after initially successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (11). Three patients underwent nephrectomy due to the finding of a nonviable kidney at operation. Successful surgical revascularization was achieved in 50 patients. There was no significant fibrosis or inflammation around the previously dilated renal artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty necessitated performance of a more complicated revascularization operation in only 1 patient. If the kidney is viable at operation in patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty renovascular reconstruction is not more technically difficult than when done primarily and the same excellent results can be achieved. 
5	Relationship of drusen and abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium to the prognosis of neovascular macular degeneration. The Macular Photocoagulation Study Group. We graded macular features of 127 fellow eyes of participants in the Macular Photocoagulation Study who had an extrafoveal choroidal neovascular membrane secondary to age-related macular degeneration in the first eye and no initial evidence of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration in the fellow eye. Our aims were to determine the relationship of drusen characteristics and retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities to the risk of subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye and the risk of subsequent development of recurrent neovascular membranes after photocoagulation in the first eye. Regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of large drusen and focal hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium were independent risk factors for the subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye (relative risk, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively). Only 10% of eyes with no large drusen or any retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation compared with 58% of eyes with both large drusen and retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation developed neovascularization in the fellow eye within 5 years. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we noted that the risk of developing recurrent neovascular membranes in the first eye was significantly increased when large drusen (relative risk, 2.8) were noted in the fellow eye at the time of laser treatment in the first eye. Fundus features in the fellow eye appear to help identify patients at high risk of developing visual loss from recurrent neovascular membranes following laser treatment in the first eye and from development of a neovascular membrane in the fellow eye. 
4	Putative mechanism of blood pressure reduction induced by increases in dietary calcium intake. An increase in dietary calcium intake lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in some patients with arterial hypertension. The mechanisms by which this decrease come about are not clear. A membrane-stabilizing effect wrought by an increase in extracellular calcium would appear unlikely, since the increases in extracellular calcium concentration with increased dietary intake are minimal. Calcium regulatory hormones may be the mediators, and a cybernetic framework has been suggested. Striking defects have been reported in the calcium handling and hormonal household of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. However, a clear cut relationship in terms of a hormonal "template" has not yet been identified in prospective experiments. Data have been presented to show that increased calcium intake has a direct effect on regulatory areas in the brain. However, the mechanisms by which such a response would be mediated are entirely unknown. Increased calcium intake may induce natriuresis. It has been suggested that increased calcium intake helps the "salt sensitive"; however, prospective studies to this effect have not been presented. Increased calcium intake may induce phosphaturia. However, the evidence that blood pressure lowering effects are mediated by phosphate depletion are unconvincing. Some evidence suggests that increased calcium intake may influence local regulatory processes which in turn influences cell integrity and growth. At this point, a unifying hypothesis is not available. However, the clues to various possibilities are intriguing. 
4	Adjunctive use of beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists and other therapies in coronary thrombolysis. The availability of thrombolytic agents for use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is an important step in the management of a common, often debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder. However, despite the proven benefits of coronary thrombolysis, the importance of adjunctive treatment modalities is being increasingly recognized. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, nitrates, magnesium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors each exert favorable cardiovascular properties that may offer additional benefits. Clinical trials combining thrombolytic and adjunctive pharmacologic agents offer hope for further advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. 
3	Right parietal stroke with Gerstmann's syndrome. Appearance on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single-photon emission computed tomography. We examined a patient who exhibited Gerstmann's syndrome (left-right disorientation, finger agnosia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia) in association with a perioperative stroke in the right parietal lobe. This is the first description of the Gerstmann tetrad occurring in the setting of discrete right hemisphere pathologic findings. A well-localized vascular lesion was demonstrated by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single-photon emission computed tomographic studies. The patient had clinical evidence of reversed functional cerebral dominance and radiologic evidence of reversed anatomic cerebral asymmetries. 
3	Rett syndrome and the autistic disorders. Rett syndrome is a disorder noted to date only in females and characterized by a pervasive developmental disability following apparently normal early infancy. In addition to gait difficulties, stereotypic hand movements, and loss of communication and purposeful hand skills, autistic-like behavior is an early sign that often results in misdiagnosis. Despite these significant clinical abnormalities, neuropathologic features are modest, and no consistent laboratory abnormality or diagnostic marker has been identified. The current status of research in RS is considered within the context of autism and other disorders in which autistic features may occur, such as the fragile X syndrome. The concept of autism as neurobiologically based behavior is developed. As such, autism is regarded as an umbrella category containing an ever-expanding list of specific disorders. 
5	Altered pattern of calcium kinetics in hemodialysis patients after parathyroidectomy. Six HD patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) underwent studies of calcium kinetics prior to and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) with autotransplantation. Postoperatively, patients received vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Before PTX, a markedly elevated bone turnover was found, with increased fluxes of calcium from plasma into the exchangeable calcium pool. This pool was three times larger than normal, indicating a high risk of extraosseous calcifications. Despite a marked fall in parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels after PTX, bone cell activity was maintained, as indicated by elevated values for Ca retention. Although Ca efflux from plasma into other compartments of the exchangeable pools remained above normal, the size of the total exchangeable calcium pool markedly decreased after PTX, indicating that PTX with autotransplantation, followed by vitamin D therapy, can normalize bone turnover and shift the balance of calcium flux towards mineralized bone. Reduction in the exchangeable calcium pool may explain the clinical finding that extraosseous calcifications regress in some patients after PTX. 
4	Silent ischemia after coronary angioplasty: evaluation of restenosis and extent of ischemia in asymptomatic patients by tomographic thallium-201 exercise imaging and comparison with symptomatic patients. One hundred sixteen patients were evaluated to determine the ability of single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium-201 exercise and redistribution imaging to detect silent ischemia secondary to restenosis in asymptomatic patients after single and multiple vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the findings were compared with SPECT imaging detection of restenosis in symptomatic patients. The value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and the amount of ischemic myocardium in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were determined. Forty-one patients were asymptomatic after angioplasty; 77% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Seventy-five patients had chest pain after angioplasty; 99% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Restenosis occurred in 61% of asymptomatic and 59% of symptomatic patients and in 46% of the vessels in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of restenosis by SPECT in individual patients were 96%, 75% and 88% versus 91%, 77% and 85%, respectively, in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic groups (p = NS). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for restenosis detection in individual vessels were 90%, 89% and 89% versus 84%, 77% and 84%, respectively, in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups (p = NS), with similar results for the three major arteries. Sensitivity and accuracy of exercise ECG were significantly less than those of SPECT imaging for the patients with silent (40% and 44%) and symptomatic (59% and 64%) ischemia (p less than 0.001). Restenosis of vessels in the patients with silent and symptomatic ischemia was associated with an equal amount and degree of severity of ischemic myocardium in the two groups. 
1	Intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor causes a cutaneous eruption The intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to three patients with leukemia who were receiving marrow aplasia-inducing chemotherapy resulted in the development of wide-spread erythematous macules and papules. The course of the eruption paralleled the time of infusion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Skin biopsy specimens taken from two of the eruptions displayed characteristic changes consisting of a variable mixture of granulocytes and lymphocytes, increased number and size of dermal macrophages, mild to moderate epidermal exocytosis, intercellular edema, and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis of one specimen was notable for keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Administration of the recombinant human cytokine in pharmacologic doses is postulated to induce changes in the immunologic status of the skin, resulting in the expression of a cutaneous eruption. 
3	Stiff-man syndrome: a GABAergic autoimmune disorder with autoantigenic heterogeneity. Autoantibodies that reacted with cell bodies and axon terminals of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons were present in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid in a patient with stiff-man syndrome with type I diabetes. Immunoblot experiments using this patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid did not corroborate an earlier observation that these autoantibodies are directed against the GABAergic cytosolic enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. While L-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies may be associated with this syndrome, they do not appear to be easily demonstrated. 
4	Experience with in situ saphenous vein bypasses during 1981 to 1989: determinant factors of long-term patency. From 1981 to 1989, 361 consecutive in situ saphenous vein bypasses were performed. Indications for revascularization were critical limb ischemia (n = 335, 93%), popliteal aneurysm (n = 15, 4%), and claudication (n = 11, 3%). Outflow tract was the popliteal artery in 116 (32%) and tibial artery in 245 (68%) of bypasses. At 6 years primary patency was 63% and secondary patency was 81%. During the performance of the in situ bypass procedure, 86 (24%) venous conduits were modified because of a technical failure (n = 49, 13%) or an inadequate vein segment (n = 37, 10%). Secondary patency at 4 years for bypasses requiring modification was 72% compared to 84% for bypasses not modified (p less than 0.05). Atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery necessitating endarterectomy, patch angioplasty, or replacement lowered primary patency at 3 years (69%) compared to the inflow artery not requiring reconstruction (46%, p less than 0.02). In the follow-up period, 95 (26%) bypasses were revised because of thrombosis or hemodynamic failure. Bypasses requiring revision had a 4-year secondary patency of 68% compared to 88% for bypasses not revised (p less than 0.02). The first 179 cases (1981 to 1985) were compared to the subsequent 182 cases (1986 to 1989). The secondary patency at 3 years for the latter half (92%) compared to the first half (80%) of the experience was significantly improved (p less than 0.02). The secondary patency for bypasses not requiring revision was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) for the latter half (n = 142, 97%) compared to the first half (n = 124, 83%) of the series. Long-term patency with the in situ saphenous vein bypass is dependent on surgical experience, quality of the venous conduit, and atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery that necessitates reconstruction. Meticulous surgical technique and compulsive bypass surveillance results in superior long-term patency. 
2	Role of the protease-antiprotease balance in peritoneal exudate during acute pancreatitis. The peritoneal exudate formed during experimental pancreatitis is toxic when administered intraperitoneally or intravenously to other animals. Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiprotease defences by proteolytic enzymes released from the pancreas may be a key factor responsible for this toxicity and is examined in the current study. Human pancreatitis exudates possessed tryptic amidase activity indicating trypsinogen activation. The trypsin inhibitory capacities of exudates were reduced indicating a degree of consumption of the peritoneal antiproteases. Of 21 exudates examined, three showed marked reduction of their trypsin inhibitory capacity indicating almost complete consumption of their antiproteases. All three patients were shocked at the time of sampling, two dying of fulminant pancreatitis within 24 h. Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiproteases was not confirmed, but may occur in a few instances where proteolytic enzyme release or zymogen activation continues. Intraperitoneal administration of exogenous antiproteases prolongs survival in rats with pancreatitis and has been suggested as a therapy in man. The current data suggests that few patients are likely to benefit from such an approach. 
5	Assessment of dilation methods in achalasia: large diameter mercury bougienage followed by pneumatic dilation as needed. In a retrospective study, 33 achalasia patients were treated with dilation therapy using large diameter mercury bougienage (mean, 56 French) and/or pneumatic balloon dilation. Mean follow-up time was 35 months. Mercury bougienage, performed in 20 patients, was successful in 10 (50%) with no complications. Pneumatic dilation was performed as initial therapy or in those having failed previous pharmacologic therapy and/or bougienage. A successful response was achieved in 19 of 23 patients (83%), with a 3.2% complication rate. In addition, in four patients with eventual recurrence of symptoms after initial pneumatic dilation, bougienage was used as a successful alternative to repeat pneumatic treatment. The combined efficacy of both forms of dilation was 88% with a complication rate of 1.4%. These data indicate that mercury bougienage should be considered initial therapy for achalasia in view of its simplicity, safety, and acceptable efficacy, followed by pneumatic dilation if bougienage is unsuccessful. Bougienage also may be considered if eventual recurrent symptoms develop after initially successful pneumatic dilation. Surgery should be utilized only if dilation therapy fails to achieve a satisfactory response. 
1	An unusual epidural, vascular spinal lipoma in a 3-year-old child: a case report and review of the literature. Epidural lipomas are usually benign tumors affecting the spinal cord. We report the unusual presentation of a cervicothoracic spinal lipoma associated with a cervical dysraphism in a young boy. Diagnostic options using magnetic resonance imaging and gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid are discussed as a pathway to early diagnosis of these and other occult spinal lesions. 
4	Quantitative assessment of ultrasonic myocardial reflectivity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between acoustic properties of the myocardium and magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An on-line radio frequency analysis system was used to obtain quantitative operator-independent measurements of the integrated backscatter signal of the ventricular septum and posterior free wall in 25 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 25 normal age-matched control subjects. The integrated values of the radio frequency signal were normalized for the pericardial interface and expressed in percent. Tissue reflectivity was significantly increased in the hypertrophied ventricular septum, as well as in the nonhypertrophied posterior free wall, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (58 +/- 15% and 37 +/- 12%, respectively) compared with values in normal subjects (33 +/- 10% and 18 +/- 5%, respectively; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, measurements of reflectivity of the septum or posterior free wall, or both, were beyond 2 SD of normal values in greater than 90% of the patients and were also abnormal in each of the five study patients who had only mild and localized left ventricular hypertrophy. No correlation was identified between myocardial tissue reflectivity and left ventricular wall thickness in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (correlation coefficient r = 0.4; p = NS). These findings demonstrate that myocardial reflectivity is abnormal in most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is largely independent of the magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, quantitative analysis of ultrasonic reflectivity can differentiate patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from normal subjects independently of clinical features and conventional echocardiographic measurements. 
4	Significance of discordant ST alternans in ventricular fibrillation. With the use of epicardial mapping, we investigated the electrical alternans of the ST segment during acute myocardial ischemia and studied the difference in ST alternans between dogs with resultant ventricular fibrillation and those without it. During the 7-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery below its first diagonal branch, 60 epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously at 1-minute intervals by a computerized mapping system. ST alternans was found in the eight dogs we observed. The amplitude of ST alternans (difference in the ST segment elevation of two consecutive electrograms) was greater in dogs with ventricular fibrillation (n = 4) than in those without it (n = 4) (3.92 +/- 1.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.49 mV, p less than 0.05). Three of the four dogs with ventricular fibrillation demonstrated discordant ST alternans (i.e., adjacent leads were out of phase). Results from the present study indicate that an increased amplitude and discordance of ST alternans during acute myocardial ischemia are related to ventricular fibrillation and act as indicators of time and spatial unevenness of ventricular repolarization. 
5	Future needs for ERCP: incidence of conditions leading to bile duct obstruction and requirements for diagnostic and therapeutic biliary procedures. Although the development of endoscopic methods of treatment for biliary obstruction has proceeded rapidly in recent years, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) services are patchily distributed. A recent survey by the British Society of Gastroenterology has shown that almost half the district general hospitals questioned did not have a sphincterotomy service available locally. To assess the level of provision required, two investigations have been undertaken. Firstly, an epidemiological study of bile duct obstruction has been carried out in the South Western Region. Secondly, the actual surgical and endoscopic workload in treating obstructive jaundice has been analysed in two health districts. Using present incidence and treatment rates at least 50 ERCPs per 100,000 of the population per year are estimated to be required in the future. Surgical treatment rates can be expected to fall as the number of therapeutic ERCPs increases. The implications of this estimate in equipment and staffing terms are discussed. 
1	Selective catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses: new catheter design. Catheters for selective catheterization of the right and left inferior petrosal sinuses have been developed to replace the complex tip-deflector catheter-guide-wire system currently used. The new catheters are easily formed from commonly available straight catheters with the use of steam. They have been successfully tested in 22 patients; the only complications were minor groin hematomas. 
1	Diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by means of recombinant Epstein-Barr virus proteins. The immune response of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens is diagnostic of the tumour. Existing tests use EBV antigens produced in EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells, but the virus replicates poorly in these cells. Serum samples from 18 patients diagnosed as having nasopharyngeal carcinoma were screened by western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence tests for antibodies to the EBV-coded alkaline deoxyribonuclease (DNase), thymidine kinase, and membrane antigen (gp340/220) produced in recombinant baculovirus or bovine papillomavirus systems. Each protein was a useful diagnostic marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although in the gp340/220 ELISAs there was substantial overlap for both IgG and IgA antibodies between serum samples from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and those from healthy donors seropositive for EBV. The EBV thymidine kinase was the most sensitive predictor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; all such samples showed both IgG and IgA antibody responses to this protein and all gave clearly distinct titres from those of the EBV-seropositive donors in the IgA test. Each of the recombinant systems described is suitable for use in large-scale screening programmes for the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
1	Family cancer syndrome: a study of the kindred of a man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible. Several familial cancer syndromes have been identified. The syndrome of sarcomas, breast cancer and other neoplasms, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, is characterized by several different neoplasms presenting at young ages with autosomal dominant transmission and a high incidence of second primaries. In this paper, we studied six generations (51 people) of the family of a 24-year-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible. Twelve malignancies in 11 people, including several rare tumors, were revealed. Mean age of presentation was 24 years old. Nine of the 11 patients died of disease. One developed a second primary. Two tumors presented in the head and neck. Transmission was autosomal dominant. The karyotypes of two family members were normal. Identification of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a family is important in determining appropriate follow-up for the patient and family. Such families are models for studying carcinogenesis. 
1	Colon carcinoma associated with ureterosigmoidostomy. A patient developing a colonic adenoma 38 years following ureterosigmoidostomy is presented. The mechanisms of neoplastic transformation associated with ureterosigmoidostomy is now better understood. This knowledge is being applied to develop modifications both of the surgical technique and the management of patients with this form of urinary diversion, and is a subject of discussion. 
5	Ultrasonography in patients with suspected acute appendicitis: a prospective study. The diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution real-time ultrasonography was prospectively studied in 240 patients admitted to the hospital with suspected acute appendicitis. The criteria for ultrasound diagnosis of appendicitis included a sausage-shaped, aperistaltic, hypoechoic structure when imaged along its longitudinal axis, with a target-like appearance on transverse section. The ultrasonographic findings were correlated with surgical-pathological outcome in 82 cases with proven appendicitis, with laparotomy findings in another 21 patients and with clinical follow-up in the remainder. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 78%, 92% and 87%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 84% and the negative predictive value was 88%. Ultrasonography may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and should be performed in all patients in whom the clinical diagnosis is equivocal. The ultrasonographic findings must be interpreted in light of the clinical findings. 
1	Adult respiratory distress syndrome after limited resection of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Two cases of the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after limited resection for lung carcinoma. No other known precipitants were evident. The adult respiratory distress syndrome is a clinical expression of acute lung injury that may arise from various insults and include air and blood borne factors. Tumour related blood borne factors may have contributed to lung injury in these cases. 
1	Detection of colorectal liver metastases using intraoperative ultrasonography. Intraoperative ultrasonography of the liver has been carried out in 99 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Palpation of the liver, preoperative abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scanning were also performed in all patients. Metastases were identified in 26 of the 99 patients (26 per cent). Intraoperative ultrasonography diagnosed more metastases than palpation, abdominal ultrasonography or CT scanning, identifying metastases in 24 of the 26 patients, including six patients in whom the metastases were not detected by any other technique. Identification and localization of impalpable liver metastases is therefore possible using intraoperative ultrasonography. 
4	Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention. All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic. Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction. "Cortical" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement. Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis. 
5	Expression of the human papillomavirus E7 oncogene during cell transformation is sufficient to induce susceptibility to lysis by activated macrophages. Human papillomaviruses (HPV), and in particular HPV type 16, are etiologic agents in the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide. Mammalian cells are susceptible to transformation in vitro by the E6 and E7 oncogenes derived from the HPV-16 genome. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 oncogene were found to exhibit cytolytic susceptibility to murine-activated macrophages. In comparison, E6 oncogene-expressing cells were not susceptible to lysis by activated macrophages. The E7 oncoprotein is multifunctional, being capable of complexing with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (anti-oncogene) product, stimulating DNA synthesis, and causing cell transformation in vitro. Macrophage killing assays performed on cell lines expressing E7 mutants revealed that the ability to complex the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product and stimulate DNA synthesis did not induce susceptibility to activated macrophages, whereas the ability of E7 to cause transformation was required to induce susceptibility to activated macrophages. These data suggest that cell transformation is a more important prerequisite for inducing susceptibility to activated macrophages than is the loss of tumor suppressor gene function. This study also provides an initial link between HPV-16 oncogene expression and the ability of activated macrophages to selectively recognize and destroy HPV-16-associated neoplastic cells. 
5	A comparison between single and double dose intravenous Timentin for the prophylaxis of wound infection in elective colorectal surgery. A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was undertaken to determine whether two doses of systemic Timentin provided superior prophylaxis against postoperative sepsis in elective colorectal surgery compared with a single dose of the same antibiotic. Timentin, a combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid was administered intravenously (3.1 g) at the commencement of operation to all patients, and this was repeated after 2 hours in those patients randomized to receive a second dose. The wound infection rate was 11 percent in the 143 patients completing follow-up and receiving a single dose, and 13 percent in the 128 patients receiving two doses of Timentin (P greater than 0.05). The rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. Multivariate analysis of the factors likely to affect postoperative would infection rate demonstrated an association with the type of hospital, public or private, wound infection rate 16 and 6 percent, respectively (P less than 0.01), and the surgeon group defined by the number of patients contributed greater than 25 or less than 25, wound infection rate 6 and 18 percent, respectively (P less than 0.05). We concluded that a single dose of intravenous Timentin was as effective as two doses for prophylaxis against surgical infection and that the surgeon group and the hospital in which the operation took place were statistically significant predictors of postoperative wound infection. 
5	Balloon angioplasty of stenosed Blalock-Taussig anastomosis: role of balloon-on-a-wire in dilating occluded shunts. Six children with cyanotic congenital heart defects, aged 6 to 60 months, underwent percutaneous balloon angioplasty of a narrowed Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt to improve arterial oxygen saturation. The indication for angioplasty was a cyanotic heart defect not amenable to total surgical correction, either because of the age and size at presentation or because of anatomic complexity, but at the same time requiring palliation of pulmonary oligemia. Following balloon angioplasty, there was an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 71 +/- 8% to 81 +/- 6% (p less than 0.05). In one child with long segment narrowing, there was no significant improvement in oxygen saturation, and this child underwent an additional BT shunt on the contralateral side. On follow-up 3 to 12 months after balloon angioplasty, the oxygen saturations remained improved (78 +/- 10%) in the remaining five patients. In two children with either complete or almost complete blockage of the BT shunt, we were unable to advance any catheter across the shunt but we were able to advance a 2 or 3 mm balloon on a wire and dilate the shunt, followed by introduction of a catheter carrying a larger balloon for angioplasty. This has permitted us to obtain the pulmonary artery pressure directly (this information was of obvious value in patient management) and resulted in an improvement in the arterial oxygen saturation. It is concluded that (1) balloon angioplasty of narrowed BT shunts is feasible, effective, and safe and (2) even completely occluded shunts can be cannulated and the balloon dilated with the newly available balloon-on-wire devices. 
5	Non-vesicular release of glutamate from glial cells by reversed electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glutamate uptake into nerve and glial cells usually functions to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low in the central nervous system. But one component of glutamate release from neurons is calcium-independent, suggesting a non-vesicular release that may be due to a reversal of glutamate uptake. The activity of the electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier can be monitored by measuring the membrane current it produces, and uptake is activated by intracellular potassium ions. Here we report that raising the potassium concentration around glial cells evokes an outward current component produced by reversed glutamate uptake. This current is activated by intracellular glutamate and sodium, inhibited by extracellular glutamate and sodium, and increased by membrane depolarization. These results demonstrate a non-vesicular mechanism for the release of glutamate from glial cells and neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the neurotoxic rise in extracellular glutamate concentration during brain anoxia. 
2	Schatzki's ring: long-term results following dilation The purpose of this study is to report long-term results of 61 patients with Schatzki's ring who were dilated for relief of dysphagia. The severity of Schatzki's ring was mild in 28 patients (46%), moderate in 26 (43%), severe in 5 (8%), and indeterminate in 2 (3%). Follow-up information was available in 56 of 61 patients (mean, 75 months). During follow-up, 35 patients (63%) developed recurrent dysphagia and required repeated dilations: 19 patients (34%) had one to two dilations, 9 patients (16%) had three to seven dilations, 6 patients (11%) had more than seven dilations; 1 patient underwent surgery for resection of the Schatzki's ring (2%). The mean (range) dilation-free interval was 50.1 months (11.8 to 100 months) in mild cases, 44.5 months (8.9 to 82 months) in moderate cases, and 28.6 months (9 to 76 months) in severe cases. There was no significant correlation between the severity of Schatzki's ring on initial presentation and the subsequent dilation-free interval. Our data indicate that recurrent dysphagia is common among patients with Schatzki's ring after a successful dilation, and that the severity of Schatzki's ring is not a good prognostic indicator of the need for subsequent dilation. 
5	Isometric features of orthostatic tremor: an electromyographic analysis. A patient is described with "orthostatic" tremor. Electromyography revealed tremor bursts of 15 Hz in the lower extremities while standing and with isometric activation of the muscles, but the bursts disappeared with isotonic activation of muscles. Similar tremor was recorded in the arms with isometric, but not isotonic activation. Review of previously reported cases confirms these findings. The clinical and electrophysiologic features of this tremor distinguish it from other recognized forms of tremor. 
2	Pancreatic function in Crohn's disease. We investigated exocrine pancreatic function in a population of patients with Crohn's disease in order to correlate the pancreatic function with clinical and laboratory variables. A total of 143 patients affected by Crohn's disease and 115 control subjects were studied. All had a Lundh meal test. As a group patients with Crohn's disease had significantly decreased activity of both amylase (p less than 0.02) and lipase (p less than 0.001) in duodenal aspirates. In patients with Crohn's disease enzyme activities were not correlated to duration of disease or to extent or localisation of previous bowel resection. The lowest enzyme values were found in patients with the most extensive bowel involvement, and they were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than in patients with disease confined to the terminal ileum. The differences between enzyme values in other subgroups of patients were not significant. For the patient group as a whole no correlation was found between disease activity and enzyme values, but for the most uniform group of patients, those with terminal ileitis, pancreatic function was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with moderate and severe disease compared with patients with mild disease. Thus at least two factors seem to be responsible for impaired pancreatic function in Crohn's disease: firstly disease activity and secondly localisation or extent of disease. 
1	Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis--correlation in invasive breast carcinoma. BACKGROUND. Experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. To investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without). METHODS. Using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor VIII. The microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable. RESULTS. Both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. The mean (+/- SD) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. The corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (P = 0.003 and P less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). For each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; P = 0.003). The microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. For each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS. The number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). Assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy.
