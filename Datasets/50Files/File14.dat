2	Liver pathology in morbidly obese patients with and without diabetes. The contribution of obesity and/or diabetes to liver pathology in the morbidly obese patient is controversial. We studied the liver biopsies of 100 consecutive patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity. Multiple morphologic parameters were analyzed and graded independently, without knowledge of the clinical history, liver function tests, and oral glucose tolerance results of the patients. Six percent of the entire group demonstrated no fat, 42% mild fat, 20% moderate fat, and 24% severe fatty metamorphosis of the liver. Twenty-three percent of the patients had central vein fibrosis, 23% sinusoidal fibrosis, 19% bridging fibrosis, and 4% cirrhosis. Thirty-six percent of the patients had some degree of steatohepatitis, 66% possessed so-called glycogen nuclei of hepatocytes, 6% had PAS-positive thickening of blood vessels in the portal tracts, and 1% had lipogranulomas. The degree of fatty metamorphosis and fibrosis was analyzed in three separate groups, categorized by the glycemic status of the patient: 46 patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 23 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 31 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Increasing severity of fatty metamorphosis from the normoglycemic obese to the diabetic obese patients was found, which was statistically significant by chi 2 analysis. Four of the six patients showing no fatty metamorphosis were normoglycemic. Glycogen nuclei and PAS-positive blood vessels were significantly more prevalent in the diabetic obese than in the normal obese. In conclusion, the distribution of significant liver histopathology in the morbidly obese patient correlates in severity with the degree of impaired glycemic status. 
5	Effect of indecainide in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Indecainide, a new antiarrhythmic agent classified as type Ic was evaluated in 11 patients with heart disease who had greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes/hour, moderate-to-marked left ventricular dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction 34% +/- 8%. Patients received indecainide, 50 mg by mouth, every 6 hours and the dose was increased until greater than or equal to 80% suppression was noted, adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 100 mg indecainide was given every 6 hours. Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed greater than or equal to 80% in nine patients (p less than 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia episodes were completely suppressed in five of eight patients. The effective or maximal mean daily indecainide dose was 191 +/- 32 mg; half of the responders achieved achieved efficacy at serum drug concentration greater than or equal to 600 ng/ml. Serum drug concentration was directly related to gender (r = 0.78, p less than 0.04) and inversely related to creatinine clearance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02). Indecainide prolonged mean PR and QRS intervals (p less than 0.05) but not QT or QTc. There was a linear relation between percent change in PR (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and QRS (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) intervals and serum drug concentration. After starting or increasing the dose, careful observation of patients with decreased renal function or reduced ejection fraction should be exercised because they attain higher drug concentration than normal subjects. 
5	In vivo incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate into a rat metastatic brain-tumor model. Lipid metabolism of an intracerebrally implanted brain tumor and normal brain was investigated in awake Fischer 344 rats using intravenously injected [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate as a probe. A suspension of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells (250 cells in 5 microliters medium), with or without 1% low-melting-point agar, was implanted into the caudate nucleus of rats 8 to 9 weeks old. Control animals received an intracerebral injection without tumor cells. Seven days after implantation, awake rats were infused intravenously for 5 minutes with [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate (6.4 mCi/kg). The rats were killed 20 minutes after initiation of the infusion and coronal brain slices were obtained for quantitative autoradiography and light histological study. Tumor cell masses were histologically well demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue. Tumor tissue incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate was heterogeneous, ranging on average from 3.1- to 6.1-fold greater than in the corresponding contralateral brain. In addition, incorporation corresponded to regional tumor cell density. The incorporation rate constant of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate in tumor was significantly increased compared to control brain and was independent of tumor size. Necrotic areas within tumors showed no incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate. Brain surrounding the tumors and control injection sites showed reactive gliosis, and possessed 30% greater incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate than contralateral normal brain. These results suggest that [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate can be used to image brain tumors in vivo, measuring turnover and/or synthesis of tumor and brain lipid. 
2	Incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis in the upper Galilee, Northern Israel, 1967-1986. An epidemiological study of ulcerative colitis was performed in the Upper Galilee, Israel, over a 20-yr period (1967-1986). The average annual incidence of ulcerative colitis was 2.23 per 100,000 population, and the prevalence on December 31, 1986, was 44.58 per 100,000. Considering the fact that strict steps were taken to include only definite cases, these figures are probably an underestimation. An increase of the average annual incidence from 0.88 in the period 1967-1976 to 3.79 in 1977-1986 was found. When the data were stratified according to ethnic groups, the highest average annual incidence and the highest point prevalence was found in Israeli-born Jews (6.9 and 138.2 per 100,000 population, respectively). When Jewish residence patterns were compared, the highest average annual incidence and point prevalence were found among Kibbutz members (5.52 and 110.39, respectively), and the lowest (1.94 and 38.76) among Moshav inhabitants. There were 10 Arab patients with an average annual incidence of 0.96 and a point prevalence of 19.27. There were 25 women and 28 men (female:male ratio of 0.89). Among the Jews, the female:male ratio was 1.04. Peak incidence was found in the 25- to 34-yr-old range. No second peak was noticed. Anemia was demonstrated in 66.6% of the women and 27.5% of the men in our study. We suggest that the increase in UC incidence and prevalence in Israeli and Asia/africa-born Jew and in Arabs in the Upper Galilee points toward environmental factors in the etiology of this disease. 
3	Middle cerebral artery strokes causing homonymous hemianopia: positron emission tomography. Eight patients were evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography between 3 and 30 days after isolated stroke involving the middle cerebral artery territory that caused homonymous hemianopia. Diffuse hypometabolism was present throughout the damaged cerebral hemisphere, even in cortical areas not obviously ischemic by clinical examination or neuro-imaging. Glucose metabolism in primary and association visual cortex of the damaged hemisphere was decreased by more than 47% (p less than 0.01). Metabolism in the undamaged hemisphere was less profoundly affected, but significant decrements were found in calcarine (40%; p less than 0.01) and lateral occipital cortex (35%; p less than 0.05). 
5	Prognostic significance of serosal invasion in carcinoma of the stomach. Two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach invading the serosa were studied with regard to the relationship between the length of the serosal invasion (LSI) and prognosis, with a division made between expanding and infiltrative types of tumors. Among patients with expanding types of tumors, five year survival rates were 40 per cent in patients with LSI less than 4.0 centimeters, 33 per cent in patients with LSI 4.1 to 6.0 centimeters and 13.0 per cent in patients with LSI more than 6.0 centimeters. Among those patients with infiltrative types of tumors, those with less than 2.0 centimeters of LSI had a better prognosis (five year survival rate of 53 per cent), whereas those patients with a LSI more than 2.0 centimeters had a very poor prognosis (five year survival rate of less than 20 per cent) and the significant LSI on prognosis was found to be 2.0 centimeters. Involvement of the lymph node and metastasis to the liver were not affected by LSI, whereas the rates of peritoneal dissemination and direct invasion to neighboring organs increased with an increase in LSI. Knowledge of these factors facilitates the planning of postoperative treatment. 
2	The Munich Gallbladder Lithotripsy Study. Results of the first 5 years with 711 patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term results of three types of shock wave treatment in patients with radiolucent gallbladder stones. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Single-center trial. PATIENTS: Of 5824 patients with gallstones, 19% were eligible; 711 patients were treated. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy as well as adjuvant therapy with bile acids. RESULTS: Lithotripsy was done in three ways, using a water-tank lithotriptor (group A), a water-cushion lithotriptor at low energy levels (group B), and a water-cushion lithotriptor at high energy levels (group C). The rate of complete fragment clearance 9 to 12 months after lithotripsy was done differed significantly among the three groups: Among patients with single stones of 20 mm or less in diameter, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 76%; for group B, it was 60%; and for group C, it was 83% (P = 0.03). Among patients with single stones of 21 to 30 mm, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 63%; for group B, it was 32%; and for group C, it was 58% (P less than 0.005). Among patients with two or three stones, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 38%; for group B, it was 16%; and for group C, it was 46% (P = 0.01). Patients with fragments of 3 mm or less 24 hours after lithotripsy was done showed a higher probability of fragment disappearance than did those with larger fragments (P less than 0.001). The clearance rate was higher in patients who were compliant than in those who were noncompliant with bile acid therapy (P less than 0.001). Adverse effects included liver hematoma in 1 patients, biliary pain attacks in 253 patients (36%), mild biliary pancreatitis in 13 patients (2%), and cholestasis in 7 patients (1%). Elective cholecystectomy was done in 16 patients (2%), and endoscopic sphincterotomy was done in 4 patients (1%). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of complete disappearance of stones after shock wave therapy depends on the size and the number of the initial stones, the diameter of the largest fragment, and the mode of shock wave treatment. Adjuvant therapy with bile acids appears to be important for complete fragment clearance. 
1	A randomized trial comparing two methods of cold knife conization with laser conization. In a randomized study, 62 women were submitted to cold knife conization with application of Sturmdorf sutures, 60 to cold knife conization without sutures, and 61 to laser conization. Early hemorrhage occurred in 1.6, 13.3, and 6.6% of women, respectively (P less than .05), and late hemorrhage in 15.3, 3.6, and 11.7%, respectively. Considering early and late hemorrhage together, there was no significant difference among the three treatment groups. Dysmenorrhea tended to be more common after application of Sturmdorf sutures, as it was reported by 27.8, 13.2, and 14.3% of patients, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. Dysmenorrhea occurred in 13% of the cases with a cone height of 20 mm or less and in 26% of the cases with a cone height greater than 20 mm (P less than .05). Endocervical cells were present significantly more often after sampling with a cytobrush than with a cotton swab (P less than .0001), whereas the method of conization had no influence. In smears obtained with a cytobrush, endocervical cells were present in 88.0, 84.9, and 82.5% of the cases; in smears obtained with a cotton swab, endocervical cells were present in 46.6, 57.7, and 54.5%, respectively. We conclude that cold knife conization without Sturmdorf sutures is about equal to laser conization in overall complications, but the laser is preferable for outpatient treatment because of a lower frequency of early hemorrhage. Sturmdorf sutures should be avoided. Smears at follow-up should be taken with a cytobrush and a wooden spatula. 
4	Left ventricular passive diastolic properties in chronic mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. In chronic mitral regurgitation, the myocardium responds to the increased filling volume by geometric alteration and eccentric hypertrophy. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a pure volume overload on left ventricular diastolic chamber and myocardial properties and to assess the relation of passive diastolic function to systolic ejection performance. METHODS AND RESULTS. By use of simultaneous cineangiography and left ventricular micromanometry, left ventricular passive diastolic stiffness was evaluated in nine normal controls (group 1), 14 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 57%, group 2), and 13 patients with mitral regurgitation and a reduced ejection fraction (less than 57%, group 3). Passive diastolic function was evaluated by using a three-constant elastic model. Left ventricular chamber properties were represented by the relation of pressure to volume; myocardial properties were evaluated by relating myocardial midwall stress to midwall strain. The constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness was decreased in group 2 compared with controls (p less than 0.05) but it was normal in group 3. The constant of myocardial stiffness was increased in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01). Among patients with mitral regurgitation, there was a significant inverse relation between ejection fraction and the constant of myocardial stiffness (r = -0.83). CONCLUSIONS. The chronic adaptation to volume overload in chronic mitral regurgitation tends to decrease left ventricular chamber stiffness. Patients with mitral regurgitation and a depressed ejection fraction demonstrated diastolic myocardial dysfunction. Compromised diastolic function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and reduced systolic performance may contribute to the clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. 
5	Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome. We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage. Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia. None had hemimegalencephaly. We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients. 
1	Keratin subsets in spindle cell sarcomas. Keratins are widespread but synovial sarcoma contains a distinctive keratin polypeptide pattern and desmoplakins. The presence of individual keratin polypeptides and desmoplakins was immunohistochemically studied in 25 spindle cell sarcomas of different types using acetone-fixed frozen sections. Results revealed that keratins 8 and 18 were present in a high number of tumors: 9 of 9 synovial sarcomas, 5 of 7 leiomyosarcomas, 5 of 5 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 4 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. In addition to keratins 8 and 18, the glandular component of synovial sarcoma showed prominent reactivity with antibodies to keratins 7 and 19. Also the glandular epithelial cells in synovial sarcoma showed desmoplakin immunoreactivity preferentially in a luminal distribution, but desmoplakin was absent in other spindle cell sarcomas. Furthermore keratin 13 was seen focally in 4 of 9 synovial sarcomas. In contrast, keratins 7, 13, and 19 were practically absent in leiomyosarcomas, malignant schwannomas, and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. The widespread presence of keratins 8 and 18 in various spindle cell sarcomas may reflect aberrant keratin expression in mesenchymal cells, previously described in cultured transformed fibroblasts. The presence of keratins 7 and 19 and desmoplakin is highly associated with morphologically observable epithelial differentiation restricted to synovial sarcoma among spindle cell sarcomas. 
5	Surgical treatment of hydatid disease of the liver. A 20-year experience. The medical records of 135 consecutive patients (74 women and 61 men) who underwent surgery for hydatid liver disease were reviewed. The patients ranged in age from 4 to 81 years. Twenty-seven patients had undergone previous surgery for hydatid liver disease. Cysts were solitary in 100 patients and multiple in 35 patients. Seventeen patients had concomitant extrahepatic disease. Conservative procedures were used in 71 patients (capitonnage in 50 patients and partial pericystectomy in 21 patients). Radical procedures were used in 64 patients (total pericystectomy in 35 patients, subtotal pericystectomy in 16 patients, and wedge or major liver resection in 13 patients). Operative mortality was 2.2% and morbidity rate was 23.7%. Recurrent disease was found in 13 patients at a mean interval of 3 years from the first operation. Better short- and long-term results were obtained with the use of radical procedures. 
2	Albumin absorption and protein secretion by the gallbladder in man and in the pig. To study albumin absorption by the gallbladder in man, an in vitro model was first established in the pig and compared with in vivo function in the same species. Water and electrolyte transport and 125I-albumin absorption and protein secretion in vivo and in vitro were compared. Then similar in vitro studies were performed on human gallbladders obtained at surgery. The in vivo study in the pig was performed without disturbing the gallbladder except to tie a cannula in the cystic duct end. The in vitro model was identical in the pig and human gallbladders. Gallbladders were excised using a technique causing minimal injury and anoxia. They were oxygenated on both mucosal and serosal surfaces in a temperature-controlled environment. Luminal and external bath test solutions consisted of modified Ringers bicarbonate with added glucose; luminal solutions also contained 125I-albumin from different species, depending on the study. Active absorption of sodium and water occurred in both types of studies in the pig but in vivo absorption rates were considerably greater than in vitro rates. Albumin absorption in vivo was substantial; although present in vitro, the absorption of albumin was diminished relatively more than electrolyte transport rates. Protein secretion rates into the gallbladder were similar in vitro and in vivo. The results of studies in the human gallbladders in vitro were similar to the pig, except albumin absorption was greater. Some human gallbladders were obtained from control patients and some from patients with cholesterol gallstones. There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the variables studied; however, the numbers were small and some control gallbladders were not normal gallbladders. 
1	Cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma. We describe eight cases of cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma, a rare tumor previously reported only once under the term cutaneous angiomyolipoma. Clinically, the tumors were acquired, solitary, asymptomatic nodules that were always acral in location. Patients' ages ranged from 33 to 77 years (median 52.6 years); the male/female ratio was 7:1. Signs of tuberous sclerosis or renal angiomyolipoma were absent in all cases. Histologically, the tumors were subcutaneous, well circumscribed, and composed of smooth muscle, vascular spaces, connective tissue, and mature fat. In some tumors the fat was the predominant component, and in others smooth muscle predominated. Elastic tissue stains revealed that some blood vessels had developed an elastic lamina whereas other blood vessels lacked it. Additional histologic features occasionally observed included vascular thrombi, glomus bodies, and focal mucin deposition. 
2	Regulation of insulin-like growth factor II gene expression by hepatitis B virus in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study we investigated the regulation of insulin-like growth factor II gene expression to explain a role for this growth factor in concert with hepatitis B virus involvement in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis. Sections of normal liver and tumor and non-tumor-bearing liver disease tissue were hybridized in situ with [35S]-labeled insulin-like growth factor II oligonucleotide probe. Parallel sections were tested for presence of insulin-like growth factor II polypeptide using immunohistochemistry. To investigate a possible role for hepatitis B virus in insulin-like growth factor II gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, results were analyzed against patient seropositivity for hepatitis B virus. Levels of insulin-like growth factor II transcripts in normal liver (n = 4) sections and in those from non-tumor-bearing individuals (n = 10) were so low that specific signal was not detectable above homogeneous tissue background. In contrast, 4 of 8 (50%) of the sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhosis or noncirrhotic chronic liver disease with hepatitis B virus involvement showed increased expression of insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts. Up-regulation was observed in cell foci in the hepatocellular regions of the surrounding cirrhotic lobular cells and the fibrous septa. Numerous cell foci were observed in patch distribution in the tumor areas. The level of insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts in sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhotic and noncirrhotic tissues obtained from patients seronegative for hepatitis B virus was similar to that of normal liver. 
5	The mouse insulin-like growth factor type-2 receptor is imprinted and closely linked to the Tme locus. T-associated maternal effect (Tme) is the only known maternal-effect mutation in the mouse. The defect is nuclear-encoded and embryos that inherit a deletion of the Tme locus from their mother die at day 15 of gestation. There are many genomically imprinted regions known in the mouse genome but so far no imprinted genes have been cloned. The Tme locus is absent in two chromosome-17 deletion mutants, Thp and the tLub2, and its position has been localized using these deletions to a 1-cM region. We report here that the genes for insulin-like growth factor type-2 receptor (Igf2r) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase-2 (Sod-2) are absent from both deletions. Probes for these genes and for plasminogen (Plg) and T-complex peptide 1 (Tcp-1) were used in pulsed-field gel mapping to show that Tme must lie within a region of 800-1,100 kb. We also demonstrate that embryos express Igf2r only from the maternal chromosome, and that Tcp-1, Plg and Sod-2 are expressed from both chromosomes. Therefore Igf2r is imprinted and closely linked or identical to Tme. 
5	Progressive coronary luminal narrowing after cardiac transplantation. Accelerated coronary disease is a major factor limiting long-term survival in cardiac transplant recipients. Coronary angiography was obtained a mean of 5.1 weeks posttransplantation and annually thereafter. Replicate projections recorded after nitroglycerine administration were quantitated using computer-assisted edge detection. Five hundred and fifteen coronary segments in 25 patients having 1-year follow-up and 353 segments in 18 patients reaching 2-year follow-up were compared with baseline angiograms. Significant change was defined as +/- 0.10 mm, equal to 3.8% change in diameter based on three standard deviations obtained from estimation of measurement error. Mean coronary diameter fell from 2.44 +/- 0.26 mm at baseline to 2.21 +/- 0.34 mm (p less than 0.001) at 1-year follow-up. This rate of diameter decline was 20-fold more rapid during the initial posttransplantation year than the rate of change of visually normal segments in nontransplant patients with coronary atherosclerosis elsewhere. There was no significant drop in mean diameter between the first and second year in those patients who had second-year studies. Decrease in absolute diameter for vessels greater than 2.9 mm significantly exceeded diameter reduction for smaller vessels but did not differ when considered as a ratio of vessel diameter. In 21 of 25 patients, mean coronary diameter reduction exceeded the three-standard deviation threshold at their last angiogram, but only two of these patients had visually detectable transplant coronary disease. 
3	Cervical spine diastematomyelia in adulthood. Adult cervical diastematomyelia is a rare malformation and is usually associated with posterior element anomalies. A case of isolated cervical diastematomyelia, which was initially thought to be a herniated cervical disc, is described. Diagnosis and surgical management are discussed. 
3	Retrograde transurethral balloon dilation of prostate: innovative management of abacterial chronic prostatitis and prostatodynia. Retrograde transurethral balloon dilatation (RTBD) of the prostate recently has been suggested as alternative therapy for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Seven patients with documented functional urinary outlet obstruction at the level of the bladder neck or prostatic urethra underwent RTBD of prostate. Each patient had a classic diagnosis of abacterial chronic prostatitis or prostatodynia based on history, physical examination, and localization cultures. Prior to RTBD of prostate, patients underwent cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram, urodynamic and uroflow studies. RTBD of prostate was done as an outpatient procedure requiring intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. Dilation was performed with a 25-mm urethroplasty balloon catheter inflated at 3.5 atm of pressure for twenty minutes. Improvement in voiding symptomatology was noted in all patients and graded numerically (0-10 scale), with ten indicating normal voiding. Follow-up to date ranges from one to five months. This technique may have promise as a treatment option in patients with abacterial chronic prostatitis and prostatodynia. 
5	Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Relation to Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and gastric acid secretion. Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. 
5	Percutaneous transvesical chorionic villus sampling: an alternative approach to the retroverted uterus. In 458 consecutive chorionic villus sampling (CVS) procedures, we observed a significant influence of uterine position upon sampling efficacy. Compared with anteverted (N = 243) or axial (N = 149) locations, the retroverted uterus (N = 66) was associated with a lower mean sample weight per aspiration (22, 18, and 15 mg, respectively; P less than .01) and a greater frequency of multiple-pass procedures (23, 31, and 52%, respectively; P less than .0001). To improve sampling efficiency in selected cases of uterine retroversion, we adopted a transvesical approach. When compared with transabdominal or transcervical techniques, transvesical CVS had the highest single-pass success rate (33, 33, and 60%, respectively). Only one in 30 transvesical cases required three placental passes, compared with nine of 36 retroverted uteri sampled by either transabdominal or transcervical techniques (P less than .05). The mean transvesical sample weight was 18.7 mg; at least 10 mg was retrieved in all cases. Post-procedure bleeding occurred in four instances and an additional patient suffered a spontaneous loss at 16 weeks' gestation. Aneuploidy was found in four of 30 biopsy specimens, and the remaining pregnancies either have delivered at term (N = 18) or are continuing (N = 7). Our preliminary experience suggests that selected use of this CVS method may improve sampling efficiency without increasing the incidence of complications. 
5	New insights into the causes of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biologic analysis have led to major new insights concerning the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. This article examines the current state of our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis. The nature of the genetic lesions found in some cancer-causing genes, cancer-inhibiting genes, growth factor genes, and metastasis genes is discussed, as is the impact that these may have on clinical oncology. 
5	Three-dimensional analysis of 61 human endolymphatic ducts and sacs in ears with and without Meniere's disease. We used light microscopy and computerized graphic reconstruction techniques to examine the endolymphatic duct and sac in 20 pairs of bones from patients with Meniere's disease and 21 bones from controls. The diameters of the endolymphatic duct and the proximal portion of the vestibular aqueduct were significantly smaller in Meniere's disease ears than in controls. Graphic reconstructions showed the Meniere's sacs to be smaller and to have fewer tubular epithelial structures in the intraosseous portion than in the control ears. The median volume of the sac in the Meniere's disease side was substantially lower than in the contralateral ear. The width of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was significantly smaller in Meniere's disease ears than in controls. These findings indicate that the size not only of the vestibular aqueduct but also of the sac is reduced in Meniere's disease. The results may suggest that the endolymphatic sac is pathologically changed in Meniere's disease and that a reduced resorptive capacity of a small endolymphatic sac could result in endolymphatic hydrops. 
1	Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. 
4	Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium: report of a successful resection with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection. These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression. The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus. A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence. We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully. The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation. 
2	Small intestinal transit in the portal hypertensive rat. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of portal hypertension on gastrointestinal transit. Portal hypertension was induced in a group of 15 rats by the staged portal vein ligation technique. A control group of 15 rats underwent a sham operation. Ten days later, a 51Cr-labeled Krebs' buffer solution was instilled into the duodenum and the distribution or radioactivity along the length of the small intestine was determined after 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Portal hypertension was consistently established in the study group; splenic pulp pressure (mm Hg, mean +/- SD, portal hypertensive vs. control) was 20.0 +/- 3.9 vs. 12.7 +/- 3.9, P less than 0.002. Various measures of intestinal transit revealed delayed transit in the portal hypertensive group. Retention of radioactivity in the most proximal quartile of the intestine was greater [percentage retained (portal hypertensive vs. control) was 57.9 +/- 17.3 vs. 31.2 +/- 15.3, P less than 0.02, 49.1 +/- 15.5 vs. 28.3 +/- 4.8, P = 0.03, and 42.4 +/- 17.6 vs. 29.0 +/- 8.8, P = 0.08, at 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively] and the geometric mean of transit was located more proximally (P less than 0.02) at each study interval in the portal hypertension group. It was concluded that portal hypertension is associated with delayed intestinal transit. This abnormality could predispose to bacterial overgrowth and contribute to altered digestion and absorption. 
1	Intracranial chordoma in a preadolescent. Case report. Chordomas are rare tumors derived from notochord remnants occurring primarily in the sacrum, clivus, and cervical regions. Exceptionally, these tumors occur in children, though usually in the sacrum. Eight cases of clivus chordoma have been described in preteenagers. In this report, a clival chordoma with unusual radiologic features is described in an 11-year-old boy. The literature regarding this entity is reviewed. 
5	Correlation between laboratory findings and clinical outcome after restorative proctocolectomy: serial studies in 20 patients with end-to-end pouch-anal anastomosis. Clinical function and anorectal physiological function were assessed and correlated in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis before restorative proctocolectomy and 3, 7, and 12 months after operation. The entire anal sphincter was preserved by means of a stapled pouch-anal anastomosis. Before operation, the median resting anal pressure was 79 cmH2O (interquartile range 70-89 cmH2O), the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was present in all patients and anorectal 'sampling' was noted in 16 of 20 patients. Three months after operation, resting anal pressure was 68 cmH2O (range 50-87 cmH2O) (P less than 0.001), the reflex was present in only three patients (P less than 0.001) and sampling was observed in one patient. After 7 months, resting anal pressure was 76 cmH2O (range 64-89 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 11 patients and sampling was observed in nine patients. At 12 months, resting anal pressure was 84 cmH2O (range 66-94 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 19 patients and sampling was observed in 17 patients. The compliance and capacity of the reservoir increased significantly. Ability to discriminate flatus from faeces was associated with return of the rectoanal reflex and sampling. 
3	Stroke rehabilitation: a geropsychological perspective. Rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine are similar in their concern for functional improvement in the face of chronic medical conditions. Although many patients served by rehabilitation medicine fall within the geriatric age range, a knowledge of normal aging does not necessarily inform clinical decision making or research practices in rehabilitation. Using stroke as an example of a disorder affecting primarily geriatric patients and requiring the technology of rehabilitation, ways in which age might affect assessment of outcome are examined. Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted. The final section outlines recommendations for research on rehabilitation outcome of geriatric stroke patients. 
2	A case of severe pancytopenia caused by ibuprofen. We here present the case of a patient with severe neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia associated with long-term use of ibuprofen. The blood parameters rapidly normalized when the drug was discontinued, and no further treatment, except for a short course of antibiotics, was required. 
4	Arterial revascularization by laser angioplasty: first Italian experiences. Eighty-seven laser angioplasty procedures were performed on 85 patients (73 men and 12 women). In the first phase (54 patients) a broad selection process included long occlusions (23.9 cm avg) and vessels with heavy calcification; in the second phase (31 patients) the authors treated vessels with shorter occlusions (10 cm avg) and less calcific. The primary success rate, based on number of procedures (73.5% overall) was 69% in the first phase but reached 81.3% in the second phase. There were 14 perforations (16%), 8 dissections (9.4%), and 4 peripheral emboli (4.7%). Six-month follow-up shows that the Winsor index maintained its initial improvement in 76.5% of all patients, or 62% in just the long occlusions. These data and a review of the cases suggest that no more of 10-20% of patients with claudication in lower extremities can be treated by laser angioplasty; the authors consider ideal candidates those patients who noncalcific lesions in the common iliac or superficial femoral arteries at the III medium level with obstructions shorter than 8 cm and good runoff. 
4	Ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis associated with sensorineural deafness Sensorineural deafness is rarely associated with both ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis. A patient is described in whom acute sensorineural deafness occurred in association with episcleritis, ulcerative colitis and clinical features suggesting giant cell arteritis. 
1	An unusual organoid tumor. Alveolar soft part sarcoma or paraganglioma? The histogenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a subject of continued debate. Although many recent reports suggest a muscle origin, others advocate a neuroendocrine derivation. A tumor in the chest wall of a 16-year-old woman was diagnosed and treated as ASPS. The light microscopic, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings showed features of both ASPS and paraganglioma. In addition, this lesion was positive for antibody to glucagon, a characteristic of neither ASPS nor paraganglioma, although seen in a few gangliocytic paragangliomas. This case demonstrates the need for continued inquiry into the histogenesis of ASPS. 
3	Genetic cause of a juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease in a Lebanese child. Abnormality in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene underlying the clinical phenotype of a Lebanese patient with a juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease has been studied. Clinical features were progressive spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive decline. The protein coding sequence of several beta-hexosaminidase alpha-chain complementary DNAs isolated by polymerase chain reaction was completely normal except for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 1511 within exon 13, which resulted in substitution of the normal arginine 504 (CGC) with histidine (CAC). Although the patient was from a first-cousin marriage, she was heterozygous for this mutation. The abnormality in the other allele, which is carried by the father, was not identified, except that it is neither of the two mutations responsible for the infantile Jewish Tay-Sachs disease. Biosynthetic and immunoprecipitation studies in cultured fibroblasts showed synthesis of the alpha-chain precursor, but the mature form of the alpha-subunit was not detected. 
4	Morphological observations late (greater than 30 days) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty. This report describes clinical, morphological, and histological findings late (1.6-24.1 months [average, 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 necropsied patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 (70%) of patients, including six patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had cardiac causes of death and six (30%) had noncardiac causes of death. Two major subgroups of histological findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%) and 2) atherosclerotic plaques only. Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaques only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphological evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, or tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaques only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphological findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for coronary artery balloon angioplasty restenosis are proposed. 
2	Prognosis of Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis. Twenty of 320 patients with Wilson's disease initially presented with chemical and laboratory features of chronic active hepatitis, confirmed histologically in 17. When first seen, cirrhosis was present in all 20 and was complicated by ascites and/or jaundice in 11. Within 1 week to 8 years of the onset of over liver disease the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established, and treatment with D-penicillamine was promptly initiated in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and virtually normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in the majority of subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who became noncompliant with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplants. These results indicate that the prognosis of specifically treated Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis is very good in spite of the presence of cirrhosis. 
3	Limited selective posterior rhizotomy for the treatment of spasticity secondary to infantile cerebral palsy: a preliminary report. A limited selective posterior rhizotomy was performed on 30 children suffering from spasticity secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. As opposed to standard techniques that stimulate and divide the dorsal rootlets from L2 to S1, we dissected L4, L5, and S1 dorsal roots through an L5 to S1 laminectomy. Eight to 12 rootlets from each root were electrically stimulated with two unipolar electrodes (pulse width, 50 microseconds; 10-50 V). The muscle responses were observed visually and registered by electromyography. Those rootlets associated with an abnormal motor response as evidenced by sustained muscular contraction or by prolonged electromyographic response were divided. Spasticity was scored from 0 to +. The muscular groups assessed were those involved in the flexion of the shoulder, elbow and wrist in the upper limbs, and those involved in flexion and adduction of the hip, flexion of the leg, and plantar flexion in the lower limbs. The patients were assessed 1 week before and 6 months after the operation. Reduction of spasticity was observed in all the muscular groups, and all the patients presented functional improvement of motor abilities. These preliminary results indicate that a limited procedure that reduces the extension of the laminectomy and the length of the operation could be effective for treating spasticity secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. 
5	Reconstruction of mandibular defects in irradiated patients. In this prospective study, mandibular reconstruction using titanium plates was evaluated in 31 patients treated between July 1988 and January 1990. Sixteen patients had prior surgery; 13 had prior radiotherapy. In 11 patients, prior radiation and surgery had failed. Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy either in standard or accelerated fractions. Twelve patients had complications of either intraoral (8), extraoral (5), or combined (1) plate exposure or fistula formation (2). Factors significantly related to complications were poor nutrition, accelerated radiation, and recurrence. Sixty-one percent of all patients healed uneventfully. When patients with complications secondary to recurrence who subsequently died were excluded, the success rate was 73%. Only one patient had an unacceptable result that produced a cosmetic and functional deformity despite secondary repair. 
4	Influence of dietary cod liver oil on fatty acid composition of plasma lipids in human male subjects after myocardial infarction. A randomized crossover study was carried out to investigate the fatty acid profile and concentrations of plasma lipids in male patients with myocardial infarction (MI) who supplemented their diet with 20 ml cod liver oil daily for 6 weeks. Subjects were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received cod liver oil daily for 6 weeks after hospital discharge, but none for the subsequent 6 weeks. Group B did not start taking cod liver oil until 6 weeks after hospital discharge, and they then took cod liver oil for 6 weeks. Diet, medication or smoking habits were kept as constant as possible during the study. During the period of cod liver oil intake, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 (n-3), EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 (n-3), DHA) increased significantly in phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE), whereas linoleic acid (18:2 (n-6), LA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3 (n-6), DHGLA) and arachidonic acid (20:4 (n-6), AA) were significantly decreased in phospholipids. The plasma level of TG was significantly decreased during the cod liver oil intake. Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and levels of apolipoproteins A1 and B were not affected by cod liver oil in these MI patients. 
5	Use of immunoelectron microscopy to show Ebola virus during the 1989 United States epizootic. A filovirus, serologically related to Ebola virus, was detected by "post-embedment" immunoelectron microscopical examination of MA-104 cells. These had been infected by inoculation with serum samples obtained during the 1989 epizootic in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), imported from the Philippines and maintained at Reston, Virginia, USA, a primate holding facility. The immunoelectron microscopy method, when used in conjunction with standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of infected cells, provided consistent results and was simple to perform in this epizootic. It is concluded that immunoelectron microscopy is potentially useful in the direct immunological diagnosis of Ebola and related filoviral infections (such as Marburg) in clinical samples obtained from those with acute infection. 
5	Recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome. Recurrent symptoms develop in 15% to 20% of patients undergoing either first rib resection or scalenectomy for thoracic outlet syndrome. Over the past 22 years 134 operations for recurrence were performed in 97 patients. Four operations were used: transaxillary first rib resection (26); supraclavicular first rib resection with neurolysis (15); scalenectomy with neurolysis (58); and brachial plexus neurolysis (35). Complications included temporary plexus injury (0.7%), temporary phrenic palsy (3.7%), and permanent phrenic palsy (1.4%). The combined primary success rate of all four operations for recurrence was 84% in the first 3 months. This fell to 59% at 1 to 2 years; 50% at 3 to 5 years; and 41% at 10 to 15 years. No significant difference was found in results between the four operations used for recurrence. When recurrence was caused by trauma the results of reoperations were better than when recurrence was spontaneous. The primary success rates of three initial operations for thoracic outlet syndrome were compared to their secondary success rates (improved after reoperation). By use of life-table methods, reoperation improved the 5- to 10-year success rate of transaxillary first rib resection from 69% to 86% and for scalenectomy from 69% to 84%. Reoperation is successful in most cases of recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome and better when recurrence is the result of a neck injury. 
1	Preferential mitogenic activity for myoblast-like cells can be extracted from uterine leiomyoma tissues. The presence of mitogen(s) in leiomyoma extracts stimulating cells with the fibroblast, myoblast, and osteoblast phenotype was documented. Mitogenic activity in leiomyoma extracts was acid stable and sensitive to tryptic digestion. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography successfully separated mitogen(s) with preferential activity for myoblast cells from mitogens with a broad type of cell specificity and from inhibitors. This leiomyoma-derived preferential activity for myoblasts was absent in identically treated myometrial and endometrial extracts. This suggests that leiomyoma-derived substances with preferential growth factor activity for myoblast-like cells may play a role in the pathophysiologic characteristics of uterine leiomyomas. 
5	Congenital cyst of common bile duct: an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice. Congenital cysts, sometimes referred to as nonparasitic biliary cysts, are not unusual findings in the liver parenchyma, but they have not been previously described in the common bile duct. This clinical report describes a 41-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice that was caused by congenital cysts. The patient had obstruction of the middle portion of the common bile duct; therefore the major differential diagnostic considerations were cholangiocarcinoma, cancer of the pancreas, or true biliary cysts. Congenital cysts, retention cysts, and neoplastic cysts cannot be differentiated from other true cysts preoperatively. Diagnosis can only be established by microscopic examination after surgical excision. 
4	Surgical correction of recurrent venous ulcer. Seventy-six limbs from 46 patients with comparable superficial and deep venous valve incompetence underwent surgical correction for recurrent venous ulcers of the leg that were refractory to various modes of nonsurgical and surgical treatments. A follow-up of 10 to 73 months (mean = 37 months), revealed the venous ulcer healed with perforator ligation and saphenous vein stripping in 14 of 33 (44%), stripping plus valvuloplasty 17 of 21 (80%), stripping plus vein transposition 11 of 14 (78%) and stripping plus valve transplantation 6 of 8 (75%). In patients with incompetent deep venous valve and perforators, the disassociation of the superficial from the deep venous system (stripping) plus correction of the deep venous valvular incompetence (valvuloplasty, transposition or valve transplant) produced superior results in the treatment of recurrent venous ulcer when compared to perforator ligation and saphenous vein stripping alone (p less than 0.005). Adjunctive usage of elastic stockings and intermittent compression pneumatic boots in the perioperative period was helpful in controlling leg swelling and promoting wound healing. 
5	Chronic anaemia, hyperbaric oxygen and tumour radiosensitivity. Anaemia is an important factor in the response of some human tumours to radiotherapy. The outcome is also influenced by whether the treatment is given in air or high pressure oxygen (HPO). The present study examined the relationship between anaemia and tumour response to radiation given in air or HPO in C3H mice transplanted with a mammary adenocarcinoma using a growth delay assay to assess the radiation response. Chronic anaemia was induced by the use of a low iron diet and was characterized by a significant reduction in host haematocrit and whole blood viscosity. In addition, anaemia was associated with a right shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve and an increase in the volume doubling time of the tumour; but there was no change in the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cells. Radiation studies with these anaemic mice demonstrated that the tumour radiosensitivity was decreased when treatment was given in air. HPO was successful in overcoming the increased radioresistance associated with anaemia. This result suggested that tumours grown in anaemic mice have a higher hypoxic fraction than those grown in control mice. Changes in host physiology with chronic anaemia may contribute to the benefit seen with HPO but such alterations per se may be inadequate to maintain tumour oxygenation when treatment is given in air. 
4	Spontaneous regression of cardiomyopathy in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cardiac involvement is common in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and, when symptomatic, it portends a poor prognosis. We present a case of marked spontaneous regression of cardiomyopathy in a patient with AIDS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous recovery of ventricular function in an AIDS patient. 
4	Relation between beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure. The Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Research Group. This study examined the relations among beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure in patients after myocardial infarction. The study was performed with the placebo group of the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial. Ejection fraction data were available in 1,084 patients; of these, 557 were receiving a beta-blocker and 527 were not. In addition to ejection fraction, other correlates of left ventricular function included the presence or absence of pulmonary rales, chest X-ray film evidence of pulmonary congestion and the presence of an S3 gallop. Beta-blocker use was less frequent in patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, rales, an S3 gallop and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray film. Twenty-one percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, 42% of patients with rales, 28% of patients with an S3 gallop and 28% of patients with pulmonary congestion were receiving beta-blocker therapy. For every correlate of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure was greater in patients with diminished left ventricular function than in those without. For each level of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure requiring treatment was greater in patients not taking a beta-blocker. 
5	Vaginal bleeding in childhood and adolescence. Vaginal bleeding in early childhood, regardless of its duration and quantity, is always of clinical importance. This article discusses the examination of the child and adolescent and reviews the various causes of vaginal bleeding in these patient groups. 
3	Respiratory muscle involvement in nemaline myopathy. A boy who had experienced generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia since early infancy was diagnosed as having nemaline myopathy on the basis of muscle biopsy at 3 years of age. At 8 years of age, he developed severe respiratory failure and required respiratory support during sleep. Because of recurrent pneumothorax, he underwent thoracic surgery, at which time biopsy specimens were obtained from the respiratory and truncal muscles. The histologic findings of the respiratory muscles included marked variation in fiber size with a notable increase in fibrous tissue, type 2 fiber deficiency, elevated acid phosphatase activity, and a disorganized intermyofibrillar network. The findings from the truncal muscles were similar to those of the biceps brachii muscle: little variation in fiber size, numerous nemaline bodies in all fibers, and type 1 fiber predominance. The preferential damage to the respiratory muscles was probably responsible for the sudden onset of severe respiratory failure. 
4	Effects of xamoterol on inotropic and lusitropic properties of the human myocardium and on adenylate cyclase activity. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of xamoterol in the human myocardium. In the presence of forskolin or milrinone, xamoterol increased isometric force of contraction, contraction velocity, and relaxation velocity in isolated, electrically driven preparations from human myocardium, but had no effect alone. There was no difference in the effect of xamoterol between right atrial myocardium and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing (NF), moderately failing (NYHA II-III), and severely failing (NYHA IV) human hearts. The positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoprenaline were reduced depending on the severity of heart failure in left ventricular myocardium (i.e., NF greater than NYHA II-III greater than NYHA IV). In the presence of norepinephrine, xamoterol produced negative inotropic effects similar to those of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and propranolol. Xamoterol alone had no effects on force of contraction, whereas pindolol and propranolol markedly reduced contractile force. In NYHA class IV, isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase about twofold but xamoterol, like pindolol or propranolol, had no effect. Experiments with the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, showed that the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of xamoterol were mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consistently, xamoterol had a selectivity of 13.8 at beta 1-adrenoceptors as measured in radioligand binding experiments. It is concluded that xamoterol acts as a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a selectivity of 13.8 in human ventricular myocardium. The compound has an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as it produces beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the presence of forskolin. The beneficial effects of xamoterol in patients with heart failure could be due to prevention of the detrimental effects of norepinephrine such as beta 1-adrenoceptor downregulation of an increase of Gi (inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding protein). 
4	Effect of abrupt mitral regurgitation after balloon valvuloplasty on myocardial load and performance. The concept that mitral regurgitation masks myocardial dysfunction by reducing afterload and augmenting ejection performance has not been well established in humans. The effect of abruptly produced mitral regurgitation on left ventricular loading and performance was therefore evaluated in five patients who developed this complication after an otherwise successful percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area by Gorlin formula calculated with forward flow increased from 0.92 +/- 0.14 to 2.75 +/- 0.82 cm2. Mean left atrial pressure did not decrease (19 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg). The size of the left atrial V wave relative to mean left atrial pressure (peak V - mean left atrial pressure) increased from 7 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg. Angiographic mitral regurgitation increased from 0+ or 1+ to greater than 3+ in each patient and regurgitant fraction increased from 0.23 +/- 0.11 to 0.55 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.01). End-diastolic volume increased modestly from 148 +/- 15 to 159 +/- 15 ml (p = NS). Heart rate increased from 54 +/- 5 to 71 +/- 8 beats/min (p less than 0.05), which may have prevented further increases in preload by shortening the filling period. End-systolic stress decreased by 32% from 277 +/- 34 to 188 +/- 52 kdyn/cm2 (p less than 0.01) as a result of a 25% decrease in end-systolic pressure from 121 +/- 8 to 91 +/- 7 mm Hg and a 16% decrease in end-systolic volume from 67 +/- 13 to 56 +/- 8 ml (p = NS). 
5	How long can a coronary reperfusion catheter be placed in acute coronary occlusion following failed transluminal coronary angioplasty? A case report. A coronary reperfusion catheter (CRC) is designed to preserve antegrade coronary flow when abrupt coronary closure occurs during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Insertion of the catheter to an occluded coronary artery for a few hours has been reported to be effective for myocardial salvage: however, it is unknown how long the catheter can be kept in place without causing extension of myocardial ischemia. The authors experienced a case in which the CRC was kept in place for twenty-four hours for anticoagulant therapy of an occluded coronary artery following failure of PTCA. This case suggests that adequate anticoagulant therapy can prolong the period during which a CRC can be kept in place if emergency coronary bypass surgery cannot be performed immediately after failure of coronary angioplasty. 
4	Adenine nucleotide changes in kidney, liver, and small intestine during different forms of ischemic injury. The purpose of this study was to better characterize renal adenine nucleotide pool responses to different forms of shock, contrast the changes to those found in other intra-abdominal organs (the liver and small intestine), and assess whether these changes are closely mimicked by those produced by renal arterial occlusion, the usual method used to study ischemic acute renal failure. Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock, septic shock, or cardiopulmonary shock of varying severities and durations. The liver consistently had the greatest energy depletion, followed by the kidney, and then the small intestine. However, only the kidney developed clear morphological damage (S3 brush border sloughing). Kidney adenylate pools were better preserved during septic shock and cardiopulmonary shock than during hemorrhagic shock despite comparable blood pressures. Only profound hemorrhagic shock (35-40 mm Hg for 25 minutes) decreased total adenylate pools (ATP + ADP + AMP). However, the degree of renal catabolite (nucleosides plus purine base) accumulation did not correlate with the amount of renal total adenine nucleotide depletion, partially because circulating catabolites contributed to intrarenal catabolite pools. Purine base/uric acid ratios differed among shocked organs, consistent with different degrees of xanthine oxidase activity (small intestine greater than liver greater than kidney). Renal morphological damage decreased during the immediate (0-30 minutes) postshock period, and the extent of this improvement was not altered by xanthine oxidase inhibition (oxypurinol), suggesting that the immediate postshock period is not one of serious oxidative injury. Shock, in comparison with renal arterial occlusion, caused only modest ATP loss/catabolite accumulation, very low purine base/uric acid ratios, and no immediate-reperfusion (0-30 minutes) resynthesis of the total adenylate pool. Thus, ischemia-induced renal adenylate changes may differ considerably, depending on the nature of the ischemic event. 
5	The role of infections in the rheumatic diseases: molecular mimicry between bacterial and human stress proteins? Infections can cause or exacerbate the rheumatic diseases in several ways, including immune cross-reactivity between bacterial heat shock proteins and similar proteins in normal human tissues. This may lead to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus. In addition, increased activation of the gene regulating the synthesis of a heat shock protein has been found in scleroderma fibroblasts. As an infection-induced model for other rheumatic diseases, rheumatic fever (RF), with its well-established link to prior group A streptococcal infection, will be revisited. The lessons learned from RF and other rheumatic diseases directly linked to infection will be applied to ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and polymyositis, for which a mounting body of circumstantial evidence suggests a probable infectious cause. The interplay of genetic susceptibility and infection with particular organisms and the implications of this new information for present and future therapy of the rheumatic diseases will also be presented. 
2	Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Award lecture. Pathobiology of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The major route of passive permeation across intestinal epithelia is paracellular. The intercellular tight junction lies in and serves as the rate-limiting barrier in this paracellular pathway. Once viewed as static, it is now clear that the structure and permeability of the tight junction is highly dynamic. Not only may inflammatory events (cytokines, neutrophil transmigration) reversibly effect the tight junction but this key barrier also is regulated by physiologic events such as activation of absorptive cell Na(+)-nutrient cotransporters. Such physiologic regulation of the junction is of major importance to the absorption of nutrients via parcellular solvent drag. 
5	Genetics of common diseases of adulthood. Implications for prenatal counseling and diagnosis. Genetic factors play an important role in the development of many common diseases of adulthood that result in early morbidity and mortality. Prevention of these disorders and their sequelae is best established through early detection and early intervention. Although it may be feasible to screen the entire population for some disorders (e.g., hypertension), this approach would be expensive and impractical for others (e.g., colon cancer). The family history provides an inexpensive and convenient method of identifying families at risk for premature diseases of adulthood. Family screening for a disorder should be recommended if there is increased risk for the disorder among family members, if screening methods are available to detect the condition at an early age or preclinical stage, and if early intervention will alter the course of the disease. For many disorders screening and intervention can prevent the occurrence of clinical disease. The prenatal counseling session affords an ideal setting for identifying families at risk for diseases of adulthood with major genetic components. By reviewing the family history, key family members can be identified and investigated, in order to establish a specific genetic diagnosis. At-risk relatives can then be counseled and screened for the disorder preclinically and premorbidly. The screening and intervention available for a disease depends on the nature of the disorder, our understanding of its physiology and etiology, and our current technology. The disorders discussed earlier are typical of conditions of adulthood that are influenced strongly by genetic factors, especially when they appear in younger adults. Atherosclerosis, colon cancer, and diabetes are complex phenotypes. Each can be caused by single-gene defects, but commonly the genetics are more complex. Empiric data help to establish the risk to an individual in the latter cases. In all three examples, early detection should lead to treatment, which can prevent more serious sequelae: by treating the dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease can be prevented; by removing the benign polyp, malignant cancer can be avoided; and when impaired glucose tolerance is detected, diet and exercise can prevent or delay frank diabetes and its complications. The complete evaluation of individuals at risk for disorders such as those in Table 1 and their families can be a complicated task. Referral to a center experienced in the genetics of common diseases often may be necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
2	Urinary excretion of bile acid glucosides and glucuronides in extrahepatic cholestasis. Recently the formation of bile acid glucosides has been described as a novel conjugation mechanism in vitro and in vivo. In 10 patients with extrahepatic cholestasis caused by carcinoma of the head of the pancreas we investigated excretion rates and profiles of urinary bile acid glucosides. Urinary bile acid glucosides and, for comparison, bile acid glucuronides were extracted and characterized according to established methods. In controls total urinary bile acid glucoside excretion was 0.22 +/- 0.03 mumol/24 hr (mean +/- S.E.M.)-in the range of bile acid glucuronide excretion (0.41 +/- 0.06 mumol/24 hr; mean +/- S.E.M.). A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-characterized trihydroxy bile acid glucoside of still-unknown hydroxyl positions accounted for 65% of total urinary bile acid glucosides. In extrahepatic cholestasis total urinary bile acid glucoside excretion was 0.52 +/- 0.13 mumol/24 hr (mean +/- SEM), yet significantly lower than bile acid glucuronide excretion (1.53 +/- 0.13 mumol/24 hr; mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.001). In cholestasis the primary bile acid derivatives cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid glucosides amounted to 90%, whereas the trihydroxy bile acid glucoside had decreased to 5% of total bile acid glucoside excretion, indicating its alteration during enterohepatic circulation. The data establish the composition and quantity of urinary bile acid glucosides in healthy controls and cholestasis and constitute a quantitative comparison with another glycosidic conjugation reaction, bile acid glucuronidation. 
4	Myocardial infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning was not attenuated by oxygen free-radical scavengers in the rabbit. BACKGROUND. The limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning on infarct size has been reported in canine hearts, which contain considerable amounts of xanthine oxidase, a free radical-producing enzyme. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that free radicals generated during preconditioning may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning. The present study examined 1) whether preconditioning limits infarct size in rabbits, which, like humans, lack myocardial xanthine oxidase and 2) whether the cardioprotective effect of PC is mediated by free radicals. METHODS AND RESULTS. A branch of the circumflex coronary artery in rabbits was occluded for 30 minutes and then reperfused for 72 hours. Myocardial infarct size and area at risk were determined by histology and fluorescent particles, respectively. Five groups were studied: an untreated control group, a preconditioned group (PC group), a high-dose superoxide dismutase (SOD)-treated preconditioned group (high-dose SOD-PC group), a low-dose SOD-treated preconditioned group (low-dose SOD-PC group), and a SOD-plus-catalase-treated preconditioned group (SOD/CAT-PC group). Preconditioning was performed with four episodes of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion. The free radical scavengers (30,000 units/kg SOD for high-dose SOD-PC group, 15,000 units/kg SOD for low-dose SOD-PC group, and 30,000 units/kg SOD plus 55,000 units/kg catalase for SOD/CAT-PC group) were infused intravenously over 60 minutes starting 20 minutes before preconditioning. Infarct size as the percentage of area at risk was 45.1 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SEM) in the control group (n = 11), 13.3 +/- 3.0% in the PC group (n = 12), 9.7 +/- 1.8% in the high-dose SOD-PC group (n = 8), 11.9 +/- 2.2% in the low-dose SOD-PC group (n = 6), and 9.6 +/- 2.3% in the SOD/CAT-PC group (n = 6) (p less than 0.05 versus control for the last four values). The differences in infarct size as the percent of area at risk among the PC, high-dose SOD-PC, low-dose SOD-PC, and SOD/CAT-PC groups were not significant. CONCLUSION. Ischemic preconditioning delays ischemic myocardial necrosis regardless of myocardial xanthine oxidase content. Free radicals are unlikely to have a major role in the mechanism of the preconditioning in rabbits. 
3	Isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding an autoantigen recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine. 
5	Transient left ventricular cavitary dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging as an indicator of severe coronary artery disease. Transient left ventricular (LV) cavitary dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging was reported in 45 of 510 (9%) consecutive patients referred for dipyridamole-thallium imaging. Clinical and hemodynamic effects observed during dipyridamole infusion were not predictive of transient cavitary dilation on the thallium images. Coronary angiography was performed in 32 of the 45 patients: 75% had either left main, 3-vessel or "high-risk" 2-vessel coronary artery disease. Although 25 of 45 patients (56%) with transient cavitary dilation were either asymptomatic or had only grade 1/4 effort angina, 16 of 25 patients (64%) not referred for coronary revascularization sustained a cardiac event during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Most events were cardiac deaths (75%) and 87% of events occurred within 4 months of the test. Noncardiac surgery was performed in 187 of the 510 patients. The postoperative cardiac event rate was 2% in the 101 patients with normal scans or fixed defects, 19% in 75 patients with reversible perfusion defects and 58% in 12 patients with reversible cavitary dilation (p less than 0.0001). Thus, transient LV dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a marker of severe underlying coronary artery disease, denotes a poor prognosis and predicts a high risk of postoperative cardiac complications in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery. 
5	The "all-autogenous" tissue policy for infrainguinal reconstruction questioned. In 33% of patients referred for infrainguinal reconstruction for limb-threatening ischemia (mean preoperative ankle-arm index [AAI] = 0.26), no suitable autogenous reconstruction was possible. In 40% of cases, intraoperative pre-bypass contrast arteriography was necessary to identify a graftable tibial or pedal artery. The results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and autogenous bypasses were compared after 1 to 3 years. After 1 year, patency was 85% and 67% for autogenous and PTFE bypasses, respectively. Limb salvage was 90% for autogenous bypass and 70% for PTFE bypass. Cumulative patency rates at 3 years were 80% for autogenous and 57% for PTFE grafts. Graft surveillance with duplex scanning and AAI was valuable in detecting failing grafts. For both types of reconstruction, secondary procedures were required to maintain patency. We attribute the excellent results with PTFE in part to long-term aspirin and warfarin therapy. In cases of combined superficial femoral and severe infra-popliteal occlusive disease, PTFE bypass is an excellent alternative when no autogenous conduit is available. 
4	Natural history of moderate aortic stenosis. The natural history of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has been well documented. However, the natural history of moderate aortic stenosis remains poorly understood. Therefore, a group of 66 patients was identified who had a diagnosis of moderate aortic stenosis at the time of cardiac catheterization (aortic valve area 0.7 to 1.2 cm2) and who did not have surgical therapy during the 1st 180 days after cardiac catheterization. During a mean follow-up period of 35 months, 14 patients died of causes attributed to aortic stenosis and 21 underwent aortic valve replacement. The estimated probability for remaining free of any complication of aortic stenosis at the end of the first 4 years was 59%. Symptomatic patients with decreased ejection fraction or hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular decompensation were at greater risk for these complications. It is concluded that patients with moderate aortic stenosis are at significant risk for the development of complications. 
1	Endosalpingosis as a cause of chronic pelvic pain. Endosalpingosis, a condition characterized by ectopic oviduct epithelium, is diagnosed histologically by the appearance of benign ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells in an abnormal location. Endosalpingosis is typically without symptoms. Our unusual case report shows symptomatic endosalpingosis first seen with chronic pelvic pain. Various aspects of this disease will also be discussed. 
1	Mucocelelike tumor of the breast associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia or mucinous carcinoma. A clinicopathologic study of seven cases. We studied seven patients with mucocelelike tumors of the breast, known to be benign lesions that may be confused with mucinous carcinomas of the breast. All patients had a palpable mass. Microscopically, the most striking feature was the cystic character of the lesion. The epithelial lining of the cysts was usually flat or cuboidal to low columnar, and mucin pools frequently appeared near the ruptured cysts. Three mucocelelike tumors contained a microscopic focus of mucinous carcinoma. The other tumors had areas of atypical ductal hyperplasia containing abundant intraluminal mucinous materials. The mucin was composed predominantly of neutral and nonsulfated acid mucins whose character was identical to that of those in mucinous carcinoma. Because all mucocelelike tumors in our series were associated with either atypical ductal hyperplasia or carcinoma and because some mucocelelike tumors may indeed be early mucinous carcinomas of the breast, we recommend examination of the entire specimen and careful clinical follow-up. 
4	Echocardiographic assessment of doxazosin on left ventricular mass in patients with essential hypertension. A single daily dose of doxazosin taken during a 12-week period produced a significant reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index in patients with mild or moderate hypertension. The systolic shortening coefficient was also increased and a trend in the improvement of ejection fraction, rate of circumferential fiber shortening, systolic contraction time, and preejective/ejective ratio was observed. No change in heart rate was recorded and no patients had side effects. The serum lipid profile was modified favorably, particularly with regard to the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. By producing a reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass while favorably modifying the serum lipid profile, doxazosin produced a beneficial change in the overall coronary heart disease risk profile. 
2	Use of the pudendo-anal reflex in the treatment of neurogenic faecal incontinence. An electrical stimulator has been devised to treat neurogenic faecal incontinence caused by pudendal nerve neuropathy and works on the basis of repeated stimulation of the pudendo-anal reflex arc. Although conduction in the pudendo-anal reflex arc may be prolonged, and is so in neurogenic faecal incontinence, it must be shown to be present before the method can be used. This stimulation results in an immediate rise in the pressure in the anal canal and a significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the external anal sphincter. Maintenance of the stimulus over a two month period raised the mean resting pressure significantly in the anal canal and increased the reflex and voluntary responses of the external anal sphincter to coughing and squeezing actions respectively. The length of the sphincter was not affected. There was widening of the mean motor unit potential duration, though this was not significant. The resting electromyogram was enhanced after the course of treatment, indicating greater spontaneous activity in the external sphincter. The changes led to seven of the eight patients studied becoming continent at the end of the treatment. 
3	Clinical features and natural history of von Hippel-Lindau disease The clinical features, age at onset and survival of 152 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease were studied. Mean age at onset was 26.3 years and 97 per cent of patients had presented by aged 60 years. Retinal angioma was the first manifestation in 65 patients (43 per cent), followed by cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 60, 39 per cent) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 15, 10 per cent). Overall, 89 patients (59 per cent) developed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, 89 (59 per cent) a retinal angioma, 43 (28 per cent) renal cell carcinoma, 20 (13 per cent) spinal haemangioblastoma and 11 (7 per cent) a phaeochromocytoma. Renal, pancreatic and epididymal cysts were frequent findings but their exact incidence was not accurately assessed. Mean age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (44.0 +/- 10.9 years) was significantly older than that for cerebellar haemangioblastoma (29.0 +/- 10.0 years) and retinal angioma (25.4 +/- 12.7 years). The probability of a patient with von Hippel-Lindan disease developing a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, retinal angioma or renal cell carcinoma by age 60 years was 0.84, 0.7 and 0.69, respectively. A comprehensive screening protocol for affected patients and at-risk relatives is presented, based on detailed analysis of age at onset data for each of the major complications. Median actuarial survival was 49 years, with renal cell carcinoma the leading cause of death. 
4	Metabolic considerations in the choice of therapy for the patient with hypertension. The objective of treating patients with hypertension is not simply to reduce blood pressure but rather to prevent the associated morbidity and mortality. Recent assessments of clinical trials have shown that while the risk of stroke is consistently lower with antihypertensive therapy, the same degree of success has not been demonstrated for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although there are many explanations of why we have not done as well in preventing CAD, one possibility is that the therapy used in clinical trials, primarily thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, has increased the patient's risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis or lethal arrhythmias. Four classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended for initial therapy--thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers. The metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics include electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia), dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides), abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance), and hyperuricemia. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers have many of the same metabolic adverse reactions. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) also cause dyslipidemias (lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased triglycerides) and abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance). beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers with ISA and third-generation beta-blockers with selective partial agonist activity (celiprolol and dilevalol) do not cause dyslipidemia and to date do not appear to induce abnormalities in glucose metabolism. ACE inhibitors may decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and captopril may improve insulin sensitivity. Calcium entry blockers are metabolically neutral. 
1	The Cancer Prevention Reminder System. The Cancer Prevention Reminder System is a computer-based system designed to increase the delivery of periodic health maintenance procedures. The program provides printed reminders that identify patients' overdue procedures, prints summary reports of the percentage of patients who are eligible and overdue for a procedure, and prints mailing labels for patients. We performed a randomized, controlled trial in which the effects of computer-based reminders were compared with those of two other interventions among residents in a university-based group practice. 
5	Hyperkalemia in acute glomerulonephritis due to transient hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Transient hyperkalemia has been reported to occur in patients with acute glomerulonephritis, but the pathogenetic mechanism has not been investigated systematically. We studied the mechanism of hyperkalemia (5.7 to 6.7 mmol/liter) in four men with post-infectious glomerulonephritis. All four patients had clinical findings consistent with acute glomerulonephritis (edema, hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and an elevated ASO titer) and a renal biopsy performed in three of the patients confirmed the diagnosis. In comparison to normal subjects (N = 18), plasma aldosterone (5.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 22.8 +/- 2.6 ng/dl, P less than 0.005) and plasma renin activity (0.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml/hr, P less than 0.005) were reduced. Hyperkalemia resolved within one to two weeks in two patients as the nephritis resolved and diuresis ensued, and aldosterone and renin levels obtained at follow-up visits were normal. Hyperkalemia persisted despite furosemide-induced diuresis in the other two patients, but resolved with fludrocortisone treatment. Thus, hyperkalemia in patients with acute glomerulonephritis is a manifestation, in part, of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. It is ameliorated by mineralocorticoid therapy and improves spontaneously with resolution of the glomerulonephritis. 
2	Retained intrahepatic stones: treatment with piezoelectric lithotripsy combined with stone extraction. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed in 11 patients with oriental cholangiohepatitis and intrahepatic stones associated with segmented strictures of intrahepatic ducts. All patients had previously undergone biliary surgery and basket extraction via a T-tube tract at the time of lithotripsy. The indication for ESWL was failure of, or anticipated difficulty with, basket extraction of the stones via a T-tube tract. A piezoelectric lithotriptor was used in all procedures. The average total number of shock waves administered was 29,756 (range, 10,000-61,395). The average number of treatment sessions was 3.1 (range, 1-6); the number of shock waves used in a single session ranged from 10,000 to 15,000 with a frequency of five shots per second and 30%-50% power. In six patients, the stones were successfully fragmented and completely removed; in three of the others of the stones were fragmented and removed. The overall success rate, including complete (54%) and incomplete (27%) success, was 82%. Difficulty in targeting stones, and severe strictures and deformities of intrahepatic ducts, were the factors responsible for failure. No significant complications were observed. 
5	Radiculomegaly of canines and congenital cataracts--a syndrome? Radiculomegaly of single teeth is very uncommon. Our survey indicates that the canine tooth is most frequently affected. Although illustrated in a number of texts of dental anatomy, there is a lack of detailed case reports. 
5	Isolation of a novel tumor protein that induces resistance to natural killer cell lysis. The human metastatic tumor cell line CAP-2, produces a soluble factor that induces resistance to NK lysis of K-562 susceptible leukemia cell line, and does not inhibit the cytotoxic capacity of effector cells. The use of sequential HPLC, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and reverse phase chromatography, coupled with cytotoxic assays, resulted in the isolation and separation to homogeneity of a novel protein responsible for this biologic activity. Size estimation studies based on TSK HPLC columns showed that this protein has a mass of 8 to 12 kDa. The amino acid composition analysis of the CAP-2 protein calculated from HPLC chromatograms shows that this protein contains around 108 amino acids. Subsequent gas phase sequence analysis, however, was hampered because the N terminus of this protein was blocked and therefore unsuitable for sequencing by Edman degradation. The functional studies showed that the NK lysis-resistance activity of the CAP-2 protein is mediated by interaction with and nonspecific binding to NK target cells. The lymphokine-activated killer and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and mitogen-induced proliferation is not affected. Unexpectedly, the CAP-2 protein appears to be mitogenic to its own cell line. Thus, the induction of NK lysis-resistance and the mitogenic activity showed by CAP-2 protein could contribute to the tumor growth and metastatic establishment. 
4	Intra-aortic balloon pump for combined myocardial contusion and thoracic aortic rupture. The coexistence of myocardial contusion and thoracic aortic injury is probably more common than recognized following rapid deceleration multisystem trauma. This report describes the successful application of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in a critically injured patient requiring emergent repair of a thoracic aortic tear complicated by ventricular failure due to cardiac contusion. 
3	Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae. 
5	Patterns of chromosomal breakpoint locations in Burkitt's lymphoma: relevance to geography and Epstein-Barr virus association. We have examined, by Southern blotting, the patterns of chromosomal breakpoint locations in 55 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) with respect to geography and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association. We have confirmed the association between chromosome 8 breakpoint and geography: 74% of endemic (eBL) but only 9% of sporadic BL (sBL) had breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing the c-myc gene (P2 less than .00001). Conversely, not only did 91% of sBL manifest a rearranged HindIII fragment, but at least 56% of these cases, in contrast to 17% of eBL cases, had a breakpoint within the first exon or intron of c-myc (P2 less than .004). Breakpoints outside the switch mu (S mu) region (ie, the HindIII fragment encompassing S mu) on chromosome 14 were twice as common overall (73%) as those within S mu (27%), but in the 15 tumors with S mu breakpoints, 13 (87%) had a rearranged c-myc gene. Breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing c-myc on chromosome 8 were predominantly associated with non-S mu breakpoints on chromosome 14 (85%) and this was the combination most frequently associated with eBL (65%; 6% of sBL, P2 less than .00001). In sBL, the most frequent breakpoint combination was a rearranged c-myc gene with a non-S mu breakpoint (63%; 13% of eBL). Twenty-eight percent of sBL and 13% of eBL had breakpoints both within c-myc and within S mu. EBV DNA was present in 19 of 20 tumors with breakpoints outside c-myc, in none of 7 with a breakpoint in the immediate 5' region of c-myc, in 4 of 5 tumors with breakpoints in the first exon, and in 7 of 12 tumors with breakpoints in the first intron. These data suggest that the pathogeneses of eBL and sBL differ with regard to the mechanism of c-myc deregulation, and probably also with regard to the state of differentiation of the target cell for malignant transformation. We have formulated a testable hypothesis regarding the potential role of EBV in pathogenesis: that it is required to contribute to the deregulation of c-myc in the presence of some, but not all, types of c-myc damage arising from the chromosomal translocations. 
4	Obstruction of mechanical heart valve prostheses: clinical aspects and surgical management. One hundred patients (32 male) aged 5 months to 82 years (median 32 years) underwent 106 surgical procedures for 112 mechanical prosthetic valves obstructed by a thrombus (n = 61) or pannus (n = 7), or both (n = 44), between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989. The position of the obstructed prosthesis was aortic in 51 patients (48%), mitral in 49 (46%) and both aortic and mitral in 6 (6%). The types of obstructed prosthetic valves were Bjork-Shiley (n = 51), St. Jude (n = 41) and Medtronic-Hall (n = 20). The time interval between valve replacement and obstruction ranged from 6 weeks to 13 years (median 4 years). Of 63% of patients in whom coagulation variables were available at the time of obstruction, 70% were receiving inadequate anticoagulant therapy. In 63% of the procedures the patient was in New York Heart Association functional class IV. Two patients underwent preoperative thrombolysis with incomplete results. Operative procedures included valve replacement (n = 81), valve declotting and excision of pannus (n = 23) and aortic valve replacement and mitral valve declotting (n = 2). The early mortality rate was 12.3% (13 patients), and there was no difference between surgery for mitral prostheses (12.2%) versus aortic prostheses (13.7%). The perioperative mortality rate was 17.5% (11 of 63 patients) in patients in functional class IV and 4.7% (2 of 43 patients) in those in functional classes I to III (p less than 0.05). For valve replacement, the mortality rate was 12% (10 of 81 patients) and for declotting of the prosthesis 13% (3 of 23 patients). 
4	Venous dysfunction of late pregnancy persists after delivery. Pregnancy is associated with DVT, pelvic thrombophlebitis, and lower extremity varicosities. Pelvic venous compression by the gravid uterus is blamed. A prospective controlled study using plethysmography was performed. Venous capacitance and outflow were measured at term, and at 1 week, 6 weeks and 3 months following delivery. Results show decreased venous capacitance and venous outflow at term pregnancy, no improvement 1 week after delivery, modest improvement at 6 weeks, and dramatic statistically significant improvement in both parameters by 3 months. The persistence of venous dysfunction for several weeks after delivery indicates that changes in venous function at term pregnancy are largely the result of factors other than pelvic venous compression by the gravid uterus. 
4	Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease. 
5	Long-term results of catheter ablation of idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia Ten consecutive patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic, idiopathic, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating in the right ventricle underwent an attempt at catheter ablation of the ventricular tachycardia. There were seven women and three men, with a mean age of 39 +/- 14 years (+/- SD). None of the patients had any evidence of structural heart disease. The VT had a left bundle branch block configuration and an inferior axis in each patient, and the mean cycle length was 313 +/- 75 msec. Based on the methods of induction of the VT and the response of the VT to verapamil, the VT mechanism was presumed to be reentry in six patients, triggered activity in three patients, and catecholamine-sensitive automaticity in one patient. Sites for ablation were guided by pace mapping, and an appropriate target site was identified in the right ventricular outflow tract in each patient. From one to three shocks of 100-360 J (mean total, 336 +/- 195 J) were delivered from a defibrillator between the tip of the ablation catheter (cathode) and a patch electrode on the anterior chest (anode). An electrophysiology test 7-9 days after ablation demonstrated that VT was still inducible in only one patient, who was treated with amiodarone. One other patient had a recurrence of VT 3 weeks after ablation and was treated with verapamil. Eight of 10 patients were not treated with antiarrhythmic medications and have had no episodes of symptomatic VT during 15-68 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 33 +/- 18 months). There were no acute or long-term complications. 
1	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of soft tissue. A population-based epidemiologic and prognostic study of 137 patients. Epidemiology and prognosis were analyzed in a consecutive, population-based series of 137 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of soft tissue in the extremities and trunk wall, with a complete follow-up of minimum 3 years. All but one patient were treated by surgery in 28 cases combined with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The annual incidence was 0.42/10(5). The ratio men to women was 1.1. The median age was 64 years (range, 22 to 87 years). The thigh was the most common location. The median size was 6 cm. Superficial tumors constituted 43% and were smaller than deep-seated tumors. Eighty-three tumors were storiform-pleomorphic, 53 were myxoid, and one was of inflammatory type. The myxoid tumors were smaller and more often superficial. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 0.7, but differed markedly between the histologic types; it was 1.0 in patients with myxoid tumors and 0.5 in patients with storiform-pleomorphic tumors. In the 77 patients with storiform-pleomorphic tumors without metastases at presentation, only tumor size larger than 10 cm and tumor necrosis independently impaired survival. The 23 patients who had none of these risk factors had a 5-year survival rate of 0.8. 
5	Sudden blindness after thermocoagulation of the trigeminal ganglion. Sudden blindness during percutaneous thermocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion occurred in a 72-year-old woman with trigeminal neuralgia. Considered a safe procedure, we highlight the possibility of this serious complication which was probably due to direct damage of the optic nerve. 
4	Dependence of Doppler echocardiographic transmitral early peak velocity on left ventricular systolic function in coronary artery disease. The influence of systolic function on pulsed Doppler echocardiographic transmitral flow velocity patterns was assessed before and after postextrasystolic (PES) potentiation in 12 normal subjects (control group) and in 25 patients with previous healed myocardial infarction (MI) group. Simultaneous high-fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements were performed in all patients. A programmed single-coupled right ventricular extrasystole was induced during echocardiographic and subsequent cineangiocardiographic recordings. Adequate angiograms for volumetric analysis in both baseline and PES beats were obtained in 23 patients (7 in the control group and 16 in the MI group). PES potentiation of contraction was more pronounced in the MI group than in the control group. PES changes in ejection fraction, stroke volume and end-systolic volume were significantly greater in the MI group than in the control group (11 vs 5%, p less than 0.005; 15 vs 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.005; and -13 vs -4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01, respectively). In contrast, PES potentiation prolonged the time constants of left ventricular pressure decline derived from exponential curve fits with a zero (Tw) and non-zero (Tb) asymptote pressure in the MI group to the same extent as in the control group (4 vs 5 ms, difference not significant [NS], and 9 vs 11 ms, NS, respectively). In the PES beat, peak E velocity remained unaltered (48 vs 49 cm/s, NS) in the control group, whereas it increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) from 47 to 51 cm/s in the MI group. 
3	Eosinophilic fasciitis associated with tryptophan ingestion. A manifestation of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recently, the ingestion of tryptophan has been associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia, myalgias, and several less consistently reported findings. We treated 13 patients who exhibited clinical features of eosinophilic fasciitis who were taking high-dose tryptophan before the onset of clinical symptoms. Twelve patients exhibited eosinophilia, with eosinophil counts ranging from 0.13 to 0.88. The remaining patient was taking oral corticosteroids when her eosinophil count was determined. Eight patients complained of myalgias. Other symptoms included arthralgias, pruritus, cutaneous burning, weakness, fever, rashes, malaise, edema, muscle spasms, and alopecia. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were elevated in four of the eight urine specimens that were tested. Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed cases of eosinophilic fasciitis may represent variants of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Derangements in the metabolism of tryptophan may play a role in sclerotic diseases. 
1	Factor XIIIa in nodular malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. The distribution of factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendritic cells was studied in a series of nodular malignant melanomas and compared with that seen in Spitz naevi. Two patterns of distribution were recognizable: (a) diffusely spread through the tumour and (b) located mainly at the periphery of the tumour. These did not correlate with the diagnosis of melanoma or Spitz naevus and the distribution appeared to be a function of growth pattern of the tumour. The diffuse pattern was the most common regardless of diagnosis and the distribution of factor XIIIa-positive cells is the same in malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. 
5	Augmentation mentoplasty using Mersilene mesh. Many different materials are available for augmentation mentoplasty. However, the optimal implant material for chin implantation has yet to be found. During the past several years, a number of experienced surgeons have turned to the use of Mersilene mesh. Mersilene mesh is a non-absorbable Dacron polyester fiber that can be conformed easily into layers to achieve tailored dimensions and shape. At the McCollough Plastic Surgery Clinic PA, Birmingham, Ala, 277 patients over a 10-year period underwent chin augmentation with Mersilene mesh implants. The material provides excellent tensile strength, durability, and surgical adaptability. The overall complication rate was 3.2% (nine patients); infection rate, 2.5% (seven patients); and removal secondary to infection, 1.7% (five patients). Based on this 10-year experience, Mersilene mesh remains our material of choice for chin augmentation. 
5	Helicobacter pylori in dyspeptic patients in Kuwait. Two hundred and four patients, mainly Arabs, attending for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the gastroenterology clinic in Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital, Kuwait, were examined for evidence of infection with Helicobacter pylori and associated inflammation. Biopsy specimens of antrum, body, and duodenum; gastric juice; and antral mucosal brushings were investigated by microbiological, cytological, and histopathological methods. Clinical conditions diagnosed at endoscopy included gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenitis and duodenal ulcer, but half the patients had endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosae. H pylori was detected by one or more of the procedures in at least one specimen from 197 (96.6%) of the patients. Histological and cytological analysis showed equal sensitivity, but bacteriological culture was less reliable. The proportion of positive cases was high, compared with other reported series, which may have been accounted for by the variety of diagnostic techniques used in this study, the selected population (all with gastrointestinal symptoms) or genetic or environmental predisposing factors peculiar to the sample population. 
4	Preservation of oscillations in postocclusive reactive hyperemia. Oscillations in skin blood flow (SkBF) during postocclusive reactive hyperemia are believed to be due to locally mediated events in the microcirculation. We characterized the activity of these oscillations in nine healthy young men who underwent 0, 10, and 40 Torr of lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Postocclusive SkBF was estimated in both forearms simultaneously in a stable thermal environment with laser-Doppler velocimetry. Periodic behavior of SkBF was characterized by frequency-domain power spectral analysis. LBNP at 40 Torr increased heart rate, decreased forearm blood flow, and decreased postocclusive SkBF amplitude but did not change the periodicity of SkBF in the frequency response range that is characteristic of postischemic SkBF oscillations (0.11 +/- 0.04 Hz). We observed that LBNP did not alter the frequency response of the postocclusive SkBF as quantified in the periodogram, even though the amplitude of the SkBF was markedly diminished as a part of the general decrease in arm blood flow. We found inferential evidence for a disseminated common pacemaker mechanism that performs similarly at distant sites. We conclude that the LBNP baroreflex-mediated modulation of SkBF reduces the amplitude but does not change the frequency behavior of postocclusive SkBF. We propose on the basis of our findings that the preservation of vasomotion suggests that this phenomenon is an adaptation to the ischemic changes induced by disruption of blood flow. 
5	Tuberculous tenosynovitis of the wrist. Two case reports. Tuberculosis was first described in 1756 by Acrel in a case report. Subsequent reports of musculoskeletal tuberculosis documented the uncommon occurrence of hand and wrist involvement. The two cases presented here demonstrate the difficulty in eradicating the organism even with modern regimens of chemotherapy. Intraoperative Gram's stain and frozen sections were useful to rule out other etiologies. Firm diagnosis must be established by tissue culture. The first case appeared cured after thorough initial debridement and had no recurrence for 36 years. While recurrences are common in patients treated with debridement alone, most appear within one year after the index procedure. The amount of time that elapsed in this case is unusual and serves as a sobering reminder that tuberculosis may recur at a time distant from the initial procedure. The second patient had tuberculosis diagnosed elsewhere and was treated twice with antituberculous chemotherapy. Although the first course of therapy for six months may have been inadequate, the second course with multiple drugs for 18 months would certainly be considered adequate; yet he had a recurrence in his wrist eight months after completing treatment. These two cases illustrate the fastidious nature of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism and the need for a combined treatment protocol of meticulous surgical debridement and combined chemotherapy. 
3	Clinical and electrographic effects of acute anticonvulsant withdrawal in epileptic patients. We retrospectively investigated the effects of acute antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal on seizure symptomatology--including frequency, clinical features, and electrical onset--by studying 35 patients during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The highest risk for both partial and secondary generalized seizures occurred during absent or subtherapeutic, and not during rapidly falling, AED levels. AED withdrawal had minimal effect on clinical symptomatology or electrographic onset. 
4	Anatomic correlations of the long-axis views in biplane transesophageal echocardiography. The number of views obtainable during transesophageal echocardiography (TE) has been limited by the fixed position of the transducer at the end of the probe. This has confined standard TE studies to short-axis tomography of the heart and aorta. Recently, a biplane TE probe has become available that is capable of both long- and short-axis imaging. This study prospectively assessed the application of the long-axis plane of the biplane probe in providing complementary long-axis views in ambulatory patients. Six standard long-axis views could be obtained and were compared with corresponding anatomic sections to illustrate anatomic relations and facilitate structure identification. The long-axis views provide a better appreciation of the 3-dimensional nature of cardiac anatomy and function, especially in demonstrating the relation of vertically aligned structures. 
5	Stiff-man syndrome. Stiff-man syndrome (Moersch-Woltman syndrome) is a rare disorder of motor function characterized by involuntary stiffness of axial muscles and superimposed painful muscle spasms, which are often induced by startle or emotional stimuli. The standard treatment has been benzodiazepines. An association has been reported between stiff-man syndrome and epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes, and a variety of organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase and against pancreatic islet cells have been detected in the serum and cerebrospinal of patients with stiff-man syndrome. These findings suggest that stiff-man syndrome may be an autoimmune disease. Preliminary reports indicate that patients with stiff-man syndrome have a favorable response to plasma exchange and corticosteroid therapy. 
1	Features distinguishing secondary achalasia from primary achalasia. Eighteen patients with cancer-induced or secondary achalasia (SA) were compared to 421 patients with idiopathic or primary achalasia (PA). The aim of the study was to detect any differences in clinical presentation between the two groups. Mean age of patients with SA was 57.1 (range 15-78) and 47.1 (range 1-90) in patients with PA (p = 0.02). Three patients with SA were 15, 24, and 36 yr old, respectively. Symptom frequency was comparable in SA versus PA. Mean duration of symptoms in SA was 4.5 months, with 15 of the 18 patients experiencing symptoms for six months or less. Weight loss occurred in 88.2% of patients with SA and 57.3% of patients with PA (p less than 0.05). Cancer was at the gastroesophageal junction in 16 patients, duodenum in one, and breast in one. Endoscopy showed tumor in 12 (67%). The esophagram was suspicious for tumor in only 25%. We conclude that patients with SA are older, more likely to lose weight, and have a short duration of symptoms. However, SA may occur in younger patients, and endoscopy with biopsy is necessary in any newly diagnosed case of achalasia. 
4	A technique for improving accuracy of the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure as an estimate of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) is often used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) when artifact, respiratory variation, or technical difficulties make the wedge pressure difficult to identify on the waveform. To determine which point on the PAD waveform best estimated LVEDP, we performed studies in 100 adults undergoing routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization. During normal spontaneous respiration, simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, PAD, and LVEDP were obtained. Three end-expiratory measurements of PAD were recorded: at the lowest point on the waveform (PAD), at 0.04 seconds (PAD 0.04), and at 0.08 seconds (PAD 0.08) after the onset of the QRS complex. The PADs were correlated with LVEDP by linear regression. PAD 0.08 correlated best with LVEDP (r = 0.88, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 3.6 mm Hg) whereas PAD 0.04 and PAD correlated slightly less strongly (r = 0.86, SEE = 4.0 mm Hg; r = 0.82, SEE = 4.4 mm Hg respectively). Therefore, when the wedge pressure is not easily determined, PAD 0.08 may be the best point on the waveform to use when attempting to estimate LVEDP in the clinical setting. 
1	Clinical relevance of immunohistochemical detection of multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein in breast carcinoma In 20 women with breast carcinoma, 17 of whom had locally advanced cancer and 3 of whom had confirmed metastases, the expression of P-glycoprotein was evaluated before the start of a chemotherapy regimen that included multidrug resistance-related drugs. With the use of the C494 monoclonal antibody in an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique, P-glycoprotein was detected in 17 of 20 tumor samples. Results were expressed in a semiquantitative manner, taking into account the number of positive tumor cells (N index) and the specific staining intensity (I index). The 17 patients with nonmetastatic cancer were followed from the first cycle of chemotherapy to cancer recurrence; subsequent to six cycles of chemotherapy, all of these patients except one were rendered clinically disease-free through surgery and/or radiation. The end point was defined as either local/regional recurrence or metastasis. Strong P-glycoprotein-positive staining in a majority of tumor cells (the N+/I+ phenotype) was significantly correlated with no initial response to chemotherapy (P less than .02) and with a shorter progression-free survival (P less than .02). Thus, the pretreatment evaluation of P-glycoprotein expression may be of prognostic value in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. 
1	Giant intradiploic epidermoid tumor of the occipital bone: case report. The authors describe a case of a giant intradiploic epidermoid cyst of the occipital bone with an intracranial extension in the posterior fossa and no signs of neurological involvement. The lesion started as a painless lump under the scalp. Roentgenographic and computed tomographic findings led to a correct diagnosis, and the complete removal of the cyst was accomplished, despite its large size. The total removal of these cysts is associated with a good prognosis. 
5	Chronic pain--assessment of orthopedic physical therapists' knowledge and attitudes. Orthopedic physical therapists' knowledge of pain mechanisms and methods of pain management and their attitudes toward working with patients with benign chronic pain were studied. A random sample of 500 members of the American Physical Therapy Association's Section on Orthopaedics received by mail a 36-item questionnaire. Statistical analysis of scores, using frequencies, means, and correlations was performed on the 119 (23.8%) usable returns. All but 4% of the respondents preferred to work with patients who are not likely to have chronic pain. Seventy-two percent believed their entry-level education in pain management and theory was very inadequate or less than adequate to deal with an orthopedic patient population. Pain knowledge scores were low (35.8 out of 46 points), and the scores on positive attitudes toward treating patients with benign chronic pain were lower (20.5 out of 36 points). The study suggests specific deficiencies in orthopedic physical therapists' knowledge of clinical pain mechanisms and management and potentially undesirable attitudes toward treating patients with chronic pain. 
4	Dapsone is an effective therapy for the skin lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and urticarial vasculitis in a patient with C2 deficiency. The deficiency of second component of complement (C2d) is the most common hereditary complement deficiency. Patients with C2 deficiency are frequently associated with an auto-immune disease process, in particular, systemic lupus erythematosus (LE)-like syndrome and/or vasculitic syndrome or bacterial infections. C2d has been associated with the LE subset of subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), the presence of anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types A10, B18, DR2. We describe the clinical, serologic and immunogenetic data in a patient with manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome who developed urticarial vasculitis and photosensitive annular SCLE which were effectively treated with oral dapsone. Our case illustrates the dynamic nature of LE. 
3	Prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in stroke patients. We prospectively studied the prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in 80 patients with acute stroke and compared the 3-month mortality and disability of these patients to those of the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke. Mortality of patients with conjugate eye deviation was higher (41%) than for the general stroke population (34%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.179). Looking at mortality and disability together, we found the outcome of patients with conjugate eye deviation to be significantly worse (p less than 0.001). Deviation of the eyes occurred more frequently to the right (65%) than to the left (35%). In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01). Our results indicate that conjugate eye deviation is a prognostic factor for poor short-term mortality and disability in stroke patients, especially when the eyes are deviated to the left. 
5	Psychological reaction to hospitalization and illness in the emergency department. Each personality type presents with different methods of coping. Physicians should be aware of the impact on a patient's psychological functioning and ability to cope with illness and hospitalization, to understand and more effectively manage the patient. The physician must try to assess the patient's baseline personality from their past and present behavior. Establishing a good physician-patient relationship is important as a source of information about behavior of patients and how they will respond to their illness. Depending on the specific personality type, each patient will respond differently to the stress of illness. The effort of the emergency physician to identify personality types will aid in medical management of the patient and enable the physician to help each patient cope effectively with the illness and the hospitalization. The specific issues that seem to be threatening to traumatized patients include the following: helplessness, humiliation, blurring of body image, and gaps in memory filled with distortions. The traumatized patient experiences an altered state of consciousness which is either due to a physiologic cause or an emotional cause. Emotional causes are usually based on defensive dissociation. People who have been in an auto accident characteristically report loss of memory of the intense pain that the accident produces initially. Oftentimes, the core experience for the traumatic patient is not somatic, it is unconscious. The interesting feature is that so many patients do not remember the accident. The mind seems to be filled with all kinds of distortions and irrelevant and perhaps totally inconsistent fantasies, such as imprisonment, confinement, or deathlike experiences. Some report that they are being incarcerated, others recall being in a featureless cubicle with no contact with the normal world in which there are no windows, no pictures, no flowers. Others remember only being surrounded by masked, hatted, uniformed wardens who are standing over them with nasogastric tubes, intravenous lines, Foley catheters, arterial blood gases, subclavians, and dermal cut-downs. This is an overwhelming nightmare that can be relieved only by the empathic and caring physician and emergency department staff. The stress of medical illness and/or hospitalization can be overwhelming for some patients and is usually followed by some form of psychological response. Current understanding of the psychological impact of illness is based upon psychological defenses, coping mechanisms, and individual personality. It is the ability of the emergency physician to identify defenses, coping skills and personality types that will aid him or her in the medical management of the patients in their time of illness and hospitalization. 
5	Prevalence and correlates of increased lung/heart ratio of thallium-201 during dipyridamole stress imaging for suspected coronary artery disease. There is little information concerning the prevalence and clinical correlates of increased pulmonary thallium-201 uptake during dipyridamole thallium-201 stress imaging. Accordingly, the clinical characteristics and quantitative thallium-201 findings were correlated with quantitative lung/heart thallium-201 ratio in 87 patients undergoing dipyridamole thallium-201 stress testing. Nineteen patients (22%) had an elevated ratio (greater than 0.51). These patients were more likely to have had an infarction, to be taking beta blockers, and have a lower rate-pressure product after dipyridamole administration than those with a normal ratio (p less than 0.03). An elevated ratio was associated with a greater likelihood of initial, redistribution and persistent defects, as well as left ventricular cavity dilatation on thallium-201 imaging (p less than 0.05). In addition, the number of myocardial segments demonstrating initial, redistribution and persistent defects was also greater in patients with increased ratios (p less than 0.03). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of redistribution and left ventricular cavity dilatation were the most significant correlates of lung/heart thallium-201 ratio. It is concluded that the prevalence of increased lung/heart thallium-201 ratio with dipyridamole thallium-201 stress imaging is similar to that seen with exercise stress imaging. As with exercise thallium-201 imaging, increased pulmonary thallium-201 uptake may be a marker of functionally more significant coronary artery disease. 
4	Crico-tracheal disruption and common carotid artery occlusion: a case of blunt trauma. A case of blunt trauma to the neck is presented. While driving an all terrain vehicle (ATV), a 20-yr-old male was struck across the anterior neck by a cord suspended between two poles. Initial findings were suggestive of an isolated laryngeal injury; 48 hours later, however, a dense left hemiplegia became manifest. A CT scan demonstrated a large right frontoparietal cerebral infarct, and an angiogram confirmed occlusion of the right common carotid artery. Intractable cerebral oedema developed, and the patient died five days after the initial insult. Such injuries should alert the clinician to the possibility of major vascular injury, and if suspected, angiography is warranted. 
5	Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration as early indicator of postoperative asymptomatic recurrence in Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate in Crohn's disease the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in the early detection of postoperative asymptomatic recurrence. Eleven adult patients with small bowel Crohn's disease undergoing elective resection were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Three, six, and 12 months after surgery the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were measured, and the disease activity was assessed. All patients were free of active symptoms throughout the study. One year after surgery small bowel radiology was performed in all patients. Radiographic evidence of recurrent macroscopic disease was found in five of the 11 patients. Three months after surgery both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than before surgery. There was no difference at this time between patients with recurrence and those with no recurrence. In patients with recurrence both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration significantly increased at six months in comparison with the values at three months (P less than 0.02). Both measurements were significantly higher at six and 12 months in this group of patients than in those with no recurrence and in normal controls (P less than 0.01). At six and 12 months alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was above the upper normal limit in all patients with recurrence. We conclude that fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance is a noninvasive, inexpensive, sensitive marker of asymptomatic recurrence in CD patients who are under regular supervision after surgery. 
5	Changes in anxiety among abstinent male alcoholics. Symptoms of anxiety are prevalent features of alcoholics seeking treatment. In the present study levels of state anxiety among male primary alcoholics (with no preexisting major psychiatric disorders) were examined 3 times per week during inpatient treatment for alcoholism and again at 3 months following treatment. The 171 male alcoholics also completed the trait scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory upon admission to an inpatient program and at 3 months following treatment. Results indicate that recently detoxified males experience multiple anxiety symptoms, with 40% reporting significantly elevated levels of state anxiety at admission (greater than or equal to 75th percentile). By the second week of treatment state anxiety scores typically returned to the normal range although symptoms continued to decrease significantly with each week of continued abstinence. Elevated levels of anxiety symptoms were more common among primary alcoholics with a history of panic episodes or generalized anxiety disorder symptoms. While abstainers and relapsers did not differ in level of anxiety observed during treatment, the relapsers report significantly higher state and trait anxiety scores at follow-up. 
5	Passage of a colon 'cast' after anoabdominal rectal resection. Report of a case. The authors report a case of the passage of a total colonic J-pouch "cast" per anus after anoabdominal rectal resection and colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis. This occurred without development of cuff abscess and was not due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was successfully treated, with preservation of anal function, with resection of the colonic J-pouch by transanal approach. 
2	Intraoperative fine needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic lesions. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the practicality of intraoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 43 patients. The indication for performing this procedure was to determine the nature of pancreatic masses. Conclusive cytologic diagnoses were reached in 41 patients who represent the present study. On the basis of histologic findings in 30 cases (73.2%) and on clinical findings in 11 cases (26.8%), a final diagnosis of malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) was established in 31 and of benign pancreatic disease (BPD) in 10 patients. Among the 31 cases with MPD, the cytologic diagnosis was correct in 30 patients and falsely negative in one patient. Among 10 patients with BPD, all the cytologic finding were reported as benign. The sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values for cytologic findings were 96.8%, 100%, 100%, and 90.9%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytology was 97.6%. No complications followed the procedure. We conclude that intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions is a simple, safe, highly sensitive, and specific tool in differentiating benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. This procedure should be carried out in any patient with pancreatic mass incidentally found at laparotomy or in a patient undergoing surgery because of suspected nonmetastasizing MPD in whom repeated imaging guided FNA failed to demonstrate malignancy. 
4	Comparison of frequency of late potentials in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with advanced congestive heart failure and their usefulness in predicting sudden death. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were obtained in 62 consecutive patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing evaluation for possible heart transplantation to determine if late potentials: (1) provide unique information compared to assessment of ventricular ectopic activity on ambulatory electrocardiogram, and (2) identify a subgroup of CHF patients with higher sudden death risk. Patients with a history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia were excluded. CHF was due to old myocardial infarction in 40 patients and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 22 patients. Late potentials were present in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with old infarction but in only 3 of 22 (14%) patients with nonischemic CHF (p = 0.03). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained in 34 patients (55%). Total ventricular ectopic activity and repetitive forms of ectopy were similar in patients with and without late potentials. Nine patients died suddenly, 9 had nonsudden death, 15 underwent heart transplantation and 29 were alive and well after a mean follow-up of 218 +/- 154 days. At 1 year, the actuarial risk of death was 37% and of sudden death was 20%. Sudden death risk was 12% in patients with late potentials versus 21% in those without (p = 0.73). Thus, the incidence of the arrhythmia substrate producing late potentials depends on the CHF etiology. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiogram provide independent information for possible risk assessment in CHF. However, late potentials are poor predictors of sudden death risk when CHF is advanced, possibly due to the heterogeneity of causes of sudden death--ventricular tachycardia being only 1 of many possible mechanisms. 
5	Insensitivity of noninvasive tests to detect coronary artery vasculopathy after heart transplant. Obstructive coronary artery vasculopathy can be a major problem after cardiac transplant. The use of noninvasive tests to detect coronary artery vasculopathy was studied in 73 consecutive patients after heart transplant. Angiographically or autopsy-proved coronary artery disease was noted in 19 consecutive patients (26%) followed prospectively for 2.5 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- standard deviation). Patients underwent yearly surveillance echocardiographic, rest/exercise-gated wall motion, oral dipyridamole thallium, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor and angiographic studies. Positive test results were defined by decrease in ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality, failure to increase ejection fraction, lack of systolic blood pressure increase, and ischemic ST changes at maximal exercise (or on ambulatory monitor). Wall motion abnormalities and depressed ejection fraction on echocardiography were also abnormal studies as were fixed or reversible perfusion defects on thallium scan. Angiograms were considered positive when 50% luminal narrowing was observed and autopsy coronary artery vasculopathy was defined as cross-sectional coronary obstruction greater than or equal to 70%. No procedure that was examined proved to be a sensitive noninvasive detector of heart transplant coronary artery vasculopathy. All except ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring had positive predictive values less than 50%. Interestingly, of the techniques evaluated, echocardiography was most sensitive (53%). The poor predictive ability of noninvasive testing in this population may be due to the fact that these tests are designed to detect effects of ischemia rather than coronary obstruction alone. Use of these particular noninvasive modalities routinely after heart transplant to detect coronary artery vasculopathy should be reconsidered because of their low sensitivity and predictive value when used as a surveillance screen. 
4	Cardiopulmonary perfusion and cerebral blood flow in bilateral carotid artery disease The fear of cerebral complications after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heart disease and severe carotid artery disease has led many authors to suggest combined approaches in these patients. The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery. A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity. We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease. The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting. The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg. The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12). The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges. In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia. These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit. The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner. 
4	Cellular immunodeficiency in protein-losing enteropathy. Predominant reduction of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. Cellular immunological abnormalities were studied in a patient with protein-losing enteropathy associated with constrictive pericarditis. Analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood showed lymphopenia with a decrease of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes, B cells and NK cells were within the normal range. Fecal loss of lymphocytes as a cause of lymphopenia was evidenced by a marked excretion of 111-indium-labeled peripheral blood mononuclear cells via stool. Proliferative responses against several mitogens were severely reduced as was in vitro IgG production. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against a variety of antigens was absent. Vaccination with tick-borne encephalitis virus, used for primary immunization, and with the recall antigen tetanus toxoid resulted in a blunted antibody response. After pericardectomy, the severity of enteric protein loss declined, serum immunoglobulin levels returned to the normal range, and total lymphocytes and CD3+ and CD4+ counts increased but remained low even 12 months after surgery. Fecal loss of lymphocytes was found to be reduced after pericardectomy, but was higher than that seen in a disease control patient with active inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro immunoglobulin production returned to normal, DTH could be demonstrated against purified protein derivative and proteus antigen, but mitogen-driven blastogenic response of lymphocytes remained low. Revaccination with tick-borne encephalitis and tetanus toxoid antigens seven months after surgery resulted in a dramatic increase of serum levels of antibodies against both antigens, comparable to that seen in healthy control individuals. 
3	Seizures in the alcoholic patient. The First International Symposium on Alcohol and Seizures (September 1988, Washington, DC) convened experts from North America and Europe to discuss the basic and clinical research findings in this field. Most of the observations communicated at this symposium are included in this article. Emergency physicians are familiar with the alcoholic patient who presents during or after a seizure(s). This familiarity must not obscure the fact that a significant minority of these patients will have an underlying process that can cause morbidity or mortality if the unsuspecting physician does not have an organized and methodic approach to the evaluation and management of the seizing alcoholic patient. Status epilepticus should be evaluated and treated in a similar fashion, whether or not the patient is an alcoholic. Otherwise, almost without exception, there are nuances and controversies with respect to the evaluation and management of the alcoholic patient with a seizure(s), from the indications for CT scan, to the proper role of sedatives and anticonvulsants, and the need for admission. The emergency physician must remain a patient advocate. The great majority of alcoholic patients with seizures who require admission can be treated satisfactorily at the hospital of presentation. 
4	Elevated plasma beta-endorphin levels in patients with congestive heart failure Recent experimental studies show that the opioid system is important to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular impairment in congestive heart failure. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were measured in 37 patients with congestive heart failure and compared with those of 21 age- and gender-matched normal subjects. The relation of plasma beta-endorphin levels and cardiac function at rest and exercise capacity was assessed in 17 of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Exercise capacity was determined by symptom-limited maximal treadmill exercise with expired gas analysis. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were elevated and correlated with the patients' New York Heart Association functional cardiac status (control: 14.0 +/- 4.4 pg/ml; class II: 17.9 +/- 3.6 pg/ml; class III: 28.3 +/- 8.8 pg/ml; class IV: 46.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml, mean +/- SD). No relation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels and left ventricular systolic performance as assessed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were negatively correlated with cardiac output determined by Doppler echocardiography and positively correlated with systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.733, r = 0.747, respectively, both p less than 0.001), but not correlated with calf blood flow as measured by a plethysmography. A good correlation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels at rest and exercise capacity. The correlations with peak oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold, and peak rate-pressure product were r = -0.721, -0.672, and -0.674, respectively (p less than 0.01). The data show that plasma beta-endorphin levels are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure and reflect, to some degree, the severity of the disease. 
3	Nontropical pyomyositis as a cause of subacute, multifocal myalgia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We report a case of nontropical pyomyositis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection, in which severe myalgia was the presenting symptom over several weeks. Multifocal muscle lesions were identified by gallium scanning and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The epidemiology, possible pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic imaging, and therapy are reviewed. Early suspicion of nontropical pyomyositis in severely immunocompromised patients with "cryptic" myalgia is recommended. 
3	Causes of death in the elderly and their changing pattern in Hisayama, a Japanese community. Results from a long-term and autopsy-based study. The causes of death for the elderly were prospectively studied in Hisayama, Japan, a rural community. We compared 1,621 subjects, aged 40 years or over, recruited in 1961, and 2,053 subjects recruited in 1974. Each cohort was studied in a follow-up that lasted 10 years; they had autopsy rates of 82.1% and 86.1% during each 10-year period, respectively. The most common causes of death for those aged 70 years or over were cerebrovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and pneumonia. Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease tended to decrease in the recent cohort, but the proportion of decline was more prominent in cases aged 40 to 69 years. There was a sex difference in the changing pattern of mortality from heart diseases including ischemic heart disease. Deaths by both heart diseases and ischemic heart disease increased in the more recent cohort of aged women, whereas they decreased in the aged men. Pneumonia was an important cause of death for the elderly in both cohorts. Deaths due to "senility" were rare, being only 1% of the deceased aged 70 or over. With prolonged lifespan, especially for women, the impact of atherosclerosis and its related disorders on the recent Japanese aged population appears to have increased. 
1	Clinicopathologic characteristics of adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. Fifty-six cases of surgically resected adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung were studied clinicopathologically, and their outcome was compared with that of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. The frequency rate of adenosquamous carcinoma was 2.6% of 2160 primary lung cancers resected in the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The survival curves of patients with adenosquamous carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas indicated that the outcome of adenosquamous carcinoma was poorer than that of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in Stages I and II. The amount of adenocarcinoma component did not affect the survival rate, although the histologic features of metastatic lymph nodes was somewhat influenced by the histologic type of the primary tumors. The histologic subtype of adenosquamous carcinoma was one of the independent prognostic determinants. 
4	Value of ventricular electrogram recordings in the diagnosis of arrhythmias precipitating electrical device shock therapy. An antitachycardia pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillator that is capable of storing ventricular electrograms before and after delivery of device shock therapy was implanted in 16 patients. Three of the patients experienced out-of-hospital device shock therapy preceded by minimal symptoms. Although limitations of electrogram analysis exist and are discussed, careful analysis and registration of electrograms during all supraventricular and ventricular rhythms observed during in-hospital testing served as an important reference for subsequent arrhythmia diagnosis. By analyzing the electrogram rate and RR interval stability and configuration, a definitive diagnosis was established in all three patients (atrial fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and rate-sensing lead disruption, respectively). Thus, the ability to store ventricular electrograms before shock therapy represents a major advance in the management of patients who receive an electrical device to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmia. 
4	Captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice. I have reported a case of captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice. This drug is being used with increasing frequency, so it is important that physicians recognize this adverse effect. Captopril-induced jaundice resolves after cessation of captopril therapy. 
1	Survival after groin dissection for malignant melanoma. Groin dissection was performed in 158 patients with malignant melanoma (superficial dissection, 76 patients; radical dissection, 82 patients). Of 63 patients with palpable nodes, 57 patients (90%) had histologic involvement. Of 93 patients with nonpalpable nodes, 31 patients (33%) had histologically positive nodes. The 5-year survival rate for patients with histologically negative nodes (n = 69) was 77%; the 5-year survival rate for patients with histologically positive nodes (n = 89) was 43%. The respective 5-year disease-free survival rates were 72% and 34%. Of 57 patients with palpable, positive inguinal nodes, 21 patients (37%) had involvement of the deep nodes. Of 31 patients with nonpalpable, histologic involvement of the inguinal nodes, six patients (19%) had or developed involvement of the deep nodes. One of two patients with uncertain clinical status of the nodes preoperatively had positive deep nodes. In prophylactic node dissection, frozen section of the inguinal group of the nodes does not provide a reliable method, because of sampling errors, in determining microscopic involvement of the nodes and in deciding whether a superficial or radical groin dissection is to be done. For patients with positive nodes the 5-year survival rate was 48% when only the inguinal group was involved and was 28% when both inguinal and deep nodes were involved; the respective 5-year disease-free survival rates were 39% and 20%. Survival after therapeutic groin dissection may partly depend on the thoroughness of the procedure. Patients who have positive, deep nodes and who are undergoing an incontinuity dissection of the inguinal, iliac, and obturator nodes have an appreciable 5-year survival rate. 
2	Pancreatic response to percutaneous biliary drainage: a prospective study. To evaluate the effects of percutaneous biliary drainage (PBD) on the pancreas, serum amylase levels were measured for 7 consecutive days after PBD and compared with baseline values in 50 patients who underwent a total of 53 PBD procedures. Of the 45 patients with normal baseline serum amylase levels, 12 patients (24%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia without clinical symptoms and five patients (10%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia with clinical signs of pancreatitis. Five patients who presented with elevated baseline serum amylase levels demonstrated decreases into the normal range after placement of stents without initiation of bowel rest or liquid diet. The level of biliary obstruction proved insignificant, as did the nature of the obstructing disease, in determining which patients would experience hyperamylasemia or pancreatitis after PBD. It is concluded that the frequency of pancreatic insult from PBD may be more common than previously reported and that patient susceptibility is not dependent on the level of biliary obstruction or the nature of the disease. 
3	Neuroanatomy of fragile X syndrome: the posterior fossa. The occurrence and specificity of posterior fossa abnormalities as measured from magnetic resonance images of the brain were investigated in a group of 14 males with fragile X syndrome and comparison groups consisting of 17 males with other causes of developmental disability and 18 males with normal IQs. The size of the posterior cerebellar vermis was significantly decreased and the fourth ventricle significantly increased in the group of males with fragile X syndrome compared with males in both comparison groups. These neuroanatomical abnormalities appeared to be secondary to hypoplasia rather than atrophy. 
5	Helicobacter pylori infection in pernicious anemia: a prospective controlled study. Although some authors believe that Helicobacter pylori is the etiologic agent in chronic nonspecific gastritis, it has also been suggested that the bacterium colonizes inflamed mucosa as a secondary event. This study documents the prevalence of H. pylori in 28 patients with pernicious anemia and compares the findings with those of a group of 28 age-, race-, and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects. All subjects underwent endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric antrum and corpus. A sample of serum was obtained before endoscopy for determination of antibodies (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) to H. pylori. The prevalence of H. pylori (by biopsy) in patients with pernicious anemia was significantly less than that in controls (11% vs. 71%, P less than 0.0001). All patients with pernicious anemia had abnormalities of corpus histology (inflammation and/or atrophy). In addition, 50% of patients with pernicious anemia had a lymphocytic infiltration of the antrum. All controls with H. pylori had gastritis, 50% having active chronic gastritis. Atrophic changes of the corpus were more commonly found in patients with pernicious anemia (75% vs. 7%, P less than 0.0001). Serology and biopsy results correlated poorly in the patients with pernicious anemia: all 5 patients with positive serology results had negative biopsy results, whereas all 3 patients with positive cultures on biopsy had negative serological studies. In conclusion, patients with pernicious anemia are protected from infection with H. pylori, and H. pylori does not passively colonize mucosa inflamed by an unrelated process. 
2	Crohn's disease and pregnancy. Seventy-eight pregnancies in 50 patients were reviewed to evaluate the effects of Crohn's disease on the outcome of pregnancy and the influence of the pregnancy on the course of Crohn's disease. Overall, 21 pregnancies (27 percent) had abnormal outcomes including spontaneous abortions (9), infants small for gestational age (6), premature infants (5), and infants who developed respiratory distress (1). Eight (50 percent) patients with active disease compared with 13 (21 percent) patients with inactive disease at conception had abnormal outcomes (P less than 0.05). During pregnancy 15 (55 percent) with active disease and 6 (12 percent) with inactive disease had an abnormal outcome (P less than 0.001). Neither medical nor surgical treatment, independent of disease activity, appeared to affect the outcome adversely. Eighteen of 73 (25 percent) patients with quiescent or mild disease relapsed, and seven of 16 patients with some disease activity improved (44 percent). Of 34 patients on medication, nine relapsed (27 percent), and of 39 patients not on medication, nine relapsed (24 percent) (P = N.S.). These results suggest that the outcome of pregnancy is not adversely affected by Crohn's disease. However, patients with active disease at conception and/or during the pregnancy have poorer outcomes independent of the use of medication or requirement of surgery. Neither pregnancy nor medications taken affect the course of the disease. 
5	Injury biomechanics of the human cervical column. In this study, the authors have developed a technique to replicate clinically relevant traumatic cervical spine injuries and determined the injury biomechanics. Because of the importance of compressive forces in neck injuries, this research was conducted using compression as the primary load vector. Six fresh human cadaveric head-neck complexes were prepared by fixing the distal end in methylmethacrylate. Tests were done with varying loading rates to include quasistatic and dynamic conditions. For quasistatic experiments, the proximal end was fixed to the piston of the testing device. In dynamic tests, the cranium was unconstrained, and to maintain stability, the effects of the spinal musculature were simulated by means of pulleys, deadweights, and springs in the anterior and posterior parts of the head-neck complex. Quasistatic tests conducted at a rate of 2.0 mm/sec produced cervical spine trauma at forces ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 kN, with deformations ranging from 2.2 to 3.7 cm. The specimens were deep-frozen at the level of injury, preserving the local deformation of the tissues to enable a detailed evaluation immediately after the injury. Dynamic tests conducted at velocities of 3.2 to 5.7 m/sec resulted in impact injuries at one level of the head-neck complex. The applied forces at the vertex were considerably higher than those recorded at the distal end. The failure deformations for both the quasistatic (2.2-3.7 cm) and dynamic (1.7-3.2 cm) tests, however, were found to be similar, suggesting that the human head-neck complex is a deformation-sensitive structure. 
4	Physical examination and echo Doppler study in the assessment of femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization. Femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization have been well recognized. The development of an inguinal mass in these patients can represent a simple hematoma, a pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula. The utility of the physical examination in diagnosing these complications was assessed by using the echo Doppler study for comparison. This study shows that any single clinical sign should not be used in isolation, but a constellation of physical findings can suggest the correct diagnosis. 
1	Nuclear grading of breast carcinoma by image analysis. Classification by multivariate and neural network analysis. The use of nuclear grade as a prognostic indicator for breast carcinoma has been limited by interobserver variability. Advances in image analysis and automated cell classification offer one approach to this problem. The authors used the CAS-100 (Cell Analysis System. Elmhurst, IL) system to measure and analyze nuclear morphometric and texture features of cytologic preparations from 35 breast carcinomas (well, moderate, and poorly differentiated) as well as benign lesions. Morphometric and Markovian texture feature data from breast cancer nuclei of various grades comprised a training set, which was then used to establish classification criteria by multivariate (Bayesian) analysis and to train a neural network system. Both systems were tested for the ability to classify the nuclear grade of individual nuclei. There was good agreement between computer classification and the grade assigned by human observer to individual nuclei using either Bayesian or neural network analysis. Thirty-one unknown cases, which were assigned an overall grade by an observer, were then analyzed by computer, and an overall grade assigned based on the grade of nucleus most frequently present. Using this method, both classification systems were able to assign a "correct" grade to low-grade lesions (approximately 70% correct) more often than to high-grade tumors (approximately 20%). Difficulty in computer assignment of high-grade tumors was explained by nuclear heterogeneity in these tumors (i.e., although the percentage of high-grade nuclei was increased compared with that of low-grade tumors, high-grade nuclei frequently did not predominate). The authors present this study to demonstrate the feasibility of using image analysis as an objective means of nuclear grading. Further studies will be needed to establish criteria for assigning overall nuclear grade based on computer analysis of imaging data. 
2	Which clinical variables predict an abnormal double-contrast barium enema result? OBJECTIVE: To determine the relations among patient history, symptoms, objective indicators, and abnormal double-contrast barium enema results in outpatients. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Seven hundred and ninety-four patients receiving care in a large multispecialty medical group. DESIGN: Physicians completed a form before ordering a double-contrast barium enema, listing information about patient history, symptoms, and objective findings, including the results of a complete blood count, stool hemoccult, and sigmoidoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures were colon cancer and any abnormal finding. The results of 18.6% of the barium enemas were abnormal. The most frequent positive findings were of polyps (8.8%) and colon cancer (2.9%). Over 50% of the barium enemas were ordered solely on the basis of symptoms, yet there was no statistical correlation between symptoms and colon cancer or any positive finding. Using logistic regression, four variables were shown to be significant predictors of colon cancer (P less than 0.05): abnormal sigmoidoscopy, iron deficiency anemia, positive stool hemoccult results, and relevant history. The respective odds ratios of these variables were 3.76 (95% CI, 2.89 to 4.90); 2.86 (CI, 2.13 to 3.74); 1.87 (CI, 1.46 to 2.39); and 1.91 (CI, 1.44 to 2.52), respectively. In a patient without any of these indicators, the predicted probability of having colon cancer was only 0.7%. In a patient with at least two objective indicators, the probability of having colon cancer was greater than 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms without objective indicators or pertinent risk factors do not correlate with an abnormal double-contrast barium enema result. Objective indicators are useful predictors of an abnormal barium enema result, particularly when looking for colon cancer. 
4	IgG and IgA antibodies to the collagen-like region of C1q in rheumatoid vasculitis. We investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q in serum samples from 80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 31 patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and 80 healthy controls. IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were found in less than 5% of the sera from RA patients and from healthy controls. In contrast, IgG and IgA antibodies to C1q were found in 29% and 61%, respectively, of the sera from patients with rheumatoid vasculitis. The occurrence of IgA antibodies to C1q has not been previously demonstrated. These results also demonstrate that IgG antibodies to C1q do not occur exclusively in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: Sera of patients with rheumatoid vasculitis frequently contain IgG or IgA antibodies to C1q, which contribute to immune complex formation. 
3	Steroids induce acetylcholine receptors on cultured human muscle: implications for myasthenia gravis. Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which are diagnostic of the human autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, block AChR function and increase the rate of AChR degradation leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission. Steroids are frequently used to alleviate symptoms of muscle fatigue and weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis because of their well-documented immunosuppressive effects. We show here that the steroid dexamethasone significantly increases total surface AChRs on cultured human muscle exposed to myasthenia gravis sera. Our results suggest that the clinical improvement observed in myasthenic patients treated with steroids is due not only to an effect on the immune system but also to a direct effect on muscle. We propose that the identification and development of pharmacologic agents that augment receptors and other proteins that are reduced by human genetic or autoimmune disease will have broad therapeutic applications. 
1	Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of head and neck lesions. The case records of 213 fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of head and neck masses performed on 209 patients over a 3-year period were reviewed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of this technique in comparison with surgical histologic examination. Cytologic diagnoses based on FNAB were compared with histologic diagnoses in 110 patients who underwent surgery. Based on cytology alone, 40.3% of the lesions were reported as malignant, 45.1% as benign, and 14.6% as indeterminant. A specific cytologic diagnosis was made in 85.5% of the cases. Cytologic diagnoses concurred with surgical histologic diagnoses 90% of the time. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was found to have a false-positive rate of 0.5% and a false-negative rate of 2.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of FNAB in determining a malignant diagnosis were 81.1% and 99%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated at 98.9% and 82.8%, respectively. Diagnostic rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value increased consistently throughout the study period, indicating that the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB improved with experience. 
5	Carcinoma of the pancreas: a retrospective review. Eighty-five patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed in order to evaluate the efficacy of our methods of diagnosis and treatment. The most useful diagnostic test was percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) with a diagnostic rate of 96%. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) and total pancreatic resection were performed in 13 and 2 patients, respectively. The remaining 50 patients underwent various palliative drainage procedures. Twenty patients did not undergo operation for various reasons. The primary tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in 50 patients (59%), the body in 6 patients (7%), and in the tail in 8 patients (9%). Postoperative complications, including sepsis, bleeding, intra-abdominal abscesses, and anastomotic leaks, occurred in 37% of the patients. There were one operative and 9 postoperative deaths. The average survival for those patients undergoing surgical intervention was 6 months. There were no 5-year survivors. 
5	Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis in experimentally induced cholestasis in rat. The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid. 
1	Carcinosarcoma of the lung with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Carcinosarcoma of the lung is a rare malignancy. Endobronchial and parenchymal variants are classically described. Clinicopathological features are often related to anatomical location, as is the case for most lung neoplasms. This case report details the surgical management of a carcinosarcoma in a patient seen with pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 
1	Diagnosis of noninfective cardiac mass lesions by two-dimensional echocardiography. Comparison of the transthoracic and transesophageal approaches. This study was conducted in 46 patients with cardiac thrombi, 15 patients with atrial myxomas, and 32 patients with other cardiac or paracardiac tumors. Diagnoses were subsequently proven by surgery, autopsy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography in all patients. All patients underwent precordial and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography to assess the various mass detection rates. Atrial myxomas and predominantly left-sided cardiac tumors were identified by both echocardiographic techniques with comparable detection rates. Left ventricular apical thrombi were detected more frequently by precordial echocardiography. In contrast, transesophageal echocardiography was superior in visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi, small and flat thrombi in the left atrial cavity, thrombi and tumors in the superior vena cava, and masses attached to the right heart and the descending thoracic aorta. These data indicate that transesophageal echocardiography leads to a clinically relevant improvement of the diagnostic potential in patients in whom cardiac masses are suspected or have to be excluded in order to ensure the safety of clinical procedures. 
1	CD34 antigen expression in children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One characteristic of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph')-positive acute leukemia is the occasional presence of both lymphoid and myeloid features in the same leukemia. This phenomenon supports the theory that this subtype of acute leukemia arises from lymphoid-myeloid stem cell, pluripotent progenitors. Very few reports, however, describe the immunophenotype, especially CD34 antigen, of Ph'-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia. These findings suggest the involvement of a pluripotent stem cell in Ph'-positive ALL. 
1	Endothelial markers in malignant vascular tumours of the liver: superiority of QB-END/10 over von Willebrand factor and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. A new monoclonal antibody, QB-END/10, raised against the CD34 antigen in human endothelial cell membranes and haemopoietic progenitor cells, was studied for its usefulness as a marker of neoplastic vascular cells in 21 angiosarcomas and seven malignant haemangioendotheliomas of the liver. QB-END/10 was both more sensitive and more specific than Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Ulex europaeus 1 agglutinin (UEA-1) in labelling endothelial cells and it did not cross react with epithelia as UEA-1 often does. Staining was uniformly strong and clear in all histological variants of these two tumours. QB-END/10 should prove particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of malignant vascular tumours of the liver. 
5	Endoscopic management of chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach. Endoscopic correction of the chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach was attempted in seven cases of primary and three cases of secondary volvulus. Endoscopic correction was successful in six cases of primary volvulus and one case of volvulus secondary to duodenal carcinoma. This paper describes the details of the technique of endoscopic correction of gastric volvulus, and documentation of correction of the volvulus by barium meal study with a follow-up of 5-26 months. 
3	Syncope and presyncope associated with probable adverse drug reactions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether syncope and presyncope were associated with drug therapy in 70 patients referred to a tertiary care ambulatory clinic. Drug use information was obtained, validated, and classified by its potential to cause syncope and presyncope. Utilizing a standardized adverse drug reaction algorithm, nine (13%) of the 70 patients were rated as having probable drug-induced syncope and presyncope events. Overall, 12 medications were implicated. Patients with probable adverse drug reactions were older, and taking more medications, or taking an antihypertensive. Seven of the nine patients with probable adverse drug reactions were previously classified as having syncope of unknown origin after their initial clinic evaluation. Syncope and presyncope are commonly associated with adverse drug reactions, especially in the elderly and those taking multiple medications. 
5	The impact of quitting smoking on symptoms of chronic bronchitis: results of the Scottish Heart Health Study. Scotland has high rates of death from diseases of the respiratory system and high rates of smoking, especially among women. Data on self reported smoking and prevalence of chronic cough and chronic phlegm among 10,359 men and women aged 40-59 years were obtained from the Scottish Heart Health Study. Overall, current cigarette smokers had rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm four to five times those of never smokers after standardisation for age (32.3% v 6.5% for men and 24% v 5.5% for women for chronic cough; 31% v 8.3% for men and 21% v 5.5% for women for chronic phlegm). Ex-smokers' symptom rates were a little above those of never smokers and were significant for chronic cough among women and chronic phlegm among men. Men had higher symptom rates than women and this was true for smokers, ex-smokers, and never smokers. The higher rates among men could not be explained by higher cotinine concentrations. Tests to detect "deceivers" among ex-smokers and never smokers using biochemical validation suggested that 87 (1.5%) respondents were in fact smoking; they were excluded from analyses. There were substantially lower rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm within a year of stopping smoking, and two to four years after stopping 89-99% of the difference between current smokers and never smokers was accounted for (99% and 93% for men and women with chronic cough, 96% and 89% for men and women with chronic phlegm). Even 10 years after stopping, rates of symptoms among ex-smokers remained a little above those of never smokers (except for women with chronic phlegm), though these differences were not statistically significant. Former heavy smokers continued to have rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm that were higher than those of former light and moderate smokers (though not significantly so). These are cross sectional data, but they emphasise the importance for chronic bronchitis symptoms of giving up cigarette smoking, though the amount previously smoked continues to exert a small influence. 
5	Hyaline ring granuloma: a distinct oral entity. Hyaline ring granuloma (HRG) is a distinct oral entity. In this study, 64 cases from the literature are analyzed and two new cases are reported. The lesions could be classified by location as central hyaline ring granuloma (42%) and peripheral hyaline ring granuloma (53%). Radiographically, a radiolucent area irregularly outlined by well-formed trabeculae of bone was found in central HRG, and a poorly defined erosion at the crest of the alveolar ridge was often found in peripheral HRG. Occasionally, the lesion occurred in the connective tissue wall of cysts (5%). The etiology of this condition is controversial, but most lesions were in edentulous areas and most patients had a history of tooth extraction or other trauma. The majority of cases (83%) occurred in the mandible, usually posterior to the premolar. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 43 years, and the male/female ratio was 1.9:1. Pain was not a symptom, although local discomfort, such as recurrent swelling and tenderness, was noted in many cases. Hyaline rings with giant cell inclusions are the significant features for histopathologic diagnosis. HRG is treated by curettage or surgical excision, care being taken to remove the entire lesion. The removal of a peripheral HRG in an edentulous jaw should be followed by careful smoothing of the bone surface, since the lesion tends to infiltrate and is not well demarcated. Recurrence, probably due to incomplete excision, is uncommon. 
5	Voltage criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy in sudden and nonsudden coronary artery disease mortality: the Italian section of the Seven Countries Study. It is unclear whether sudden or nonsudden death can be predicted independently from other risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, this investigation was undertaken to measure 12-lead QRS voltage sum, a recently proposed (Am J Cardiol 1985;55:485-494) index of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and its ability to predict either subsequent sudden (less than 2 hours) or nonsudden CAD death during 20 to 23 years of follow-up in 1,588 middle aged men (40 to 61 years old) from 2 cohorts of the Italian section of the Seven Countries Study who were free of demonstrable CAD (at entry examination in 1962). The Sokolow-Lyon and the modified Sokolow-Lyon indexes, 2 standard electrocardiographic methods to detect LV hypertrophy were also measured and compared. During follow-up, 67 patients died suddenly and 87 died a nonsudden CAD death. In the Cox proportional-hazards model, age, mean blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, smoking habit, ST-T alterations (Minnesota codes 4.1 to 4.3 together with 5.1 to 5.3) and the 3 electrocardiographic indexes, all measured at the time of enrollment into the study, were included. The 12-lead QRS voltage sum retained significant and independent relation to sudden death (t = 2.00); Sokolow-Lyon index entered the Cox solution for nonsudden CAD death but the association was inverse (t = -2.10). ST-T alterations were significantly associated only with nonsudden CAD death (t = 2.19). Thus, in addition to several known risk factors, measurement of 12-lead QRS voltage sum in middle-aged men without clinical evidence of heart disease may help identify subjects at an increased risk of sudden death; nonsudden CAD death is predicted by Sokolow-Lyon index and by ST-T alterations. The usefulness of these indexes needs to be tested in different populations. 
5	Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with hemoptysis. A 53-year-old man who had previously undergone resection of a left ventricular aneurysm was admitted because of hemoptysis. Preoperative evaluation with computed tomographic scan and cardiac catheterization demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior ventricular wall measuring 16 cm in diameter with protrusion into the left hemithorax. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was a defect in the ventricular wall extending from the base of the mitral valve annulus to the insertion of the posterior papillary muscle. Operative repair was performed using an albumin-coated, low-porosity Dacron patch. 
3	Cerebral blood flow in progressive aphasia without dementia. Case report, using 133xenon inhalation, technetium 99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime and single photon emission computerized tomography. We report a case of progressive aphasia without clinical signs of intellectual or behavioral impairment, satisfying Mesulam's clinical criteria of primary progressive aphasia, as 4 yrs of extensive psychometric testing and radiological imaging, comprising CT and MRI, failed to detect evidence of relevant involvement outside the left perisylvian regions. Cranial CT was normal but MRI showed multiple bilateral lesions in the deep white matter. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies by single photon emission computerized tomography, however, showed an initial frontotemporal focus of hypoperfusion that progressively extended to include most of the ipsilateral hemisphere and the contralateral frontal lobe. This suggests that CBF imaging may yet be the most sensitive technique in revealing subclinical injury in the degenerative brain diseases of focal onset. 
1	Anionic complex-carbohydrate units of human thyroglobulin. Human thyroglobulin (hTG) contains sulfate in chondroitin 6-sulfate chains and in complex carbohydrates. In this study the sulfate-containing complex carbohydrates were characterized by the number of sulfate and sialic acid residues that they contain. Samples of normal and nodular thyroid tissue were incubated for 16 h in [35S]sulfate-containing medium, and hTG was purified from the tissues and the media. Complex carbohydrates were enzymatically removed from hTG. Subsequent analysis on an HPLC anion exchange column at pH 2.2 separated the carbohydrate units according to their number of negative charges. Sulfate-containing peaks were monitored by radioactivity, and sialic acid-containing peaks were identified by their shift to lower charge after treatment with neuraminidase. Peaks corresponding to sialic acid-free carbohydrate units with one to four sulfates were identified. Also, carbohydrate units with two and three negative charges containing both sulfate and sialic acid were present. In the nodular tissue of one patient there were more sulfated units with higher charge, especially units containing sialic acid. In this patient the proportion of sulfated polyvalent units with sialic acid was 22.4% for normal and 64.6% for nodular tissue. No difference in the composition of the charged units between the tissues and their corresponding media was seen, making it unlikely that the sulfate-containing carbohydrates play a role in hTG release. It is concluded that hTG contains complex carbohydrate units with up to four sulfate groups and units with both sulfate and sialic acid. In some patients, the sulfate-containing anionic carbohydrate units of hTG from normal and nodular thyroid tissue are different. 
5	Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy associated with open-heart surgery. The incidence of phrenic nerve palsy after open-heart surgery has been estimated at 10%, but it is usually unilateral and does not cause symptoms. Bilateral phrenic nerve injury after coronary artery bypass surgery is a rare complication. This case report describes a patient who developed bilateral phrenic nerve palsies and required prolonged ventilatory support. Denervation of both hemidiaphragms was documented by needle electromyography four weeks after bypass surgery. The patient required total ventilatory support for three months and partial ventilatory support for an additional three months. This case demonstrates the usefulness of electromyographic screening for documentation and prognostication after phrenic nerve injury. The cause of the lesion was unclear, but hypothermia and stretch were leading hypotheses. This patient developed the phrenic nerve palsies despite using a cardiac insulation pad. 
3	Progressive coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension: report of two cases. Two cases of neurological deterioration and coma after the transsphenoidal decompression of a pituitary adenoma with marked suprasellar extension and invasion of the 3rd ventricle are presented. Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. 
3	Vertebrobasilar occlusion following minor trauma in an 8-year-old boy. An 8-year-old boy developed seizures and coma 2 days after a trivial bicycle accident. Computed tomography failed to show pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed infarction of the pons and right cerebellum. Angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral and basilar arteries. Minor traumatic injuries to the cervical spine may result in vertebrobasilar occlusion. The neurologic manifestations of this disorder and emergency department diagnosis and management are discussed. 
2	A coproporphyria-like syndrome induced by glipizide. A 49-year-old man with a 1-month history of episodic, severe abdominal pain sought medical attention. The patient's history was remarkable for type II diabetes, for which glipizide therapy had been initiated 2 months earlier. No other medications were being taken at the time the paroxysms of pain began. During the episodes of pain, both examination of the abdomen and abdominal roentgenograms revealed normal findings. Initial assessment, including ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning of the abdomen, upper gastrointestinal and colon roentgenograms, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealed no cause of the pain. Empiric trials of famotidine, sucralfate, and antacids failed to relieve the pain. Both urine and fecal specimens collected after an attack demonstrated substantially increased coproporphyrins. The glipizide regimen was discontinued; 2 months later, the stool coproporphyrins had decreased to normal levels. At follow-up more than 1 year later, the patient had had no recurrence of abdominal pain. Although other orally administered hypoglycemic agents and other sulfa compounds have been reported to precipitate acute attacks of porphyria, to our knowledge this is the first such case associated with glipizide. We suggest that glipizide be added to the list of medications to be avoided in patients with porphyria. 
1	Human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunosuppression: a risk factor for human papillomavirus infection. In a group of 92 women with genital condylomata, 15 (16.3%) human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients were found, whereas no case was detected in a control group of 100 women. The relative risk was greater than 19.28. Human immunodeficiency-positive status was associated with other parameters: lower age and parity, major frequency of induced abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases. Thus although human immunodeficiency-positive status seems to be a true risk factor in relation to the altered immunologic state, an indirect association cannot be discarded. Such patients should be screened closely for human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer. Among human immunodeficiency-positive women, a more resistant behavior of human papillomavirus-associated lesions was detected (recurrence-persistence of 41.7% versus 12%), a fact that might also be in relation to the immunodepressed status. 
2	Delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation: a complication of anterior spine surgery. Stabilization of the cervical spine is often accomplished via an anterior cervical approach. Bone grafts and/or plates and screws are used to achieve stabilization. Injuries to the pharynx and esophagus are known complications in anterior exposure of the cervical spine. These injuries are manifest in the early postoperative period. Reports of late perforations are very rare. We present four cases of delayed injury to the pharynx and esophagus that resulted in abscess or fistula. We postulate that graft displacement with resulting erosion was responsible for these serious complications. Postoperative odynophagia in patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion warrants evaluation of the bone graft location. Early surgical intervention and repair may decrease prolonged morbidity in these patients. 
4	Effects of inosine on glycolysis and contracture during myocardial ischemia. The effects of inosine (INO) on substrate metabolism and rigor formation in ischemic myocardium were examined in isolated rabbit hearts. Metabolite content was assessed in tissue extracts by chemical analysis and in the whole heart by 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In ischemic hearts metabolizing either [3-13C]pyruvate or [1-13C]glucose, 1 mM INO increased both total and 13C-labeled alanine content; lactate content was unaffected. At 3 minutes of ischemia, tissue alanine was 1.81 +/- 0.11 microM/g wet wt (mean +/- SEM) in hearts perfused with pyruvate+INO versus 1.23 +/- 0.15 microM/g wet wt in hearts perfused with pyruvate alone (p less than 0.05). INO reduced tissue glycogen during ischemia in pyruvate-perfused hearts. Tissue alanine content in ischemic hearts that were supplied glucose+INO (1.29 +/- 0.13 microM/g wet wt) was greater than in ischemic hearts supplied glucose alone (0.65 +/- 0.14 microM/g wet wt). Alanine was found to originate from pyruvate and was a glycolytic end product in glucose-perfused hearts. INO raised the [3-13C]alanine/[3-13C]lactate ratio in ischemic, intact hearts (glucose = 0.24 +/- 0.07 versus glucose+INO = 0.60 +/- 0.09; pyruvate = 0.49 +/- 0.08 versus pyruvate+INO = 0.89 +/- 0.08). At 7 minutes of ischemia, ATP content fell to 70 +/- 3% with glucose+INO versus 58 +/- 5% with glucose alone. Rigor (stone heart) was delayed from 14.7 +/- 1.3 to 23.2 +/- 1.6 minutes with INO. INO did not change ATP content in ischemic hearts that were supplied pyruvate but delayed rigor (pyruvate = 9.9 +/- 1.2 minutes; pyruvate+INO = 15.6 +/- 1.0 minutes), possibly at the expense of glycogen. Supplemental glucose improved the effectiveness of INO with pyruvate to preserve ATP (pyruvate+glucose = 42 +/- 6%; pyruvate+glucose+INO = 72 +/- 6%) and further delayed rigor (pyruvate+glucose = 13.3 +/- 1.5 minutes; pyruvate+glucose+INO = 20.3 +/- 1.8 minutes). Glucose metabolism supported improved energetic and contractile states in ischemic hearts treated with INO. Thus, cardioprotection of the ischemic heart by INO was associated with preservation of functional integrity and improved energy production due to increased glycolytic activity. Activation of glycolysis in the presence of INO was accommodated by augmented alanine production without the additional accumulation of lactate. 
1	Cystic adenoma of the pigmented ciliary epithelium. Clinical, pathologic, and immunohistopathologic findings. A 51-year-old white man was found to have a deeply pigmented mass in the ciliary body and peripheral choroid of his right eye with an associated vitreous hemorrhage. Although the tumor appeared to be a ciliochoroidal melanoma, a melanocytoma and adenoma of the pigment epithelium also were considered in the differential diagnosis. The tumor was removed by a large partial lamellar sclerocyclochoroidectomy. Results of histopathologic evaluation showed a cystic adenoma of the pigmented ciliary epithelium. To the authors' knowledge, this was the first immunohistopathologic study of this tumor. Results of the study showed marked immunoreactivity for low molecular weight cytokeratins, vimentin, and S-100 protein. These immunohistochemical studies are consistent with the origin of this tumor from pigment epithelial cells. 
2	Treatment of severe colitis in Behcet's syndrome with thalidomide (CG-217). A 35-year-old male patient, known in our department since 1979 on account of a severe and complete Behcet's syndrome, was treated with thalidomide (CG-217) as a final pharmacological measure to avoid colectomy during a severe attack of Behcet colitis. Prior to the administration of thalidomide, the patient had been treated for 7 weeks with full parenteral nutrition and high doses of steroids intravenously without a satisfactory effect on the colitis. Treatment with sulphasalazin was unsuccessful because of a decreasing number of platelets on this drug. After a few days on thalidomide, 300 mg given once daily at bedtime, the patient's stools were normalized and without reaction for blood, his oral ulcers and pleural effusion disappeared, and his steroid doses could be reduced. Gradually he was put on oral nutrition again, and his rectal mucosa became normalized. The dose of thalidomide was reduced to 200 mg, and then to 100 mg daily when the patient was discharged from hospital, less than 3 weeks after institution of the drug treatment. After 5 months as an out-patient his condition is still satisfactory and without symptoms of his former disease. Thalidomide has previously been reported to be of value in treatment of Behcet's syndrome, but to my knowledge never with such a dramatic effect on a severe colitis as reported in this case. 
2	Intussusception encephalopathy: an underrecognized cause of coma in children. Intestinal intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in infancy and early childhood. Typically the presenting signs and symptoms are referable to the abdomen. On occasion the most prominent presenting feature is depressed level of consciousness. We describe 3 patients who presented with coma associated with intussusception. 
3	Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels in men with premature coronary artery disease. Plasma homocyst(e)ine (that is, the sum of free and bound homocysteine and its oxidized forms, homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide) levels were determined in 170 men (mean age +/- SD 50 +/- 7 years) with premature coronary artery disease diagnosed at coronary angiography and in 255 control subjects clinically free of coronary artery disease (mean age 49 +/- 6 years). Patients with coronary artery disease had a higher homocyst(e)ine level than control subjects (13.66 +/- 6.44 versus 10.93 +/- 4.92 nmol/ml, p less than 0.001). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower (32 +/- 10 versus 46 +/- 13 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides levels were higher (193 +/- 103 versus 136 +/- 106 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) in the coronary disease group. Plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were not significantly different between patients with coronary disease and control subjects. The presence of hypertension, smoking or diabetes mellitus did not significantly alter homocyst(e)ine levels in the patient or the control group. Patients who were not taking a beta-adrenergic blocking drug (n = 70) had a nonsignificantly higher homocyst(e)ine level than did patients taking this class of drugs (n = 100) (14.67 +/- 8.92 versus 12.95 +/- 3.77 nmol/ml, p = 0.087). By design, none of the control subjects were taking a beta-blocker. No significant correlations were observed between homocyst(e)ine and age, serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It is concluded that an elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine level is an independent risk factor for the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis in men. 
1	Atrial fibrillation with cardiac tamponade as the initial manifestation of malignant pericarditis This article describes the case of a 72-year-old woman with cardiac tamponade and atrial fibrillation as the initial manifestation of a lymphoid malignancy. The pathogenesis of cardiac tamponade, various diagnostic modalities, and therapy of this condition are reviewed. 
3	Optic nerve gliomas and meningiomas. Optic nerve gliomas are benign astrocytic neoplasms that primarily affect children. The ultimate prognosis for vision is poor. For lesions confined to the optic nerves, long-term survival is excellent, but with involvement of the chiasm and especially of the hypothalamus or third ventricle, prognosis falls significantly. For this group, no form of therapy has proven to be of any benefit. Optic sheath meningiomas are neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap cells. They primarily affect middle-aged adults. Like gliomas, the prognosis for vision is poor, but unlike gliomas, prognosis for life is excellent. 
5	Munchausen syndrome by proxy documented by discrepant blood typing. The authors describe a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of child abuse, documented by use of routine blood bank serologic procedures. While immunohematologic testing has been used in the legal arena to resolve issues of disputed paternity and to investigate instances of criminal acts, the authors believe this to be the first documented application to this clinical disorder. 
3	Limitations of electroencephalographic monitoring in the detection of cerebral ischemia accompanying carotid endarterectomy. An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy. 
1	Obstructing carcinoma of the cecum. Carcinoma of the cecum, the third most common location for malignancy of the large bowel, was examined with attention centered upon cecal cancers producing obstruction. Reviewing 136 patients revealed 11 obstructing lesions (8.1%) presenting as distal small bowel obstructions. The mean age of the patients was 74 years. All but one patient had resection for cure which consisted of a right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse colostomy. There was no operative mortality or significant morbidity. Bowel obstruction due to cecal carcinoma is an infrequent occurrence arising in elderly patients and carries a poor survival rate due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and treatment. 
4	Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Surgical alternatives depending of the age of the patient. Four cases of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, three of which were operated upon in our Centre, are presented. An aortocoronary bypass with reversed autologous saphenous vein was carried out in both of the children; and in the adult, the anomalous ostium was closed from the interior of the pulmonary artery. After 84, 72, and 4 months of evolution, respectively, they were found to be asymptomatic, the mitral insufficiency had disappeared and the venous graft remained patent. In this paper, the clinical form of presentation, diagnostic possibilities and surgical treatment are analysed. 
5	Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. A study was made with intra-operative flash--visual evoked potentials (VEP) monitored using a fibre-optic/contact lens photo stimulator in 57 patients undergoing intra-orbital surgical procedures with potential risk to the optic nerve. The VEPs recorded under enflurane and nitrous oxide anaesthesia did not differ significantly in latency or amplitude from the pre-operative recordings. Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision. The technique provides early warning to the surgeon of threats to the integrity of the optic nerve. 
1	Intraoperative I-125 seed implantation for extensive recurrent head and neck carcinomas. From 1978 to 1988, 41 patients with extensive recurrent carcinomas of the head and neck were treated with surgical resection plus intraoperative iodine-125 seed implantation. Surgery was performed to resect the tumors and to expose the tumor beds for implantation. I-125 seeds were implanted intraoperatively, with a spacing of 0.75-1 cm between adjacent seeds, either into the soft tissue in the tumor bed or onto small patches of gelatin sponges to cover the bone, nerve, or blood vessel involved with disease. Reconstructive flaps were used in 18 patients. The average I-125 dose delivered by the implanted seeds was 8,263 cGy. The determinate 5-year actuarial survival rate for the entire group was 40%. The 5-year local disease control rate was 44%. Major complications were transient wound infection (32%), flap necrosis (24%), fistula formation (10%), and carotid blowout (5%). These results indicate that surgical resection plus I-125 seed implantation provides a potentially curative treatment for patients with extensive recurrent head and neck carcinomas that would be considered traditionally unresectable and that would be treated only with palliative therapy. 
5	Meningitis in the neurosurgical patient. In the patient with a basilar skull fracture and CSF leak, the risk of meningitis is greatly increased. The diagnosis of both leak and infection can be obscured by the patient's other injuries, and requires aggressive investigation of symptoms that suggest infection. Although the diagnosis is made with CSF cultures, when clinically suspected, treatment should begin after appropriate cultures have been obtained. Treatment should be directed against the most likely organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and the other organisms common to the upper respiratory tract. There are no good indications for prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with known CSF leaks. The patient with a shunt or other CNS prosthetic device may have various manifestations of infection, depending on the type of device and its termination. Frank meningitis or ventriculitis is not always present. Diagnosis requires direct culturing of the shunt milieu, with the most frequent isolates being staphylococcal species and gram-negative enteric bacilli. The most effective therapy, for both eradication of the infection and minimization of the duration and morbidity of therapy, involves removal of the infected shunt, external drainage during parenteral antibiotic therapy, and complete replacement of hardware at the time of internalization. The postsurgical patient will not develop meningitis very frequently, but like the posttrauma patient, concurrent factors can make the diagnosis difficult. Differentiating infectious from chemical meningitis must often be initially based on CSF cell counts and chemistries alone. Treatment to cover the most likely organism, staphylococcal species and respiratory flora, should be started before the culture results are finalized. 
3	Temporoparietal cortex in aphasia. Evidence from positron emission tomography. Forty-four aphasic patients were examined with (F18)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in a resting state to determine whether consistent glucose metabolic abnormalities were present. Ninety-seven percent of subjects showed metabolic abnormalities in the angular gyrus, 89% in the supramarginal gyrus, and 87% in the lateral and transverse superior temporal gyrus. Pearson product moment correlations were calculated between regional metabolic measures and performance on the Western Aphasia Battery. No significant correlations were found between the Western Aphasia Battery scores and right hemisphere metabolic measures. Most left hemisphere regions correlated with more than one score from the Western Aphasia Battery. Temporal but not frontal regions had significant correlations to the comprehension score. The left temporoparietal region was consistently affected in these subjects, suggesting that common features in the aphasias were caused by left temporoparietal dysfunction, while behavioral differences resulted from (1) the extent of temporoparietal changes, and (2) dysfunction elsewhere in the brain, particularly the left frontal and subcortical areas. 
4	Plastic bullet arterial embolization following gunshot injury to the heart. Case report and review of the literature. A plastic bullet penetrating the heart through the right ventricle embolized to the right profunda. Suture of the heart and extraction of the bullet resulted in uneventful recovery. The literature revealed 21 instances of embolization following proven heart penetration, in two cases through the right ventricle. 
4	Increased platelet membrane sodium-proton exchange rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It has been proposed that increased Na-H exchange activity is involved in the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension. We studied platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and domestic Wistar rats (DWR), since platelets have similarities to smooth muscle cells and have been shown to have potentially related ion metabolism abnormalities, such as increased intracellular calcium activity. We determined the exchange rate by the intracellular acidification-dependent, extracellular sodium-dependent volume increase. The rate of increase during the first 3 min is linear and is shown to be higher in SHR (0.475 X min-1) than in WKY (0.410 X min-1) or DWR (0.389 X min-1). We conclude that the Na-H activity is increased in platelets of SHR. Similar findings in lymphocytes and neutrophils of SHR, and analogous findings in platelets of humans with essential hypertension, suggest that this abnormality is expressed by several cell types, some of which may be involved in the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension in both rats and humans. 
1	Diagnosis of corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors causing Cushing's syndrome Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin) has been recognized for many years. Traditionally, clinicians have thought that most cases were due to lung carcinomas and that the clinical manifestations differed from those for pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. We report two cases of corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors that were clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Review of the literature revealed that bronchial carcinoid tumors are the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic secretion of corticotropin. On biochemical and anatomic studies, they are frequently indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome and thus may be difficult to diagnose. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling for corticotropin and computerized imaging of the chest may be the best aids in making the diagnosis. 
1	Healing of a large nonossifying fibroma after grafting with bone matrix and marrow. A case report. Healing of a large tibial nonossifying fibroma in a 12-year-old girl occurred following excision, curettage, and filling of the bony defect with human demineralized bone matrix powder mixed with a small quantity of the patient's bone marrow. The use of this graft composite was successful in the treatment of the lesion and reduced the potential risk and morbidity associated with pediatric orthopedic surgical procedures with autogeneic iliac crest and other bone grafts. 
5	Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. 
4	New quantitative method for evaluating tricuspid regurgitation. A new quantitative method for evaluating regurgitation (TR) is proposed in order to select the most suitable treatment for functional TR associated with acquired valvular heart disease. The regurgitant volume per beat (VTR) is calculated using two-dimensional color Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographies. In a study of 48 patients, preoperative VTR showed a significant correlation with tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole, right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to preoperative VTR: Group I, VTR less than 10 cc (no. 18); Group II, VTR = 10-20 cc (no. 18); Group III, VTR greater than or equal to 20 cc (no. 12). This classification correlated well with the intraoperative findings of TR. In all Group I patients, VTR decreased without any tricuspid valve repair. In Group II, 17 of 18 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty, and showed a decrease in VTR to below 10 cc after surgery. In Group III, 10 underwent tricuspid annuloplasty and 2 tricuspid valve replacement. Three of the 10 with tricuspid annuloplasty showed a significant degree of postoperative VTR (10-20 cc). These 3 patients as well as the 2 with tricuspid valve replacement showed a preoperative peak-to-peak pressure difference across the tricuspid valve during the ejection phase (RVsp-TAv) of less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole of greater than or equal to 50 mm. In conclusion, no tricuspid valve repair was required in Group I (TR I). For group II (TR II) patients, tricuspid annuloplasty was necessary and adequate for TR correction. For Group II (TR III) patients, a more substantial procedure like tricuspid valve replacement should be performed, especially when the preoperative RVsp-RAv is less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole is greater than or equal to 50 mm. 
3	Unilateral asterixis. We describe three patients with unilateral asterixis. One diabetic patient with a moderately-sized haematoma in the left putamen initially developed bilateral and symmetrical asterixis, which became confined to the right side as his diabetes mellitus was controlled. Two patients showed unilateral asterixis due to haematomas in the contralateral basal ganglia and thalamus, respectively. The present findings indicate that not only lesions of the thalamus but also those of the basal ganglia can cause unilateral asterixis, and bilateral and symmetrical asterixis does not necessarily exclude the presence of a focal mass lesion in the cerebrum. 
1	Antisecretory and antilesional effect of a new histamine H2-receptor antagonist, IT-066, in rats. The effects of a new histamine H2-receptor antagonist, IT-066 (3-amino-4-[4-[4-(1-piperidinomethyl)-2-pyridyloxy]-cis-2-++ +butenylamino]- 3-cyclobutene-1,2-dione hydrochloride), were investigated on the secretagogue-induced acid secretion in vivo and in vitro, and on experimental gastric and duodenal lesion in rats. IT-066 (10-60 micrograms/kg) given i.v. inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently in gastric lumen-perfused rats, and the inhibitory effect was observed for about 12 hr. Famotidine (FMD) (10-60 micrograms/kg i.v.) also had an antisecretory effect, but the acid secretion recovered to the control level 4 hr after the administration. Cold stress plus indomethacin-induced lesion was significantly inhibited by IT-066 and FMD given i.v. 30 min before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment. IT-066 given 7 hr before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment also inhibited lesion formation significantly, but such antilesional effect was not observed with FMD. In the rat isolated gastric mucosal sheet, IT-066 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently and noncompetitively; its action was produced via a unique mechanism. The inhibitory effect of IT-066 remained after washing of the mucosa, and became more potent time-dependently. The inhibitory effects of FMD and cimetidine were not observed after washing the mucosa. These data suggest that IT-066 has a potent and long lasting antisecretory effect in vivo and in vitro, and that these properties are responsible for the long lasting antilesional action. 
4	Congestive heart failure: a current overview. Congestive heart failure (CHF), a disease seen primarily in the older patient, can be due to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Management is quite different if the heart failure is due to a filling abnormality as compared to poor ventricular systole. The disorder also poses many diagnostic pitfalls in the elderly. Current understanding of CHF and its influence on diagnosis and management is the focus of this review. 
5	Intravenous diclofenac sodium. Does its administration before operation suppress postoperative pain? Intravenous diclofenac sodium was evaluated in a double-blind randomised trial relative to intramuscular diclofenac, intravenous fentanyl, and intramuscular placebo in 160 patients undergoing extraction of impacted lower third molar teeth. The test drug was administered before operation in an attempt to alleviate postoperative pain. A 10-cm visual analogue scale was used to assess pain at 30 minutes and one day after surgery, if the patients stayed overnight. Patients who received intravenous diclofenac had significantly less pain than the other groups 30 minutes after operation. They also had significantly less pain one day after surgery than the placebo or opioid groups, but not less than the intramuscular diclofenac group. Capillary bleeding time, in comparison with placebo, was significantly prolonged after the use of intramuscular diclofenac, and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the intravenous diclofenac group. No problems were encountered with excessive bleeding in any group. 
2	Impaired pressor reactivity in cirrhosis: evidence for a peripheral vascular defect. The blood pressure responses to intravenous infusions of norepinephrine and angiotensin II, sympathetic and nonsympathetic vasoconstricting agents, respectively, were measured in 20 patients with cirrhosis (10 Child-Pugh grade A and 10 Child-Pugh grades B or C) and in 20 healthy subjects. The log PD20 (dose of agonist required to raise blood pressure by 20 mm Hg) for norepinephrine was 4.78 +/- 0.36 (mean +/- S.D.) in patients with severe cirrhosis and 4.36 +/- 0.37 in controls, p less than 0.01. Log PD20 for angiotensin II was 3.16 +/- 1.06 in patients with severe cirrhosis and 1.97 +/- 0.74 in controls, p less than 0.01. Cardiovascular responses to selective sympathetic agonists were measured in 10 other cirrhotic patients (all Child-Pugh grades B or C) and in 10 healthy controls. Log PD20s for phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, and for alphamethylnorepinephrine; an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were increased in cirrhosis (phenylephrine = 5.35 +/- 0.49 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.35, p less than 0.05; alphamethylnorepinephrine = 4.05 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.44 +/- 0.55, p less than 0.001). In contrast, log CD20 (dose of agonist required to raise the heart rate by 20 beats/min) for isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls (2.81 +/- 0.38 vs. 2.94 +/- 0.45, p = 0.49). These studies demonstrate that pressor reactivity to both sympathetic and nonsympathetic agonists is impaired in severe cirrhosis, that the impaired sympathetic responses are not caused by generalized sympathetic desensitization and that the site common to the four agonists with impaired responses is the peripheral vascular smooth muscle. 
5	Stiffman syndrome: a rare paraneoplastic disorder? An unusual case of the stiffman syndrome, associated with an oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus, is reported. Pathological examination showed that it was due to an encephalomyelitis similar to that seen in paraneoplastic disorders. This suggests that atypical cases of the stiffman syndrome may occasionally be paraneoplastic. 
5	Theophylline minimally alters contractile properties of canine diaphragm in vitro. We examined the effects of theophylline on contractile properties and high-frequency fatigue of canine diaphragm in vitro. Eighteen diaphragm muscle bundles were obtained from 10 anesthetized dogs and equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution to 100, 200, or 300 mg/l theophylline. These bundles were compared with 18 matched control bundles from the contralateral hemidiaphragm. No statistically significant differences in twitch tension, tetanic tension, twitch-to-tetanus ratio, time to peak tension, or half-relaxation time were observed. Concentrations of 300 mg/l theophylline, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased force production at 10 Hz by 32%. A similar tendency was present at lower concentrations and exhibited a clear dose-response behavior. High-frequency fatigue was similar in control and theophylline-treated bundles. We conclude that supratherapeutic in vitro concentrations of theophylline do not increase maximal tetanic tension and do not protect against muscle fatigue but potentiate relative force production at low stimulation frequencies. This relatively small effect cannot be explained by poor diffusion of the drug in the muscle bundle, because theophylline concentrations in the muscle bath and in the muscle bundle were virtually identical. Moreover, it remains unclear whether this potentially beneficial effect can be achieved at in vivo attainable serum concentrations. 
4	Characteristics of participants at baseline in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS). The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial currently being conducted to compare the effects of nonpharmacologic therapy alone with those of 1 of 5 active drug regimens combined with nonpharmacologic therapy, for long-term management of patients with mild hypertension. Six classes of drugs were studied: (1) acebutolol (beta blocker), (2) amlodipine (calcium antagonist), (3) chlorthalidone (diuretic), (4) doxazosin (alpha 1 antagonist), (5) enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and (6) placebo. All participants received nutritional-hygienic advice to reduce weight and sodium and alcohol intakes and to increase physical activity. End points include blood pressure change, side effects and quality-of-life indices; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death, among participants receiving drugs as first-step treatment as well as nonpharmacologic treatment compared with incidence among those participants randomized to nonpharmacologic treatment only as the initial step. 
5	Recurrent rhabdomyolysis in association with cocaine use. As the popularity of cocaine increases in our society, so does the frequency and variety of medical complications associated with its use. A growing number of cases have implicated cocaine use in the development of rhabdomyolysis and its complication, acute renal failure. We have reported the first case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure directly associated with cocaine use. Although adulterants might cause muscle damage, we believe cocaine should be added to the list of drugs that are capable of producing rhabdomyolysis. 
4	Acute limb ischaemia: the place of intravenous streptokinase. Intravenous streptokinase infusions (100,000 units/h) have been used to treat 48 patients, with 50 episodes of acute limb ischaemia who were unlikely to benefit from a surgical approach. These included 17 acute thromboses, 14 late or distal emboli and 19 bypass graft occlusions. Overall, 17 (34 per cent) instances had complete lysis with reappearance of distal pulses and a further 28 per cent had clinical improvement without change in pulse status. Final outcome after 30 days was limb salvage in 60 per cent, amputation in 24 per cent and death in 16 per cent, but this was achieved after eight patients without lysis had vascular reconstructive surgery. Serious complications were infrequent, but included a fatal stroke, a haematemesis and two episodes of distal embolization. The outcome was not related to the duration of ischaemia or the site of occlusion. Lysis was more frequent with emboli (50 per cent) and graft occlusions (47 per cent) than arterial thromboses (6 per cent). Limb salvage was more likely in patients with no neurological deficit in the limb (70 per cent) than if a deficit was present (37 per cent). In conclusion, intravenous streptokinase produced a moderate benefit with low morbidity and has a role in acute limb ischaemia if surgery is inappropriate and intra-arterial lysis unavailable. In particular, selected patients with emboli or graft occlusions without a neurological deficit may be most suitable. 
3	Health care screening for people with mental handicap living in the community OBJECTIVE--To determine what contact people with mental handicap had had with their general practitioner in the previous year; what prescribed drugs they were taking and whether these had been reviewed; when hearing and vision had last been screened; and what medical problems were found on examination. DESIGN--Case series. SETTING-Day centre for adults with mental handicap. SUBJECTS--A balanced sample of 75 of the 150 people attending the day centre. 10 Were excluded because consent was not given. RESULTS--The subjects did not consult their general practitioners more frequently than the general population but were more likely to be taking prescribed drugs, and 57% of these prescriptions had not been reviewed by a doctor. Thirty three people failed vision screening, including 13 who wore glasses. Twenty seven of the 62 who were testable had a hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS--As only eight out of 65 people examined in the study did not have an appreciable problem brought to light, screening seems to be worth while. Whether such screening needs to be done by a medically qualified person needs further research. 
2	Parathyroid hormone and cirrhosis of the liver. Fifty patients with liver cirrhosis (36 alcoholic, 1 drug-induced, 7 posthepatitic, and 6 cryptogenic) and normal renal function were investigated to determine whether PTH levels in serum, measured using the common midregion human PTH-(44-68) RIA, are elevated in such patients and whether this is related to impaired liver function rather than to the effect of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Their data were compared with those from 25 control subjects. The median PTH level of 462 +/- 18 ng/L (+/- SEM) was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in cirrhotics compared with that of 236 +/- 13 ng/L in the control group. Significant correlations were found between PTH levels and parameters of liver function such as prothrombin time (r = -0.40; P less than 0.01), albumin as a percentage of total protein (r = -0.48; P less than 0.01), bilirubin (r = 0.35; P less than 0.05), albumin (r = -0.34; p less than 0.05), and cholesterol (r = -0.32; P less than 0.05), but not for antipyrine clearance, suggesting increasing PTH with decreasing liver function. The median calcium level (2.26 +/- 0.03 mmol/L), corrected for changes in albumin, was near the lower limit of the normal range (2.25-2.60), but corrected calcium and PTH were positively correlated (r = 0.33; P less than 0.05), indicating that the elevation is not reactive to calcium depletion. A negative correlation existed between PTH and 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol (r = -0.49; P less than 0.05), the main circulating metabolite of vitamin D. Normal values in an immunoradiometric assay that detects the whole sequence of human PTH-(1-84) suggest that fragments rather than the intact hormone are responsible for PTH elevations in cirrhosis. The positive correlation between midregion PTH and corrected calcium is probably an artifact of the correction formula. In conclusion, midregion PTH fragments are increased in patients with liver cirrhosis. The reason for this elevation may well be the impaired liver function rather than secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
5	What getting sick means. The concepts of health, disease and death have intrigued man since the beginning of time and are continually evolving. In the nonwestern societies the models which have been proposed for the etiology of disease have a dichotomous view of disease causation which is derived from either natural or supernatural forces. In the Western societies these concepts are well defined. The numerous advances in the fields of genetics and molecular biology have added a new dimension to the understanding of the various factors involved in the pathogenesis of disease processes. These advances have allowed a greater understanding of numerous disease processes including the inborn errors of metabolism, endocrine disorders and human neoplasia. Several recent advances in the areas of molecular biology and physiology allowing this increased understanding of human disease are presented. 
3	Use of EMLA cream as an analgesic in the management of painful otitis externa. A new application of EMLA cream is described. Relief of pain in otitis externa is difficult and systemic analgesics for this localized condition are often ineffective. Meticulous cleaning of the external auditory meatus is an essential step in the treatment. EMLA cream is an effective analgesic which can be used to relieve pain and anaesthetize the external auditory meatus to allow cleaning in patients with intact tympanic membranes. 
3	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. We describe 10 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who did not have papilledema. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, although rarely reported, may well be a clinically important headache syndrome. Historical and demographic features of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema are similar to those of patients with papilledema. Obese women with chronic daily headache and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, pulsatile tinnitus, history of head trauma or meningitis, an empty sella on imaging studies, or a headache that is unrelieved by standard therapy should have a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Findings from laboratory and neurologic investigations are normal in most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. Initial management should include removal of possible inciting agents, weight loss if applicable, and standard headache therapy. Lumbar puncture and diuretic therapy should precede a trial of corticosteroids. Surgery (lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt or perhaps optic nerve sheath fenestration) may be indicated for prolonged incapacitating headache that is not responsive to medical management or lumbar puncture. 
5	Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. 
5	Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation. 
5	Percutaneous pedestal in cochlear implantation. Direct electrical connection between an external sound-processing device and intracochlear electrodes is accomplished via a percutaneous pedestal. Patient pedestal complaints and experience have been recorded. Pedestal problems have been classified into six classes, with class 0 indicating no problems and the severity of problem increasing in classes 1 through 4. Class 5 indicates pedestal trauma. No class 5 problems were encountered. At 48 months of experience, 53% of patients were class 0 and 26% were class 1. The pedestal experience is detailed in the paper. The percutaneous pedestal has been found to be a well-tolerated, efficient system for information transfer in cochlear implant patients. 
1	Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. An adequate proximal surgical margin is difficult to determine particularly in cases of esophageal carcinoma with surrounding intraepithelial invasion. We report here readily facilitated intraoperative approaches for detection of the exact margin of carcinomatous invasion of the esophagus. The resected specimen of the esophagus is incised longitudinally and placed in a 1% Lugol bath for 2-3 minutes. The normal squamous epithelium includes glycogen that interacts with the iodine of Lugol's solution and the normal epithelium of the esophagus becomes a uniform greenish-brown. A squamous cell carcinoma does not include glycogen, hence is not stained with this solution and a clear identification is feasible. Thus, a carcinomatous infiltration not recognizable in routine examinations becomes macroscopically visible when Lugol's solution is used. 
4	Extraperitoneal endarterectomy for iliofemoral occlusive disease. Sixty patients with iliofemoral occlusive disease were treated by autogenous anatomic reconstruction by endarterectomy. Endarterectomy was performed extra-peritoneally by the eversion technique. The operative technique and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Six patients had postoperative complications of acute anastomotic hemorrhage (two patients), would hematoma (two patients), and atelectasis (two patients). Sixty patients discharged with patient arterial reconstruction were followed up from 5 months to 17 1/2 years, with a mean follow-up of 53 months. There were no other vascular complications. Seventy limbs were at risk during this period, with an accumulative patency rate of 80.4% at 5 years and 71.4% at 10 years. There were 11 occlusions of the external iliac artery and one stenosis of the common femoral artery. Failures occurred mainly in the external iliac artery, which appears to be the limiting factor in the continued patency of endarterectomy. There were 18 deaths (30%). Nine deaths were attributed to the complications of arteriosclerosis. 
4	Pathogenesis of hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension. Evidence of disordered venous innervation exclusively in the lower limbs. The pathogenesis of hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension was studied in eight patients. Correction of the abnormal orthostatic changes by an inflated pressure suit (MAST) confirmed previous evidence of excessive gravitational pooling of blood in the leg veins. Intravenous L-norepinephrine infusion raised diastolic blood pressure in the same relationship to the infusion-induced increments in plasma norepinephrine concentrations as in normal subjects, indicating normal arteriolar responses. Contractile responses of the veins to infused L-norepinephrine were measured with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The venous responses of hand veins in the patients fell within the 95% confidence limits of the responses of normal hand veins, as did the responses of foot veins in the seven normal subjects. However, foot veins of the patients with hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension, and both hand and foot veins of patients with "diffuse" autonomic failure, were supersensitive to norepinephrine, as reflected by a steeper slope of the regression of log (norepinephrine infusion rate) on percentage reduction in venous distensibility, and a significantly lower ED50 (i.e., norepinephrine infusion rate that induced 50% reduction in venous distensibility). The findings suggest anatomical or functional postganglionic denervation of lower limb veins causing excessive gravitational blood pooling with consequent orthostatic hypotension in these patients. 
2	Incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a prospective study. To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg. 
5	Cytogenetic damage induced by folate deficiency in mice is enhanced by caffeine. Folate deficiency in Swiss mice increased the incidence of micronuclei in peripheral blood erythrocytes, indicating increased chromosomal damage in nucleated erythrocyte precursors. Caffeine enhanced the incidence of micronuclei in blood and bone marrow by up to 5-fold in folate-deficient mice at doses that did not significantly alter the micronucleus frequency in the presence of adequate dietary folate. The lower dose of caffeine used in this study (75 mg/kg) approaches doses received by humans who consume large amounts of caffeinated beverages. Since folate deficiency and caffeine consumption are highly prevalent in the human population, the potential for a similar interaction in man should be evaluated. 
1	Cholecystokinin stimulates growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma SW-1990. The effect of a synthetic analogue of CCK (Thr4,Nle7CCK-9) on growth of SW-1990 human pancreatic cancer was examined in two experimental models. Nude mice bearing SW-1990 pancreatic cancer xenografts were injected with CCK (5, 15, or 25 micrograms/kg) or vehicle twice daily for 20 days. Animals were then sacrificed and tumor volume, weight, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content were evaluated. SW-1990 cells were grown in vitro and the effects of CCK, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and proglumide (a CCK-receptor antagonist) on cell number and DNA synthesis were determined. The highest dose of CCK, 25 micrograms/kg, significantly increased tumor weight, protein content, and DNA content (P less than 0.005). In vitro, CCK caused significant increases in cell counts of up to 47% at six days and 66% at 12 days compared to control. Graded concentrations of CCK had a biphasic effect on DNA synthesis with significant increases of up to 65% (P less than 0.005). CCK-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by proglumide. Secretin slightly increased cancer cell growth, although not as potently as CCK, VIP or secretin in combination with CCK did not show potentiation. These results indicate that growth of some human pancreatic cancers may be influenced by gastrointestinal peptides, of which CCK is the most potent. 
2	Acute deterioration of renal function associated with enteric hyperoxaluria. Enteric hyperoxaluria due to malabsorption syndromes has been well documented to cause renal calculi and chronic tubulointerstitial renal damage. Rarely, in the setting of intestinal bypass operations for morbid obesity, enteric hyperoxaluria has produced acute renal failure. We report two patients who suffered acute deterioration of renal function associated with increased intestinal absorption and renal excretion of oxalate associated with steatorrhea. One patient had a large portion of his small bowel resected many years prior to the onset of the renal failure and the second patient had chronic pancreatitis causing steatorrhea. Both patients had renal biopsy documentation of the acute nature of the tubular damage produced by oxalate deposition. The mechanisms of their deterioration of renal function may relate to sudden increases in steatorrhea in association with episodes of volume depletion. Enteric hyperoxaluria may be an easily overlooked and potentially preventable etiology of acute renal dysfunction. 
5	Chronic pain. Understanding of the etiology of chronic pain is growing rapidly as researchers seek to integrate physiologic and psychosocial mechanisms. When nurses assess clients with chronic pain, they should make their assessments using both verbal and nonverbal methods and realize that no one instrument is comprehensive enough to be used alone. The key to successful treatment of these difficult clients lies in the use of a comprehensive approach that takes the client seriously and integrates both physiologic and psychosocial approaches. 
4	Systemic to pulmonary bronchial blood flow in mitral stenosis. We measured systemic to pulmonary bronchial blood flow [Qbr(s-p)] during total cardiopulmonary bypass in 15 patients with mitral stenosis and elevated pulmonary venous pressure (group A, mean pulmonary wedge pressure = 22.2 +/- 5.4 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) and in 15 patients with coronary artery diseases and normal pulmonary venous pressure (group B). Qbr(s-p) is the volume of blood accumulating in the left side of the heart in the absence of pulmonary and coronary flows. This blood was vented through a cannula introduced into the left atrium and measured. Qbr(s-p) was 76.3 +/- 13.9 ml/min (2.18 +/- 0.37 percent of extracorporeal circulation pump flow) and 22.3 +/- 2.1 (0.63 +/- 0.15) in group A and B, respectively (p less than 0.01). During total cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary venous pressure is approximately atmospheric pressure, and no differences in systemic blood pressure, extracorporeal circulation pump flow, and airways pressure were observed between group A and B. Therefore, vascular resistance through the bronchial vessels draining into the pulmonary circulation is reduced in patients with mitral stenosis and elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
2	Intrapartum uterine rupture and inflammatory bowel disease. The incidence of uterine rupture in pregnant women ranges from 0% to 1.1% in large series. This case report describes a woman with a history of obstetric complications, uterine rupture, and active inflammatory bowel disease that was treated with high-dose prednisone. 
5	Uniparental paternal disomy in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin. 
5	Transbronchial biopsies in children after heart-lung transplantation. Sixty transbronchial biopsies have been performed in eight children after heart-lung transplantation. The selection of fiber-optic bronchoscope or a small (4 mm; 30 cm) rigid bronchoscope was made according to the size of endotracheal tube required at surgery. If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used. For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults). The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection. Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia. As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter. 
2	Prediction of outcome in acute pancreatitis: a comparative study of APACHE II, clinical assessment and multiple factor scoring systems. The APACHE II severity of disease classification system has been examined prospectively in 160 patients with acute pancreatitis. Using clinical and simple laboratory data APACHE II was able to provide useful discrimination between uncomplicated, complicated and fatal attacks within a few hours of admission. Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy. 
4	Local hypothermia to prolong safe tourniquet time. Local hypothermia was studied as a method to safely prolong tourniquet time for reconstructive procedures of the upper extremity. An ice blanket constructed of flannel cloth and cold gel packs was applied to the limb for 45 minutes preoperatively. Seventy-eight patients were evaluated for complications resulting from hypothermia and prolonged tourniquet application. The duration of continuous tourniquet ischemia averaged two hours and 25 minutes. Intraoperative muscle temperature recordings indicated that the iced limbs were an average of 12.9 degrees cooler than noniced limbs before tourniquet inflation. Electron microscopic studies of biopsied muscle showed no evidence of ischemic changes. There were no postoperative complications associated with prolonged tourniquet inflation or the hypothermia blanket technique. Local hypothermia appears to be a safe and effective method of decreasing the adverse effects of tourniquet ischemia and allowing continuous tourniquet inflation time to extend safely beyond the customary two-hour limit. 
4	Diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Effect on active force generation during systole. We tested the hypothesis that intracellular Ca++ [( Ca++]i) overload underlies the diastolic dysfunction of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial tissue was obtained at the time of surgery or transplantation from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and was compared with control myocardium obtained from patients without heart disease. The isometric contractions and electrophysiologic properties of all myocardial specimens were recorded by standard techniques and [Ca++]i was measured with the bioluminescent calcium indicator aequorin. In contrast to the controls, action potentials, Ca++ transients, and isometric contraction and relaxation were markedly prolonged in the hypertrophic myocardium, and the Ca++ transients consisted of two distinct components. At 38 degrees C and 1 Hz pacing frequency, a state of relative Ca++ overload appeared develop, which produced a rise in end-diastolic [Ca++]i, incomplete relaxation, and fusion of twitches with a resultant decrease in active tension development. We also found that drugs with increase [Ca++]i, such as digitalis, exacerbated these abnormalities, whereas drugs that lower [Ca++]i, such as verapamil, or agents that increase cyclic AMP, such as forskolin, prevented them. These results may explain why patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate tachycardia poorly, and may have important implications with regard to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
4	Doppler echocardiographic study of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves in the aortic valve position in patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction. To study the natural history of the hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic heart valves, Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in a group of clinically stable patients at 2 and 5 years after replacement of native aortic valves with bioprosthetic valves. Eighteen patients completed a 2-year and 26 patients a 5-year follow-up examination. The effective orifice areas of identical models of bioprosthetic valves (Hancock II) were determined in vitro in a left-sided heart pulse duplicator system. In vivo Doppler-derived effective orifice areas were compared with the in vitro measurements for the same valve size. At both the 2- and 5-year follow-up examinations, the Doppler-derived effective orifice area was significantly less than the in vitro area (p less than 0.0001 at each interval). Ten of 16 valves evaluated serially decreased greater than 0.20 cm2 in the Doppler-derived effective orifice area between studies. The mean decrease in effective orifice area in valves evaluated serially was 0.25 +/- 0.29 cm2 (p less than 0.005). The peak transaortic gradient increased from 21 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The mean transaortic gradient increased from 12 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that serial Doppler echocardiographic studies demonstrate a deterioration in the hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic valves over time in patients with no symptoms or signs of valvular dysfunction and that Doppler echocardiography may be useful for identifying subclinical bioprosthetic valvular dysfunction. 
5	Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the transverse colon. Report of a case. Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the bowel is a rare entity. Only five cases have previously been reported--none in the surgical literature. A unique presentation for Yersinia infection, abscess of the transverse colon, is described, and the literature of Y. enterocolitica intestinal perforation and abscess is reviewed. 
1	Efficacy and morbidity of partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. In recent years, we have seen increasing use of partial laryngectomies for larger lesions that were previously treated by total laryngectomy. The resultant closer margins have made postoperative radiation therapy an important adjuvant treatment to conservation laryngeal surgery. We review the University of California, Los Angeles, experience with combination partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy between 1973 and 1987 for treatment of carcinoma of the larynx. Twenty-four such patients who underwent partial laryngectomies and postoperative radiation therapy are examined. Techniques of treatment, complications, and the functional ability of the remaining larynx are discussed. The locoregional control rate at 5 years was 80%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence were positive margins, vascular invasion, and extranodal spread. There were no major problems with postoperative wound healing or airway management during the radiation treatment. Vocal and swallowing function were well preserved in most cases. We conclude that combination partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy permits preservation of laryngeal function without serious complications, and therefore is an effective treatment for selected patients with carcinoma of the larynx. 
3	Permanent external striated sphincter stents in patients with spinal injuries. Nine patients with complete quadriplegia underwent external striated sphincter stenting with the Wallstent in place of an external striated sphincterotomy. Although suprapubic catheters were placed to provide an outlet should problems develop with the stent, they were successfully removed within 6 weeks in all but 1 patient. Complete bladder emptying with reduced voiding pressures was achieved, together with a significant reduction in the duration of hyper-reflexic contractions. Epithelialisation of the stent was almost complete within 3 months and intermittent catheterisation or endoscopy (and resection) is possible through the stent. Although this is a preliminary report of this new technique, it is hoped that sphincter stenting will provide a rapid, safe and effective method of treating high pressure hyper-reflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in quadriplegic patients. 
5	Cochlear implant flap complications. In a series of 52 patients who received cochlear implants, 4 patients suffered flap complications (7.7%). The problems encountered involved the postauricular flap and were usually minor in nature. None required explantation as a direct result of these complications. Flap ischemia in a patient with Cogan's syndrome and vasculitis, two cases of suture extrusion with one having exposure of the implant, and a case of receiver unit magnet extrusion repaired with a vascularized pericranial flap based upon temporalis muscle are presented. Flap design in patients who have had postauricular incisions demands special consideration. Principles useful for avoiding complications as well as their management are discussed. 
4	Insulin and hypertension. Relationship to obesity and glucose intolerance in Pima Indians. The relationships among blood pressure, obesity, glucose tolerance, and serum insulin concentration were studied in 2873 Pima Indians aged 18-92 yr (mean 37 yr). Age- and sex-adjusted to the Pima population, the prevalence of hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, or receiving drug treatment) was 7.1% for subjects with normal glucose tolerance compared with 13.0% for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 19.8% for those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (P less than 0.001). The prevalence ratio of hypertension was 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.5) for IGT and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.2) for NIDDM compared with normal glucose tolerance, controlled for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). In logistic regression analysis, hypertension was positively related to age, male sex, BMI, glucose tolerance, and fasting but not 2-h postload serum insulin concentration. Among subjects not taking antihypertensive drugs, however, neither fasting nor 2-h postload serum insulin was significantly related to hypertension. Furthermore, in 2033 subjects receiving neither antihypertensive nor antidiabetic drugs, blood pressure was not significantly correlated to fasting insulin concentration, and 2-h postload serum insulin was negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, insulin is not significantly related to blood pressure in Pima Indians not receiving antihypertensive drugs. Higher insulin concentrations in drug-treated hypertensive patients might result from the treatment rather than contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Thus, these data do not support a major role for insulin in determining the occurrence of hypertension or regulation of blood pressure in Pima Indians. 
1	Tumors of the central nervous system. Improvement in outcome through a multimodality approach. More children with CNS tumors will continue to be cured of their neoplasms as a result of improved surgical, radiotherapeutic, and chemotherapeutic intervention. The complex problems seen in these patients mandate their treatment at academic centers actively involved in therapeutic investigations and capable of providing comprehensive multidisciplinary care. 
5	Epidurography in premature infants. A caudal epidural catheter was inserted in 20 premature, high risk infants for abdominal or thoracic surgery under combined caudal epidural and general anaesthesia. Epidurography was used to confirm the position of the catheter which was found to be misplaced in three patients. The catheter penetrated the dura in one case, in another the tip was located in an epidural vessel and in the third the catheter was seen to be curled up within the epidural space. It was concluded that epidurographic control is essential with this method of anaesthesia in very small infants, in whom it was found to provide considerable advantages despite serious risks. 
5	Experimental short-bowel syndrome: effect of an elemental diet supplemented with short-chain triglycerides. To determine whether short-chain triglycerides (SCTs, 1:1 triacetin:tributyrin, wt:wt) enhance intestinal adaptation in short-bowel syndrome (SBS), male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 60% distal small-bowel resection with cecectomy and received either a chemically defined diet (CD) or a CD containing 40% of nonprotein energy as either medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or SCTs. After 12 d the SCT group had significantly increased jejunal mucosal weight compared with the MCT and CD groups and had significantly increased segment weight and mucosal protein compared with the CD group. In the colon the SCT group had significantly increased segment and mucosal weights and mucosal protein and DNA compared with both the MCT and CD groups. Body-weight change and measurements of serum ketones, albumin, glucose, and triglycerides revealed no significant differences among groups. SCTs improved jejunal and colonic adaptive growth and maintained comparable nutritional status in SBS when compared with CD alone or CD with MCTs. 
5	Extramedullary blast crisis in a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission. Treatment of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-A) results in complete disappearance of the Ph chromosome in about 10% to 15% of patients in early chronic phase. This group has a long survival and very low incidence of blast crisis. The first known case is reported of extramedullary blastic transformation in a patient with medullary complete cytogenetic response (0% Ph-positive metaphases) to IFN-A. Four episodes of extramedullary blast crisis have occurred in this patient. The first three episodes were lymphoid by morphology and cytochemical stains. Molecular analysis confirmed breakpoint cluster region rearrangement. The most recent transformation was myeloid in nature and involved bone and pulmonary parenchyma. The patient is currently undergoing a second autologous transplantation with stored bone marrow that is Ph negative. The patient has survived more than 18 months since the first episode of blast crisis, and the bone marrow is normal. 
1	Brain stem and spinal metastases of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme: a clinical series. Although the spread of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme to the brain stem and spine has been extensively described in published autopsy series, information on the diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent clinical course of patients manifesting symptoms of glioblastomatous dissemination ante mortem remains scant. We report a series of 11 patients having the signs and symptoms of neuraxis dissemination of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. All patients had radiographic documentation of metastases by either contrast-enhanced myelograms or enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans. Ten presented with spinal involvement, whereas one presented with lower cranial neuropathies secondary to diffuse involvement of the basal cisterns. The mean age of the patients was 38.5 years, and the mean time interval between diagnosis of intracranial disease and diagnosis of metastases was 14.1 months. After diagnosis of tumor spread, subsequent mean survival time was 2.8 months. All patients received additional radiotherapy to the areas of metastasis, but the clinical response to radiotherapy was quite poor. This study confirms previous reports in the literature suggesting that metastases occur in younger patients and in patients with extended survival. The findings suggest that the relatively infrequent clinical incidence of the symptomatic spread of glioblastoma multiforme, as compared with the frequent incidental discovery of such spread at autopsy, may be the result of the limited survival of the affected patients, and not due to the biology of the tumor. 
3	Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of vater. A case of absence of somatostatin in a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, bombesin-, and cholecystokinin-producing tumor. A 31-year-old patient with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice had surgical treatment, and a primary carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater (VA) was found. The tumor was studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The neoplasm had histopathologic and cytopathologic features similar to those encountered in typical neuroendocrine neoplasms. It is interesting that immunohistochemical techniques disclosed the presence of vasointestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and bombesin; however, unlike most neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in VA, no somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were found. 
5	Effects of hyaluronic acid fractions in the rabbit eye. Two fractions of hyaluronic acid with different molecular weight (Ial, molecular weight 500,000-730,000 and Healon, molecular weight 750,000) were injected intracamerally or intravitreously in the rabbit eye. Although the fraction with higher molecular weight caused an increase in intraocular pressure, no change of this parameter was found after administration of the fraction with the lower molecular weight. Furthermore, various inflammatory reactions in ocular tissues were observed during slit-lamp biomicroscopy after administration of Healon but not of Ial. No inflammatory reaction was found after subchronic instillation of the compounds. 
3	Spectral analysis of heart rate in diabetic autonomic neuropathy. A comparison with standard tests of autonomic function. Power spectral analysis of the heart rate was compared with standard tests of autonomic function performed on 15 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. The high-frequency power, low-frequency power, and total power of the heart rate power spectrum measured in the supine position--possible measures of parasympathetic nervous system function--were significant predictors of the expiratory-inspiratory ratio, the beat-to-beat heart rate difference on deep respiration, the standard deviation of the resting heart rate, the 30:15 ratio, and the Valsalva ratio. The change in low-frequency power on moving from the supine to upright position, a possible measure of sympathetic nervous system function, was a modest predictor of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure fall in response to postural change, but a poor predictor of the blood pressure response to isometric exercise and a cold stimulus. This study supports the role of heart rate power spectral analysis as a clinical test of autonomic function in patients with known or suspected autonomic failure. 
2	Gallbladder perforation: correlation of cholescintigraphic and sonographic findings with the Niemeier classification. We retrospectively analyzed the cholescintigrams and sonograms of 36 consecutive patients with gallbladder perforation to (a) determine the sensitivity of each for the preoperative detection of gallbladder perforation and (b) correlate the findings with the modified Niemeier classification. Cholescintigraphic criteria of perforation (free spill, pericholecystic hepatic activity, and scintigraphic gallstone ileus sign) were detected in 14 of 28 (50%) cases, while sonographic criteria of perforation (pericholecystic fluid or pneumobilia with gallstones) were present in 18% (4 of 22) of patients (p less than 0.05). Cholescintigraphic patterns of perforation associated with the Niemeier classification were: Type I (acute free perforation), 3 of 7 scans demonstrated free spill; Type II (subacute pericholecystic abscess), 9 of 19 scans showed pericholecystic activity; and Type III (chronic cholecystoenteric fistula), 1 of 3 scans showed a scintigraphic gallstone ileus. Thus, although cholescintigraphy appears superior to sonography, both modalities are relatively insensitive for the detection of gallbladder perforation. 
5	Expandable biliary metal stents for malignancies: endoscopic insertion and diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth. Seventeen patients with malignant biliary strictures have been treated by endoscopic insertion of self-expandable metallic prostheses. Two patients received two prostheses inserted simultaneously in both the left and right hepatic ducts for Klatskin tumor type III. Immediate results were satisfactory despite an operative mortality of 18%, and neither early nor late clogging was observed even in patients who presented previously with sludge above plastic stents that were removed. However, among five patients followed for more than 4 months, two presented with obstruction due to tumor ingrowth into the stent through the metallic mesh. Accordingly, initial enthusiasm concerning long-term patency of these stents has decreased. However, we describe a technique of "diathermic cleaning" of tumor ingrowth which can easily restore the stent patency. The advantages of these wire mesh 30 F stents are their easier insertion, better immediate drainage, and absence of dislocation or perforation. 
4	When do cerebral emboli appear during open heart operations? A transcranial Doppler study. The transcranial Doppler technique enabled the detection of cerebral air emboli in 10 of 10 patients during open-heart valve operations despite standard deairing procedures. With this technique, the occurrence of emboli in the right middle cerebral artery was followed continuously in patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement. Membrane oxygenators were used. Scattered emboli were observed during the insertion of the aortic cannula, at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, and after the declamping of the aorta with the heart beating while empty. During the period of aortic cross-clamping, no emboli were detected. Despite careful deairing procedures, the recordings indicated a large amount of emboli during filling of the empty beating heart in all 10 patients. Thus, this study indicates that cerebral emboli in open heart procedures are most likely to occur during the redistribution of blood from the heart-lung machine to the patient when the heart is beginning to eject actively, despite careful standard deairing procedures. Meticulous deairing before declamping the aorta is strongly advocated. In addition, a short period of filling of the beating heart before final closure of the aortic incision or vent may decrease the incidence of cerebral emboli. A concomitant reduction in cerebral blood flow by hyperventilation or anesthetics or both during filling of the empty beating heart may also be beneficial. 
3	Oromandibular disorders and headache. A critical appraisal. Oromandibular disorders are functional disorders and associated pains in the anatomic region of the temporomandibular joint. Their diagnosis and treatment are controversial because of the lack of conformity concerning these disorders among health care providers. This article provides a clear classification of these disorders and critically reviews their evaluation and treatment. 
5	Perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery--II: Incidence and severity during the 1st week after surgery. The Study of Perioperative Ischemia (SPI) Research Group. Because of the importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia and because substantial physiologic changes can occur for prolonged periods postoperatively, the incidence, severity and temporal course of myocardial ischemia were studied in 100 high risk patients during the 1st week after major noncardiac surgery. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes consistent with ischemia were continuously monitored using ambulatory solid state ECG in the 100 patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease. Ischemic episodes were defined as reversible ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm or elevation greater than or equal to 2 mm above the baseline value, with the baseline adjusted for respiratory and positional variation and temporal drift. All ischemic episodes were confirmed by three independent blinded investigators using hard-copy recordings. Total ECG monitoring time was 10,445 h. Twenty-seven patients (27%) developed 437 episodes of ischemia during the 1st week after surgery. The total duration of ischemia was 18,658 min, or 1.8 min of ischemia/h monitored. Ischemia was most severe during the early (days 0 to 3) versus late (days 4 to 7) postoperative period: 284 versus 153 episodes; 2.2 versus 1.2 min of ischemia/h. The greatest severity occurred on postoperative day 3: 109 episodes, 3.4 min of ischemia/h monitored, 1.5 mm mean ST change and 130 min mean duration. However, in 8% of patients, severe episodes also occurred late: postoperative day 6 = 44 episodes, 1.7 min of ischemia/h monitored, 1.3 mm mean ST change (59% greater than or equal to 2 mm) and 92 min mean duration. Most ischemic episodes (57%) were associated with tachycardia. 
5	Continuous epidural hydromorphone for postthoracotomy pain relief Forty-four patients were treated with a continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone (0.05%) after thoracic operations. Postoperatively, visual analog pain scores were obtained. On postoperative day 1 and 2, more than 90% of the patients experienced either no pain (visual analog pain scale = 0) or mild pain (visual analog pain score = 1 to 3) at rest. The incidence of side effects (hypoventilation, pruritis, and nausea) was less than reported with other epidurally administered opioids. Continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone produced safe, predictable analgesia after thoracotomy. 
5	Immunoglobulins A, G, and M to cytomegalovirus during recurrent infection in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Occurrence and significance of specific IgA and IgM to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in recurrent CMV infection was evaluated in 21 allogeneic T lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients who had been previously CMV seropositive. Of 17 patients with CMV infection, viruria was detected in 94%, CMV-specific IgA in 88% and IgM in 76%, and a fourfold rise in IgG in 65%. The median time between BMT and detection of viruria was 69 days, of IgA 70, of IgM 62, and of IgG 88 days. The IgM and IgA responses lasted for 14 and 30 days (median time), whereas high IgG titers persisted. Twelve patients developed CMV disease; in these the appearance of viruria, IgA, and IgM preceded the rise of IgG (P less than .02). CMV-specific IgA and IgM are valuable diagnostic tools in BMT recipients with recurrent CMV infection. 
5	The role of carotid screening before coronary artery bypass. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years. 
2	Treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with intermittent high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide PURPOSE: Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity. This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP ("pulse" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis. GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive. Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months. If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter. Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health). RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy. Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated with a high initial response rate. However, failure to respond initially to treatment, to sustain improvement, or to tolerate continued treatment was noted in 79% of patients within a period of 1 to 22 months. These observations indicate that this particular pulse CP protocol does not achieve a high degree of lasting efficacy. 
4	Silent myocardial ischemia: dilemma or blessing? Developing an optimal strategy for the evaluation and management of patients with silent myocardial ischemia is extremely difficult. Although otherwise healthy, asymptomatic individuals may be at risk of dying suddenly during exercise, neither exercise testing nor Holter monitoring reliably identifies those at greatest risk. In patients with underlying coronary artery disease, silent ischemia increases the risk of an adverse outcome. 
4	Echocardiographic diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva: operation without catheterisation in seven patients. A ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva was diagnosed by Doppler, colour, and cross sectional echocardiography in a consecutive series of seven patients. The diagnoses were confirmed at operation without cardiac catheterisation. Examination by pulsed and continuous Doppler echocardiography showed continuous turbulence in six patients with aneurysms rupturing into the right ventricular outflow tract and in the patient with rupture of an aneurysm of the non-coronary sinus into the right atrium. Colour Doppler echocardiography showed turbulent flow across the defects in all seven patients. A ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation was detected in one patient and an associated ventricular septal defect in another. Doppler, colour, and cross sectional echocardiography were useful non-invasive techniques for diagnosing a ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva without the need for cardiac catheterisation. 
4	The effect of enoximone and dobutamine on hemodynamic performance after open heart surgery. A clinical comparison. In a prospective, randomized study the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone was compared to dobutamine after open heart surgery. In either group 25 patients were treated with enoximone and dobutamine, respectively, beginning immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass until 4 hours postoperatively. The drug was administered as a continuous infusion of 5 micrograms/min/kg body weight. Under enoximone a significant increase of cardiac output [enoximone (E): + 100%; dobutamine (D): + 38%] and a significant decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance (E: -34%, D: +65%) and of total systemic vascular resistance (E: -59%, D: -7%) was achieved. Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were not different. Side effects were not observed. Enoximone proved to be safe and superior to dobutamine in low cardiac output states after open heart surgery. 
1	The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958. Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150.3 expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence limits 0.73, 1.03). The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself. 
5	Placebo controlled trial of xamoterol versus digoxin in chronic atrial fibrillation. Thirteen patients in chronic atrial fibrillation with a normal resting heart rate but with exercise tachycardia and episodes of bradycardia were randomised to treatment periods of two weeks on xamoterol (200 mg twice daily), low dose digoxin, or placebo, in a blind crossover study. The results (mean SEM) of symptom scores, a treadmill exercise test, and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained. Xamoterol improved symptom scores and controlled exercise heart rate better than digoxin. Xamoterol was better than digoxin or placebo in reducing the heart rate response to exercise and tended to improve exercise duration. Xamoterol, by reducing the daytime maximum hourly heart rate and increasing the night time minimum hourly heart rate, significantly reduced the difference between the two compared with placebo. In contrast, digoxin tended to reduce both the maximum and minimum hourly heart rates through day and night. Both the frequency and duration of ventricular pauses were reduced by xamoterol but tended to increase with digoxin. Xamoterol reduced both the circadian variation in ventricular response to atrial fibrillation and exercise tachycardia by modulating the heart rate according to the prevailing level of sympathetic activity. These changes were translated into symptomatic benefit for the patients studied. 
4	Basilar artery occlusion in rats. The basilar artery is one of the three major sources of blood supply to the circle of Willis. To investigate the effects of basilar artery occlusion, we surgically exposed and coagulated the basilar artery in 25 rats. Basilar artery occlusion at any single point between the foramen magnum and the circle of Willis in 11 rats did not produce histologically detectable infarcts in the brain at 12-24 hours. Two-point occlusions of the basilar artery in 12 rats produced variable infarcts between the occlusion sites but no ischemic lesions elsewhere. After either single- or double-point occlusions, the proximal basilar artery refilled within 2-3 minutes. When the basilar artery was occluded above and below the origins of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the artery segments between the occlusion points initially collapsed but refilled within 2-3 minutes in two rats. Basilar artery occlusions invariably suppressed cortical somatosensory evoked potentials by greater than 50%. Regardless of whether a brain stem infarct developed, somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes recovered to greater than baseline levels by 4 hours in seven of 17 rats and returned to baseline levels by 24 hours in every rat tested. We conclude that the occluded basilar artery receives extensive retrograde collateral blood flow and that somatosensory evoked potentials are exquisitely sensitive to basilar artery occlusion but are insensitive to whether brain stem infarcts develop. 
5	Intraoperative anaphylaxis: an association with latex sensitivity. Latex products have recently been identified as the cause of severe intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. We have identified a group of pediatric patients who appear to be at increased risk for such reactions. Fifteen patients with either spina bifida or congenital urologic abnormalities experienced 19 intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. All patients had frequent previous exposures to rubber materials since infancy as part of their management and/or investigative procedures. Seven of 15 patients had a previous history of local skin reactions to rubber. Only four patients were atopic. All patients had undergone multiple (two of 26) operative procedures before their reactions, the onset of which ranged from 40 to 290 minutes after induction of anesthesia. The reactions varied in intensity from urticaria to severe cardiorespiratory collapse. All these patients subsequently had positive allergy skin tests and positive RAST to latex antigen. We conclude that this group is at risk when they are exposed to latex intraoperatively as a result of frequent past exposure to these materials. Allergic evaluation for latex allergy may assist in the preoperative evaluation of similar patients. In sensitized patients, appropriate prophylactic measures, particularly the avoidance of latex, is required. 
3	Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention. All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic. Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction. "Cortical" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement. Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis. 
5	Reoperation for intra-abdominal abscess. Reoperative procedures for patients with abscess and other septic complications remain among the most difficult management problems in general surgery. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal septic complications has been greatly enhanced within the last 10 years but remains imperfect and requires clinical judgment that transcends objective methods. Surgical drainage remains the mainstay of care for patients with postoperative intraabdominal abscess. 
5	The natural history of intimal flaps in a canine model. The natural history of arterial intimal flaps has not been well defined. This study characterizes the natural history of unrepaired intimal flaps. Thirty-nine 1-, 2-, and 3-mm hemispheric, distally based intimal flaps were made in 4- to 5-mm diameter canine femoral and carotid arteries. Twenty arteries had 2- and 3-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for short-term arterial thrombosis and flap extension. Nineteen had 1- and 2-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for thrombosis, long-term development of neointimal hyperplasia, arterial stenosis, and persistence of the flap. While 40% of the arteries with 3-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis in 3 to 5 days, only 3% of the arteries with 1- or 2-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis. Most 1- to 2-mm intimal flaps resolved and the subsequent development of neointimal hyperplasia or arterial stenosis was minimal. Arteries with hemodynamically significant stenoses from intimal flaps warrant repair, while arteries with smaller intimal flaps may not require repair. 
5	Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice. Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. 
1	Pachyonychia congenita complicated by hidradenitis suppurativa: a family study. A family is described in which five of the six members with the Jackson-Lawler type of pachyonychia congenita also had varying degrees of hidradenitis suppurativa. We suggest an association between this type of pachyonychia congenita and hidradenitis suppurativa. 
5	Cardiovascular-sympathetic adjustments to nonexertional heat stress in mature and senescent Fischer 344 rats. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the cardiovascular-sympathetic nervous system adjustments during nonexertional heat stress are exaggerated in senescent (S, 24 mo) vs. mature (M, 12 mo) conscious unrestrained Fischer 344 rats. During two separate trials (48 h apart), each animal was exposed to an ambient temperature (Ta) of 42 degrees C until a colonic temperature (Tco) of 41 degrees C was attained and then cooled at a Ta of 26 degrees C until Tco returned to the initial control level. Trial 1: heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and arterial plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and lactate (La) were similar between the S and M groups during the baseline (control) period. The absolute increases in HR, MAP, NE, and E from the control period to the end of heating were of similar magnitudes between groups; however, La increased more in the S than M animals (P less than 0.05). During recovery, the declines toward control levels for all variables were similar or even more rapid in the S vs. M animals (P less than 0.05). Trial 2: the changes in HR and MAP during heating were similar to those observed in trial 1 in both groups. Generally, NE and E control levels were elevated in both groups compared with those in trial 1. The absolute increases in NE during heating were similar to trial 1 in both groups, whereas E increased to a greater extent than in trial 1 in the S animals (P less than 0.05). 
2	Posterior colporrhaphy and perineorrhaphy: separate and distinct operations. Posterior vaginal repair is often poorly understood and ineffectively performed. The goals of reconstructive surgery emphasize relief of symptoms and restoration of normal anatomic relationships and of function. A useful method to preoperatively determine posterior vaginal wall weakness is outlined along with a surgical description of important steps in surgical reconstruction. 
3	Epidermal nevus syndrome: a neurologic variant with hemimegalencephaly, gyral malformation, mental retardation, seizures, and facial hemihypertrophy. The epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) is a sporadic neurocutaneous disorder that consists of epidermal nevi and congenital anomalies involving the brain and other systems. From among over 60 patients with ENS presenting with neurologic manifestations, we identified 17 who had hemimegalencephaly based on pathologic or radiologic studies. Associated brain and neurologic abnormalities included gyral malformations in 12 of 12, mental retardation in 13 of 14, seizures in 16 of 17 (including 9 with infantile spasms), and contralateral hemiparesis in 7 of 12. All had ipsilateral epidermal nevi of the head, and several had ipsilateral facial hemihypertrophy. We concluded that these abnormalities comprise a recognizable neurologic variant of ENS that we believe represents the full expression of primary brain involvement. Several patients also had evidence of acquired brain lesions such as infarcts, atrophy, porencephaly, and calcifications, which are best explained by prior ischemia or hemorrhage. Given repeated observations of blood vessel anomalies in ENS patients, we hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia predisposes to these acquired lesions. The same cause may be invoked to explain the wide variety of neurologic symptoms reported in ENS patients without hemimegalencephaly. While the cause of ENS remains unknown, several observations suggest a somatic mutation. 
5	Role of endogenous angiotensin II in the control of vasopressin secretion during hypovolemia and hypotension in conscious rabbits. In order to investigate the physiological role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the control of vasopressin (VP) secretion, the VP responses to hypotension induced by hemorrhage (20 ml/kg, n = 10) or nitroprusside infusion (1-10 micrograms/kg.min, n = 9) were studied with or without blockade of ANG II formation by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in conscious rabbits. Administration of captopril (5 mg/kg, iv) caused a small decrease in mean arterial pressure but did not enhance the hypotensive response to subsequent hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion. The renin response to both stimuli was enhanced by captopril, whereas the increase in plasma ANG II concentration was attenuated. Plasma VP (PAVP) concentration increased during hemorrhage (2.0 +/- 0.2-113.6 +/- 47.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) and nitroprusside infusion (2.1 +/- 0.3-5.1 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, P less than 0.01). Captopril did not change basal plasma PAVP, nor did it attenuate the VP responses to hemorrhage or nitroprusside. Indeed, captopril tended to enhance the VP responses to hemorrhage (2.3 +/- 0.3-147.1 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) and nitroprusside infusion (1.9 +/- 0.2-15.4 +/- 6.0 pg/ml). The relationship between log PAVP and mean arterial pressure during hemorrhage and nitroprusside infusion in the presence of captopril was not different than in the absence of captopril. These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute to the increase in VP secretion during hypotension induced by hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion. 
4	Lung function and pulmonary regurgitation limit exercise capacity in postoperative tetralogy of Fallot. Fifty-five patients with repair of tetralogy of Fallot were evaluated with treadmill exercise, pulmonary function testing and rest two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography to determine the relation among cardiopulmonary function, exercise capacity and ventricular arrhythmias. The mean age at repair was 8.1 +/- 2.1 years; age at the time of study ranged from 15 to 37 years (mean follow-up time after repair 18 +/- 5 years). Exercise duration was 92 +/- 17% of predicted. Maximal heart rate was 94 +/- 7% of predicted. No exercise test was stopped because of an arrhythmia. Thirty patients had oxygen consumption and ventilation measured during their final minute of exercise. Peak oxygen consumption was 31 +/- 8 ml/kg per min (86 +/- 18% of predicted). Twenty-five patients (45%) had low vital capacity at rest (less than 80% of predicted). Pulmonary regurgitation was identified in 42 (75%) of the patients and judged to be moderate in 10 (18%). Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation was identified in 64%. Doppler estimated right ventricular outflow gradient was greater than 15 mm Hg in 15% of the patients (mean gradient 24 mm Hg [range 16 to 56]). Age at repair, duration of follow-up and type of repair did not correlate with echocardiographic variables, ventilatory data, exercise performance or arrhythmias. Moderate pulmonary regurgitation was associated with increased right ventricular diastolic area and both were inversely related to exercise duration and vital capacity. Decreased breathing reserve during maximal exercise was associated with moderate pulmonary regurgitation and decreased vital capacity. The results indicate that exercise capacity in these patients is in general good; however, right ventricular volume loading and ventilatory dysfunction may produce exercise limitation. 
4	Diagnostic value of ventricular stimulation in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess the response to programmed ventricular stimulation and the clinical outcome, we performed a prospective study in 103 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The protocol used up to three extrastimuli delivered at two right ventricular sites during sinus rhythm and ventricular pacing at 100 and 150 beats/min and was repeated during infusion of 1 to 4 micrograms/min of isoproterenol. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced in 8 of 11 patients with spontaneous sustained VT, in none of 35 patients without significant ventricular arrhythmias during Holter monitoring, and in 9 of 56 patients with salvos of ventricular premature beats. Isoproterenol infusion facilitated the induction of two episodes of sustained VT in patients with spontaneous sustained VT; however, in all but one of the remaining patients, induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was not impaired. During the follow-up period there were eight sudden deaths among patients who initially had syncope, inducible sustained VT, or both and three episodes of sustained VT in patients who initially had nonsustained VT but inducible sustained VT. Isoproterenol infusion can be used to safely facilitate induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The induction of sustained VT was associated with a poor prognosis. 
5	Genotyping of macerated stillborn fetuses. It is generally impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a macerated stillborn fetus. Accurate genotyping of such a fetus may, however, be critical for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and appropriate genetic counseling. In the East Flanders Prospective Twin Study, placental tissue of twin and triplet sets, in some of which one or both members were stillborn and macerated, has been stored at -20 degrees C. Of all these fetuses, sex and zygosity could be determined accurately on the placental deoxyribonucleic acid. We tested the possibility of nongenetic changes in deoxyribonucleic acid that result from maceration or tissue degradation over time in storage on placental samples from monochorionic twins in which only one member was stillborn and macerated. The deoxyribonucleic acid variants in these monozygotic twins were identical whether or not either cotwin was macerated. Thus deoxyribonucleic acid variants can be determined accurately on the placental tissue of macerated fetuses, even after prolonged freezing. 
4	Selective pulmonary vasodilation with ATP-MgCl2 during pulmonary hypertension in lambs. We investigated the effects of infusions of ATP-MgCl2 on the circulation in 11 spontaneously breathing newborn lambs during pulmonary hypertension induced either by the infusion of U-46619, a thromboxane A2 mimetic, or by hypoxia. During pulmonary hypertension induced by U-46619, ATP-MgCl2 (0.01-1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.4-40.7%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at the highest doses (P less than 0.05). Left atrial infusions of ATP-MgCl2 caused systemic hypotension without decreasing pulmonary arterial pressure. During hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, ATP-MgCl2 caused a similar significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.0-41.1%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at high doses (P less than 0.05). Regression analysis showed selectivity of the vasodilating effects of ATP-MgCl2 for the pulmonary circulation during pulmonary hypertension induced either by U-46619 or hypoxia. ATP-MgCl2 is a potent vasodilator with a rapid metabolism that allows for selective vasodilation of the vascular bed first encountered (pulmonary or systemic). We conclude that infusions of ATP-MgCl2 may be clinically useful in the treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension. 
4	Mechanism of intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap. A man with intermittent preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is reported. Once a sinus impulse was blocked in the accessory pathway, the block (ie, loss of preexcitation) was continued for a while until a PP interval reached or exceeded a critical period inducing sudden reappearance of preexcitation. This critical period was considerably longer than the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway. These findings are explained by the use of the concept of electronically mediated conduction across an inexcitable gap in the accessory pathway. It seems that when loss of protection was maintained, the sinus impulse was blocked at the site proximal to the gap, but the impulse passing through the atrioventricular node always reached retrogradely the site distal to the gap, and therefore, the next sinus impulse was blocked again. 
2	Breast-feeding and diarrheal morbidity. This study used a unique longitudinal survey of more than 3000 mother-infant pairs observed from pregnancy through infancy. The sample is representative of infants from the Cebu region of the Philippines. The sequencing of breast-feeding and diarrheal morbidity events was carefully examined in a longitudinal analysis which allowed for the examination of age-specific effects of feeding patterns. Because the work controlled for a wide range of environmental causes of diarrhea, the results can be generalized to other populations with some confidence. The addition to the breast-milk diet of even water, teas, and other nonnutritive liquids doubled or tripled the likelihood of diarrhea. Supplementation of breast-feeding with additional nutritive foods or liquids further increased significantly the risk of diarrhea; most benefits of breast-feeding alone or in combination with nutritive foods/liquids became small during the second half of infancy. Benefits of breast-feeding were slightly greater in urban environments. 
2	Effectiveness of periodic checkup by ultrasonography for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Periodic checkup by ultrasonography was conducted on patients with chronic liver diseases for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 19 months, a total of 2004 examinations were performed on a total of 660 cases (179 cases with liver cirrhosis in the compensatory stage, younger than 70 years; 481 cases with chronic hepatitis, aged 40 to 70 years for men and 50 to 70 years for women). Of the 660 cases, 22 HCC cases (3.3%) were detected and finally diagnosed by angiography and/or histologic examination. Four of those cases (18%) had a single nodule smaller than 1 cm in diameter, and 11 cases (50%) had a single nodule smaller than 2 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 12 cases (55%). In comparison with the control group (83 HCC cases not receiving any periodic checkup), the frequency of small liver cancer and the surgical resection rate in the study group were significantly higher. This examination system by periodic ultrasonography checkup of patients with chronic hepatic diseases was effective for early detection and permitted aggressive therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	Shoulder arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-two Designed After Natural Anatomy (DANA) total shoulder arthroplasties (Howmedica, Rutherford, New Jersey) were performed in 34 rheumatoid patients. Thirty shoulders in 23 patients were followed for a minimum of two years. Twelve of the 30 shoulders (40%) had significant rotator cuff tears. The average rating for pain improved from 3 points preoperatively to 8 points postoperatively for the overall group, and the average rating for function improved from 3 points preoperatively to 6 points postoperatively. Range of motion (ROM) improved substantially in patients treated with a regular glenoid component. Four patients were treated with hooded glenoid components designed to improve stability for shoulders in which the rotator cuff was deficient. In the rotator-cuff-deficient patients, pain and function improved; however, ROM was unchanged. Complications, including one acromial fracture and two loose glenoid components, required revision surgery. 
4	Giant cell arteritis. A case with unusual neurologic manifestations and a normal sedimentation rate. Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a serious inflammatory condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, or other adverse sequelae if not properly treated. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate has traditionally been emphasized as a criterion for making this diagnosis. Delays in diagnosis and unnecessary testing may occur when a patient presents with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a clinical history consistent with this condition. We describe a patient with giant cell arteritis who presented with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and who subsequently developed devastating central nervous system complications. 
4	The effect of doxazosin on platelet aggregation in normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension: an in vitro study. An in vitro assay was used to investigate the effects of doxazosin on the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate. Platelet-rich plasma from normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension was compared. Doxazosin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in both groups, but significantly lower concentrations were required to inhibit platelet aggregation in plasma taken from patients with hypertension. The concentrations of doxazosin that inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro were similar to those that are used clinically to control blood pressure in patients with hypertension. 
3	Moderate hypothermia after cardiac arrest of 17 minutes in dogs. Effect on cerebral and cardiac outcome. Moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) induced before circulatory arrest is known to improve neurologic outcome. We explored, for the first time in a reproducible dog outcome model, moderate hypothermia induced during reperfusion after cardiac arrest (resuscitation). In three groups of six dogs each (N = 18), normothermic ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 17 minutes was reversed by cardiopulmonary bypass--normothermic in control group I (37.5 degrees C) and hypothermic to 3 hours in groups II (32 degrees C) and III (28 degrees C). Defibrillation was achieved in less than or equal to 5 minutes and partial bypass was continued to 4 hours, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. All 18 dogs survived. Electroencephalographic activity returned significantly earlier in groups II and III. Mean +/- SD best neurologic deficit between 48 and 96 hours was 44 +/- 8% in group I, 38 +/- 12% in group II, and 35 +/- 7% in group III (differences not significant). Best overall performance category 2 (good outcome) between 48 and 96 hours was achieved in none of the six dogs in group I and in four of the 12 dogs in the combined hypothermic groups II and III (difference not significant). Mean +/- SD brain total histologic damage score was 130 +/- 22 in group I, 93 +/- 28 in group II (p = 0.05), and 80 +/- 26 in group III (p = 0.03). Gross myocardial damage was greater in groups II and III than in group I--numerically higher overall and significantly higher in group III for the right ventricle alone (p = 0.02). Moderate hypothermia after prolonged cardiac arrest may or may not improve cerebral outcome slightly and can worsen myocardial damage. 
5	Snoring and sleep architecture. The purpose of this study was to examine whether snoring adversely affects sleep architecture and sleep efficiency, and thus may account for the frequent complaints of daytime tiredness and fatigue expressed by heavy snorers. We recruited eight self-confessed heavy snorers and six self-confessed nonsnorers. All subjects had full nocturnal polysomnography, including continuous monitoring of snoring, which was quantified by counting the number of snores per hour of sleep (snoring index), the number of snores per minute of snoring time (snoring frequency), maximal and mean nocturnal sound intensity (dBmax and dBmean, respectively). We found that even the self-confessed nonsnorers snored lightly, with significantly smaller frequency and index than the heavy snorers. Sleep architecture was similar in both groups. Distribution of snoring among the sleep stages differed for light and heavy snorers: light snorers snored uniformly throughout all sleep stages, whereas heavy snorers tended to snore more during slow-wave and REM sleep. Snoring frequency and snoring index were similar during all sleep stages in light snorers, but they were higher during slow-wave sleep in heavy snorers. Wakefulness time after sleep onset and sleep efficiency correlated significantly with the snoring index. We conclude that although snoring does not affect sleep architecture in general, it influences sleep efficiency and wakefulness time after sleep onset; this may have an adverse effect on daytime function of heavy snorers. 
2	Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a late-phase mediator of chronic pancreatitis in the rat. The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of pancreatic inflammation was examined in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model of obstructive pancreatitis. Pancreatic generation of PAF, as measured by bioassay (ie, platelet [3H]serotonin secretion), was determined at various times after induction of inflammation. Tissue levels of PAF in the normal pancreas averaged 600 +/- 49 pg/g, but PAF was not detectable during the initial 24 hours of pancreatitis, a time when the inflammatory reaction would be considered acute, that is, during the period of maximal serum amylase release and the development of interstitial edema. However a substantial increase in pancreatic PAF levels (12 times control levels) was observed 7 to 14 days after duct ligation during the late-phase response interval similar to the situation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in which parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency evolve. One week after duct ligation when PAF levels peaked, an evaluation was made of the effects of PAF antagonists (BN52021 and WEB2170) on pancreatic lesions using Evan's blue extravasation, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acid phosphatase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid. BN52021 or WEB2170 treatment was shown to reduce pancreatic damage and inflammation significantly. Long-term in vivo administration of exogenous PAF (20 micrograms/kg/hr for 7 days) exhibited a reduction of [3H]thymidine uptake into and amylase release from pancreatic acini in vitro. Our observations 1) that pancreatic PAF levels increased significantly during the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation; 2) that inhibition of the action of PAF, through specific receptor antagonism, caused an attenuation of pancreatic lesions; and 3) that chronic administration of PAF resulted in decreased pancreatic regeneration and exocrine function are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF as a late-phase inflammatory mediator in chronic pancreatitis in rats. 
4	Repair of transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Repair of transposition of the great arteries in patients with intact ventricular septum and fixed left ventricular outflow tract obstruction has been restricted to atrial baffle procedures, with or without attempts to relieve or bypass the left ventricular outflow obstruction. However, the suboptimal results of these procedures, coupled with excellent functional results with the arterial switch operation in patients without obstruction, has made anatomic correction the goal in repairing these anomalies. We report a technique for the anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries, intact ventricular septum, and fixed left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Its consideration in these difficult cases is advocated. 
1	Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer of the spine. There is a wide spectrum of presentations for prostate cancer metastatic to the spine. Important factors are the patient's age and general health; the extent and location of spinal involvement; the patient's neurologic status and degree of pain; the relative contribution of a blastic or lytic response; and the experience and training of the spinal surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist. The spine is both a weight-bearing structure and a housing for the spinal cord, and failure to consider both functions may lead to unsatisfactory treatment results. Treatment options include hormonal therapy, inhibitors of bone metabolism, glucocorticoid therapy, radiotherapy, halo-vest, surgical debridement, decompression and stabilization, and appropriate pain management and support. One must not lose sight of the fact that the goals are palliation and that ultimate demise is unavoidable in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. 
5	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and sudden deaths among young adults in Wayne County. Based on postmortem records at the Wayne County Medical Examiners' Office from 1982 to 1986, autopsy results indicated that the deaths of 129 persons aged 20-34 resulted from heart disease: 51 of these deaths were attributed to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), 29 to hypertensive cardiovascular disease, 28 to cardiomyopathy, and 21 to other cardiac causes. The majority of the deaths due to ASCVD occurred among men, both black and white, followed by black women, and the incidence increased with age. All of these deaths due to ASCVD were sudden and accounted for all deaths due to ischemic heart disease in this age group among Wayne County residents. Diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy, a history of seizures, and the recent ingestion of alcohol were all found to be associated with sudden death from ASCVD in this group. Obesity did not seem to be a significant factor. These data suggest that ASCVD is not rare as a cause of death in young adults and some of the risk factors identified in older subjects also operate in this age group. 
1	Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the brain after Hodgkin's disease. An immunohistochemical study. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rarely reported complication of Hodgkin's disease (HD). Two patients with NHL of the brain after HD were studied by histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Both patients were in the second decade, had been treated with radiation and chemotherapy, had experienced a relapse of HD before development of NHL, had no evidence of HD at the time of diagnosis of NHL, and died within 1 year of diagnosis. Both brain neoplasms were large cell immunoblastic lymphomas of B-cell lineage. Patients with HD appear to be at increased risk for NHL of the CNS, which may have a poor prognosis. 
3	Threshold perimetry in tilted disc syndrome. Twelve consecutive patients (17 eyes) with tilted disc syndrome underwent quantified visual field examination with the G1 Octopus program (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). Visual fields were abnormal in all cases. Although field loss was more pronounced in the superotemporal quadrant (P less than .001), it also involved the other three quadrants, thus demonstrating that optic nerve hypoplasia in tilted disc syndrome is apparently not entirely sectorial. Linear regression analysis showed that an increase in mean defect correlated with increase in myopic refractive error (P less than .05). However, the increase in myopic refractive error was found to be related to a decrease in corrected loss variance (P less than .05), indicating that in tilted discs with higher myopia, field loss is more homogeneous. With this series of patients, short-term fluctuation was within normal ranges in all visual fields, showing that this may be an additional clue for differential diagnosis from acquired disorders. 
5	Impact of maternal HIV infection on obstetrical and early neonatal outcome. In a case-control study of 177 HIV-seropositive and 326 seronegative women and their newborns in Nairobi, Kenya, maternal HIV infection at term was independently associated with travel to other African countries [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, P less than 0.0001], history of a blood transfusion since 1980 (OR 3.5, P = 0.01), history of more than one sexual partner in the previous 5 years (OR 1.8, P = 0.02) and unmarried status (OR 1.8, P = 0.02). Neonates of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women differed little with respect to occurrence of congenital malformations, stillbirths, in-hospital mortality, sex, APGAR score, or gestational age. However, the mean birth weight of singleton neonates of HIV-positive women was significantly lower than that of controls (3090 versus 3220 g, P = 0.005), and birth weight was less than 2500 g in 9% of cases and 3% of controls (OR 3.0, P = 0.007). Among neonates of HIV-seropositive women, birth weight was less than 2500 g in 17% if mothers were symptomatic and 6% if mothers were asymptomatic (OR 3.4, P = 0.08). 
5	Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones. During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder. A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult. This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease. Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality. Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective. 
1	Thyroid cancer. There have been important recent advances in our understanding of the biologic nature of thyroid cancer and in the early diagnosis of the disease. Despite these advances, there is still considerable controversy over the management of thyroid cancer, including the extent of surgery, the indications for the use of iodine-131, the effectiveness of thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and the prediction of outcome. In this review, the current status of the diagnosis and management of the various types of thyroid cancer are carefully reviewed and extensively documented. 
4	Splinter hemorrhages as a possible clinical manifestation of cholesterol crystal embolization. We describe a patient with cholesterol crystal embolization who demonstrated splinter hemorrhages of multiple fingernails and toenails as part of her clinical presentations. Our patient's clinical presentation, and review of the medical literature, raise the possibility that cholesterol crystal embolization may be associated with splinter hemorrhages. 
5	The "military family syndrome" revisited: "by the numbers". Because concerns have been raised about high levels of psychopathology in military children, the authors used standardized psychopathology rating scales to survey 213 six-to twelve-year-old children of military parents and their parents. Results from children's symptom self-reports, as well as from teachers' ratings of children, indicated that children's symptom levels were at levels consistent with national norms. In contrast, parents' (especially mothers') ratings of children were significantly higher than national norms, as were parents' ratings of their own symptoms. Also, parents' own symptom reports showed somewhat stronger relationships with life stressors presumably affecting the child than did the children's and teachers' reports. Results suggest that parents' reports of children's symptoms may be mediated by the effects of military life stressors on the parents, but these stressors do not necessarily result in higher symptoms in the children. Overall results do not support the notion that levels of psychopathology are greatly increased in children of military parents. Further studies of military families should address the effects of rank and socioeconomic status, housing, and the current impact of life stressors on the parents as well as the children in order to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions about parts or all of the military community. 
5	Side effects of nalbuphine while reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression: report of four cases. Nalbuphine hydrochloride, an agonist-antagonist opioid, is reported to reverse the respiratory depression of moderate doses of fentanyl (20 micrograms.kg-1) and still provide good analgesia. We report four patients having abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in which we attempted to reverse the respiratory depression of large doses of fentanyl (50-75 micrograms.kg-1) with nalbuphine (0.3 mg.kg-1, 0.1 mg.kg-1 or 0.05 mg.kg-1). Nalbuphine reversed respiratory depression in all four patients and the respiratory rate increased from 10 to 23 breaths per minute, end-tidal CO2 decreased from 7.0 +/- 0.3 per cent to 5.6 +/- 0.7 per cent, and peak inspiratory pressure after 0.1 seconds increased from 4 +/- 1.4 to 13 +/- 2.6 mmHg. However, hypertension, increased heart rate, and significant increase in analogue pain scores accompanied reversal of respiratory depression. Agitation, nausea, vomiting, and cardiac dysrhythmias also were observed frequently. We do not recommend the use of nalbuphine to facilitate early extubation of the trachea after large doses of fentanyl for abdominal aortic surgery. 
3	Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis. We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years. At the time of their second operation the disease was stage IV in 14 women, stage III in 25, and stage I in three. After reoperation, the patients were followed for a mean period of 41.8 +/- 30.3 months. Pain symptoms returned in eight women, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia in eight, and pelvic pain in seven. Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies. The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%. A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months. Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis. 
1	N-ras 61 oncogene mutations in Hurthle cell tumors. Mutations of ras oncogenes are believed to play an important role in the initiation or progression of human tumors. In thyroid tumors the incidence of ras activation by specific point mutations has been reported to range from 33% in follicular adenomas up to 60% in anaplastic carcinomas. Because of our long-standing interest in Hurthle cell tumors, we began a study of 70 such cases to determine the incidence of ras mutations and their clinical correlates. Analysis of N-ras sequences at condon position 61, with the polymerase chain reaction method and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, showed point mutations of the normal codon CAA* in eight tumor samples. One was a mutation from CAA to AAA, one from CAA to CTA,* and six from CAA to CGA. These mutations would result in amino acid substitutions of lysine, leucine, or arginine for the normal glutamine at position 61 in the N-ras protein. Identical ras mutations in two tumors and some of their surrounding thyroid tissue may indicate that activating ras point mutations are an early event in carcinogenesis. The incidence of mutations was 1 of 24 (4%) of the histologically benign tumors, 5 of 34 (15%) of the intermediate tumors (with vascular or capsular permeation), and 2 of 12 (17%) in the malignant group. Four of these eight patients died of metastatic thyroid disease and four are alive without evidence of recurrence. 
2	Association between primary pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension: analysis of its pathophysiology and clinical, laboratory and hemodynamic manifestations. To determine the clinical, laboratory and hemodynamic profile in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and associated portal hypertension, 7 new cases and 71 previously reported cases were analyzed. There was no gender predilection and the average age at diagnosis was 41 years. Liver cirrhosis was the most frequent cause of hypertension (82%) and a surgical portosystemic shunt was present in 29%. Almost invariably, portal hypertension either preceded or was diagnosed concurrently with pulmonary hypertension, favoring the hypothesis that in portal hypertension, the pulmonary vasculature may be exposed to vasoactive substances normally metabolized or produced by the diseased liver, possibly inducing vasoconstriction or direct toxic damage to the pulmonary arteries. Clinically, exertional dyspnea was the most frequent presenting symptom (81%); other symptoms, such as syncope, chest pain and fatigue, were present in less than 33%. An accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound (82%) and a systolic murmur (69%) were the most common physical findings. At least 75% of these patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension on electrocardiography (right ventricular hypertrophy) or roentgenography (cardiomegaly or dilated main pulmonary arteries, or both). Hemodynamic findings included severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure 59 +/- 19 mm Hg) with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output. Treatment was basically palliative and the mean and median survival times were 15 and 6 months, respectively. In brief, on the basis of clinical presentation and laboratory features, patients with combined primary pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension seldom represent a diagnostic challenge. Further research is needed on treatment, which remains palliative. The survival rate is poor and worse than that seen in isolated primary pulmonary hypertension. 
1	The role of ras gene mutations in myeloproliferative disorders. Mutations in the ras genes frequently are found in myeloproliferative disorders. These abnormalities have prognostic significance in the myelodysplastic syndromes, but their clinical importance in other hematopathic states remains unclear. The study of this gene in leukemic conditions is providing insights into the genetic pathways leading to leukemic progression. 
5	The "natural history" of segmental wall motion abnormalities in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. S.P.I. Research Group. Intraoperative segmental wall motion abnormalities (SWMA) detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are sensitive, but not always specific, markers of myocardial ischemia. To determine their incidence, characteristics, and relation to postoperative cardiac morbidity, we continuously recorded the left ventricular short-axis view and 12-lead ECG in 156 high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Monitoring was clinically blinded. Wall motion was scored at predefined clinical, hemodynamic, and ECG events and at periodic intervals (26 +/- 11 samples per patient). We detected 44 episodes of new or worsened SWMA in 32 patients (20%). The severity of most episodes was limited to severe hypokinesis (24/44, 55%) followed by akinesis (16/44, 36%) and dyskinesis (4/44, 9%). The remaining 124 patients had normal wall motion or only mild hypokinesis (56/156, 36%) or chronic SWMA (68/156, 44%). The incidence of new SWMA did not differ for patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those with cardiac risk factors only (22% vs. 19%, P = not significant), although CAD patients had a significantly greater incidence of chronic SWMA (62% vs. 41%, P = 0.02). The incidence of new or worsened SWMA was significantly greater during aortic vascular surgery (38% vs. 17%, P = 0.05). Approximately 40% of all new TEE changes occurred in the absence of either an apparent clinical event or a significant change in systolic blood pressure or heart rate. Ten patients had new or worsened SWMA persisting until the end of surgery, 8 with new akinesis, only 1 developing myocardial infarction. The distribution of new or worsened SWMA and significant intraoperative ST-T changes (n = 19) in this cohort was discordant: temporal overlap between modalities was present in only 5 patients. Major cardiac complications occurred in 5 patients (3.2%), all of whom underwent peripheral vascularization. All patients with cardiac complications and new or worsened SWMA also had intraoperative or early postoperative ST-T changes. We conclude that: 1) continuous TEE recording with offline analysis in this high-risk group of patients revealed a relatively low incidence of new or worsened SWMA (20%), most episodes of which were characterized by severe hypokinesis (55%); 2) episodes were more common in patients undergoing aortic vascular surgery; 3) approximately 40% of episodes were unaccompanied by clinical events or significant hemodynamic changes; 4) episodes were poorly correlated with postoperative cardiac complications; and 5) the discordant relation between TEE and ECG changes observed here necessitates careful monitoring of the ECG when TEE is used clinically. 
5	Promoter deletion and loss of retinoblastoma gene expression in human prostate carcinoma. Mutational inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene (RB) is found in all retinoblastomas and in a subset of other human neoplasms, including sarcomas of bone or soft tissue and carcinomas of lung or breast. Exogenous copies of wild-type RB have been shown to suppress the tumorigenicity of several types of tumor cells with endogenous RB mutations, including a previously described human prostatic carcinoma cell line. To further support a role for RB inactivation in the genesis of prostate cancer, seven primary or metastatic prostate carcinoma specimens were examined for evidence of RB mutation. By the use of immunoblot analysis and immunostaining of histologic sections, RB-encoded protein was readily detected in tumor cells of five specimens, was equivocally detected in one specimen, and was apparently absent from tumor cells of one specimen. RB mutations in the latter case were precisely characterized as (i) a deletion of 103 nucleotides containing transcriptional start sites and (ii) loss of the second RB allele. The 103-base-pair deletion was sufficient to abolish the promoter activity of upstream DNA sequences in a heterologous expression system. These results (i) demonstrate that RB can be inactivated in vivo by mutation of its promoter, (ii) confirm the existence of RB mutations in some human prostate carcinomas, and (iii) suggest the use of immunohistochemical methods to screen for RB mutations in clinical samples of common adult neoplasms. 
5	Duodenal-caval fistula. Duodenal-caval fistula is a rare, often lethal disease that requires prompt diagnosis and surgical correction. A case of duodenal-caval fistula due to duodenal ulceration is presented and discussed. 
3	Recombinant human acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit induces chronic experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. A synthetic gene encoding the 210 N-terminal residues of the alpha-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of human skeletal muscle was cloned into an inducible expression plasmid to produce a fusion protein in high yield in Escherichia coli. Like native human AChR, the recombinant human alpha 1-210 protein induced AChR-binding, AChR-modulating, and AChR-blocking autoantibodies in rats when injected once intradermally as an emulsion in CFA, with Bordetella pertussis vaccine as supplementary adjuvant. The minimum dose of recombinant protein required to induce biochemical signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) with 100% incidence was 2.2 micrograms. With 6.6 to 22 micrograms, serum levels of autoantibodies were persistent, and clinically apparent EAMG lasted more than a month. Clinical, electrophysiological, and biochemical indices of EAMG induced by doses of 66 micrograms or more were more uniformly severe and persistent, with 33% fatality. Rats receiving a control extract of E. coli containing plasmid without the alpha 1-210 codon insert, with adjuvants, did not develop autoantibodies or signs of EAMG. This highly reproducible new model of EAMG induced by a recombinant human autoantigen should be valuable for testing Ag-specific immunotherapeutic strategies that might be applicable to treating acquired myasthenia gravis in humans. 
1	Intraosseous lipomatosis. A case report. We report a case of systemic intraosseous lipomatosis involving the proximal femur, both ends of the tibia, and the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The lesions progressed during a five-year follow-up with a pathological fracture of the tibial plateau. CT scans were characteristic and helpful in diagnosis but MR imaging added little information. Intraosseous lipomatosis is a hamartomatous malformation due to hyperplasia of adipose tissue, and is fundamentally different from solitary benign intraosseous lipoma. Management involves reconstruction of any pathological fracture. Large progressive lesions should be treated by curettage and grafting in an attempt to prevent such fractures. 
5	Trolox protects rat hepatocytes against oxyradical damage and the ischemic rat liver from reperfusion injury. Trolox, a hydrophilic analog of vitamin E, was reported to scavenge peroxyl radicals from artificial systems better than its parent compound. Here we examined the possible cytoprotective effect of Trolox in cultured hepatocytes and in the rat liver. In cultured rat hepatocytes, 0.5 to 16 mmol/L Trolox (with optimum between 1 to 2 mmol/L) was observed to prolong the survival of cells exposed to oxyradicals generated with xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine. The protection by 1 mmol/L Trolox surpassed that provided by either ascorbate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase and/or catalase--each at a level giving its maximal protection in the same system. In both a global and partial model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats, infusion of Trolox (7.5 to 10 mumol/kg body weight) just before reflow reduced by greater than 80% the liver necrosis sustained in untreated (no Trolox) control rats. Such organ salvage was apparently accompanied by approximately 50% reduction in the amount of hepatic conjugated dienes, which were quantified by a highly specific radiochemical assay. Since conjugated dienes are presumed to be good "markers" of oxyradical damage, our data may have provided a semiquantitative link between free radical-induced necrosis and its chemical imprint in vivo. The data also indicated a relatively rapid and potent antioxidant-like action by Trolox on rat hepatocytes and on the postischemic reperfused rat liver. 
4	Contrast echocardiographic mapping of collateralized myocardium in humans before and after coronary angioplasty Conventional coronary arteriography is able to demonstrate the presence of coronary collateral vessels but cannot delineate the specific region of myocardium to which they supply blood. To test the hypothesis that contrast echocardiography can specifically identify collateralized myocardium, contrast echocardiographic perfusion "maps" were compared in patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 12) angiographic evidence of coronary collateral flow, both before and after coronary angioplasty. Contrast echocardiographic images of the mid-left ventricle in the short-axis view at end-diastole were obtained after separate injections of a sonicated contrast agent into both the right and the left coronary arteries. A computer-based contouring system was used to determine the individual areas of myocardium perfused by each of the two coronary arteries and then to superimpose the images of the two perfusion beds. The resulting area of overlapping perfusion represented myocardium receiving blood flow from both coronary systems and was defined as collateralized myocardium. To normalize for heart size, overlap area was expressed as a percent of total myocardial area, which was the area between endocardium and epicardium in the short-axis view. To adjust for differences in vascular distribution, overlap area was expressed as a percent of the perfusion area of the recipient vessel. In patients with angiographic collateral flow, the recipient vessel was that vessel receiving the collateral flow. In patients without angiographic collateral flow, the right coronary artery was considered the recipient vessel. Overlap area was 1.3 +/- 0.4% of total myocardial area and 6.6 +/- 1.7% of recipient vessel area in patients without angiographic evidence of collateral flow compared with 30.6 +/- 2.5% and 89.2 +/- 6.4%, respectively, in patients with angiographic collateral flow (p less than 0.001 for both). In four patients in whom angiographic collateral flow was abolished by angioplasty, overlap area decreased from 30.3 +/- 5.3% to 6.8 +/- 2.7% of total myocardial area and from 100% to 18.5 +/- 5.4% of recipient vessel area (p less than 0.05 for both). Thus, contrast echocardiography is able to map the specific myocardial territory perfused by coronary collateral flow and document an immediate reduction in perfusion in this territory when collateral flow is abolished by angioplasty. 
2	A prospective randomized evaluation of chronic peritoneal catheters. Insertion site and intraperitoneal segment. The insertion site (midline or through the lateral rectus muscle) and type of chronic dialysis catheter (straight or spiral intraperitoneal segment) were evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. Dialysis catheter complications and catheter survival were the endpoints of evaluation. Eighty-five first catheters were evaluated. Neither race, gender, renal diagnosis, type of catheter, nor insertion site was a determinant of dialysis catheter survival. Overall median catheter survival was 308 days. There were 40 catheter complications (70%, n = 28) that occurred during the first 61 days following insertion. Median time to the first complication occurring within the first 61 days was 3 days. Late catheter removals were due to peritonitis episodes that failed to resolve. Complications are frequent with peritoneal dialysis catheters, and care of the peritoneal dialysis catheters requires constant vigilance. 
1	The predictive value of needle localization mammographically assisted biopsy of the breast. This study was done to review critically the experience at the University of California at San Diego in needle localization mammographic biopsy of the breast with regard to use and accuracy in identifying early carcinoma of the breast. Ninety-seven patients underwent needle localization mammographic biopsy of the breast between 1985 and 1987. Indications for this procedure included the presence of microcalcifications or a mass shown on mammographic examination, or both, in conjunction with physical examination which did not define a discrete abnormality in the area. Mammographic, demographic, pathologic, hormone receptor data and staging information were recorded and processed on the MicroVax II computer (Digital Equipment Corporation). Twenty-four per cent of lesions with needle localization mammographic assisted biopsy proved to be malignant. Sixteen lesions were diagnosed as an infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ten of these had an accompanying intraductal carcinoma. Over-all, intraductal carcinoma was present in 16 of the 23 specimens diagnosed as malignant. At biopsy, the margins were clear in 17 of 23, and vascular invasion was present in only one patient with an infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Five were tumor in situ, 12 were stage 1 and five were stage 2 (staging information was not available in one instance). Hormone receptor data were available in 17 of 23 specimens. Estrogen receptors were positive in 13 and progesterone receptors were positive in six. The smallest preinvasive malignant lesion was 4 millimeters, as seen on the mammogram, and the smallest free-standing invasive lesion was 8 millimeters. Preinvasive lesions (intraductal) presented as microcalcifications in 80 per cent. Invasive lesions presented as either a mass (n = 9) or as a mass and microcalcifications (n = 5) in 81 per cent. All five lesions presenting as both a mass and microcalcifications on mammogram proved to be malignant. Multifocal lesions on mammographic examination which proved to be malignant were multifocal pathologically in only 50 per cent. Needle localization mammographic biopsy is useful in detecting early carcinoma of the breast. Biopsy should be done on lesions presenting on mammogram as both a mass and microcalcifications and not observed. Focality of lesions on mammogram does not correlate with focality on biopsy and may be misleading as criteria for operative planning. 
5	Isotretinoin for refractory lupus erythematosus. We describe six patients with cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus who were treated with isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg/day. In each case the cutaneous lesions had proved resistant to systemic corticosteroids and antimalarial therapy. Treatment with isotretinoin resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all cases. Recurrences were similarly rapid when the drug was discontinued. Side effects were minimal and easily controlled by adjustments in dose or by the use of lubricants. 
4	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cough. Prevalence in an outpatient medical clinic population. To determine the frequency of ACE inhibitor cough in an outpatient medical clinic population, a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey using mailed questionnaires was done. Patients were randomly selected from a computerized hospital pharmacy data base. The overall prevalence of cough was 19 percent in the ACE inhibitor groups compared with 9 percent in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group. The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00). This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group. Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor. Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors. 
1	Long-term course of patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after apparent curative primary surgery for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Thirty-one patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after seemingly adequate primary operation for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) were followed for a mean period of 11.9 years after operation. Ten patients had sporadic MTC and the remaining patients were members of families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)--either MEN 2A (15 patients) or MEN 2B (six patients). Overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 90% and 86%, respectively. Only four patients died at the completion of the study: two of MTC and two of unrelated causes. Eleven patients (35.5%) underwent surgical re-exploration after demonstration of recurrent disease clinically or radiologically. In no patient did the calcitonin level return to normal after re-exploration. The presence of more than three metastatic nodes at the time of initial operation was a statistically significant (p = 0.003) predictor for disease recurrence. Factors approaching statistical significance were patients younger than age 35 (p = 0.06) and the percentage of cells in the S phase of cell division (0.07). This data supports a conservative surgical philosophy in the management of the patient with persistent hypercalcitoninemia after resection of MTC. 
5	T cell recognition of transforming proteins encoded by mutated ras proto-oncogenes. Activated ras proto-oncogenes contribute to the pathogenesis of many animal and human malignancies. ras proto-oncogenes are generally activated by point mutations within codons 12 or 61, which result in the expression of ras protein (p21) bearing characteristic single amino acid substitutions at the corresponding residues. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the presence of single transforming amino acid substitutions can render normal ras protein immunogenic and, thus, a possible target for T cell-mediated tumor therapy. In initial experiments, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5 through 16 of p21 containing the transforming substitution of arginine for normal glycine at residue 12. The results demonstrated that class II MHC-restricted T cells which were specific for the peptide could be elicited, and that the peptide-induced T cells could specifically recognize the corresponding intact p21 ras protein. Recognition of p21 ras protein by peptide-specific T cells implies that C57BL/6 APC can process the activated ras protein in a fashion that allows presentation of digested protein by class II MHC molecules in a configuration similar to the configuration with synthetic peptide. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of peptides containing alternative transforming amino acid substitutions of ras protein demonstrated that some, but not all, were immunogenic in individual strains of mice. Therefore, although ras protein-specific T cells can be elicited by immunization with synthetic peptides, not all of the potential ras mutations commonly associated with malignancy may be recognizable by T cells from all individuals. 
4	Left ventricular rupture complicating percutaneous mitral commissurotomy: salvage using percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support. Left ventricular rupture resulting in death has been reported to be a complication of percutaneous mitral commissurotomy. We report a 71-year-old man in whom a left ventricular rupture occurred during percutaneous mitral commissurotomy and resulted in hemodynamic collapse due to acute cardiac tamponade. The patient was stabilized using percutaneously instituted cardiopulmonary bypass support with subsequent repair of the left ventricle and successful mitral valve replacement. Three months later this patient remains in New York Heart Class I. 
5	Alcohol consumption--a risk factor for hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke. PURPOSE: The risks of alcohol consumption and its association with stroke were studied in 621 patients with stroke and 573 control subjects using case-control methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke were subdivided into 193 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 337 with cerebral infarction. Data on recent alcohol consumption were obtained by questionnaire in patients with stroke and compared with data from an occupational screening survey in control subjects. RESULTS: Relative risks, adjusted for confounding variables, exhibited J-shaped associations with increasing levels of alcohol consumption classified into four categories--abstainer, 1 to 90 g, 100 to 390 g, and greater than or equal to 400 g weekly). The individual risks were 1, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.3 for subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1.0, 0.6, 0.5., and 2.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.4 for cerebral infarction for men and women combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low levels of alcohol consumption may have some protective effect upon the cerebral vasculature, whereas heavy consumption predisposes to both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke. 
5	Infarct of the conus medullaris simulating a spinal cord tumor: case report. A 71-year-old woman had the sudden onset of a neurogenic bladder and a stepwise increase in paraparesis that left her unable to stand or walk. Magnetic resonance imaging showed what appeared to be a tumor in the conus medullaris. After laminectomy, the lesion was localized by ultrasound examination, and a biopsy was performed. The deficits remained unchanged postoperatively. Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen showed necrosis and pathologic changes consistent with infarction of the conus medullaris. An anomalous arterial supply of the conus medullaris is the most likely cause of this unusual problem. The patient gradually regained her ability to walk, but the neurogenic bladder persists. 
5	Fresnel prisms improve visual perception in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. We randomly assigned 39 patients with stroke and homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect to treatment with 15-diopter plastic press-on Fresnel prisms (n = 18) or to serve as controls (n = 21). Baseline evaluations of visual perception and activities-of-daily-living (ADL) function were similar for both groups. After 4 weeks, the prism-treated group performed significantly better than controls on the following: (1) Motor Free Visual Perception Test; (2) Line Bisection Task; (3) Line Cancellation Task; (4) Harrington Flocks Visual Field Screener; and (5) Tangent Screen Examination. There was no significant difference in Barthel ADL assessment at 4 weeks. Thus, treatment with 15-diopter Fresnel prisms improves visual perception test scores but not ADL function in stroke patients with homonymous hemianopia or unilateral visual neglect. 
5	Role of dipyridamole-echocardiography test in the evaluation of coronary reserve after coronary artery bypass grafting. The object of this study was to assess the usefulness of the dipyridamole-echocardiography test in the early evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting, when the use of an exercise stress test is precluded. We studied 39 consecutive patients (37 men and two women, mean age 57.3 years) referred to our institute for elective coronary artery bypass. Five patients had single, 12 patients double, 20 patients triple vessel disease, and two had left main stem disease. Nineteen left internal mammary artery grafts, 20 sequential grafts, and 39 single vein grafts were performed. All the patients were subjected to the test before (time range 1 to 3 days) and after (time range 6 to 10 days) the operation in the absence of therapy. Dipyridamole was administered intravenously 0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes (low dose); if no effect was apparent, an additional 0.28 mg/kg over 2 minutes (high dose) was given. During the test, blood pressure and a twelve-lead electrocardiogram were monitored. An arbitrary wall motion score was derived by dividing the left ventricle into six regions and grading from 0 to 3-normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic zones. Preoperatively the test was positive in 38 patients as evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (36 patients had electrocardiographic changes) and in one patient by electrocardiographic changes and chest pain; 22 tests were positive after the low dose and 17 after the high dose. Angina was present in 33 patients. Mean wall motion score was 1.64 per patient in the basal condition and 4.03 per patient after the test (p less than 0.001). After coronary bypass in three patients the test was positive at the same dosage that was used preoperatively, as shown by wall motion abnormalities (in two patients by electrocardiographic changes, as well). Four patients had symptoms. Furthermore, at 6 months' follow-up, a treadmill stress test performed in these three patients was positive for ischemia and angina. The wall motion score was 1.25 per patient in the basal condition and 1.53 per patient after the test (no significant difference). When the preoperative wall motion score obtained after dipyridamole echocardiography was compared with the postoperative score, a statistically significant difference was seen: 4.03 per patient versus 1.53 per patient (p less than 001). In eight patients we observed an improvement of basal myocardial contractility after the operation, which indicates the reversibility of wall motion abnormalities observed before coronary bypass. In conclusion our data show that the dipyridamole-echocardiography test is a suitable method for the early assessment of bypass grafting when other methods, exercise dependent, are not indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Acute aluminum toxicity after continuous intravesical alum irrigation for hemorrhagic cystitis. An encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy developed in a seventeen-year-old girl with chemotherapy-induced renal failure while receiving an intravesical aluminum infusion for hemorrhagic cystitis. Premortem serum and postmortem tissue aluminum levels were markedly elevated. It is likely that her inability to excrete absorbed aluminum contributed to her death. Aluminum infusions should be used with caution in patients with renal failure. 
2	Early carcinoma of the gallbladder: macroscopic features and US findings. To facilitate early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, a comparative study of macroscopic forms and ultrasonographic (US) features of stage I (TNM staging system) gallbladder cancer was carried out retrospectively in 71 cases of such carcinomas that were resected surgically. Macroscopic forms of the lesions were classified into four types: pedunculated (eight cases), sessile (15 cases), superficial raised (25 cases), and flat (23 cases). Among 71 cases, only 20 were diagnosed preoperatively by means of US. US patterns of the lesions were also classified into four types: fungating mass, lumen filling, smooth raised, and thickening of mucosa. US features corresponded well to the macroscopic forms. No flat lesion was identified preoperatively. For early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, it seemed essential to pay careful attention to mild mucosal change, as more than 50% of early cancers did not show apparently protruding lesions. 
3	Repetitive strain injuries. How to deal with 'the epidemic of the 1990s'. Occupational trends, especially the mushrooming of computer use in the United States, have brought with them a virtual epidemic of repetitive strain injury of the upper limb. What can you as a primary care physician do to stem the tide? In this article, the authors fill you in on treatment of the most common injuries as well as remark on the ramifications for business and industry. 
1	Traumatic enucleation for posterior uveal melanoma. Two features of eyes enucleated for posterior uveal melanoma that may serve as indicators for traumatic enucleation and relate to dissemination of tumor cells at the time of enucleation are myelin artifact of the optic nerve head and acute hemorrhage within the tumor. Myelin artifact occurs when crushed optic nerve tissue is squeezed into the eye at the time of enucleation. Intralesional hemorrhage may occur during surgery and may be correlated with fluctuations in intraocular pressure. We reviewed 519 cases of posterior uveal melanoma treated by enucleation between 1950 and 1970. Without knowledge of the follow-up data, we examined histologic sections for myelin artifact, intralesional hemorrhage, subretinal hemorrhage, Callender cell type, size of tumor, necrosis, and scleral or orbital invasion. Neither myelin artifact nor intralesional hemorrhage were independent prognostic risk factors. These findings do not support or refute the hypothesis that excessive trauma during enucleation results in a worse prognosis. 
3	Marked cerebrospinal fluid void: indicator of successful shunt in patients with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The authors blindly reviewed the charts of 20 patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (a disease of unknown cause characterized radiologically as chronic communicating hydrocephalus and clinically by gait apraxia, dementia, and incontinence) who had undergone creation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The initial clinical response to surgery was graded excellent, good, fair, or poor; 5-year follow-up was available in 55% of cases. The magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in these patients were also blindly reviewed for the magnitude of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow void (graded on the basis of extent rather than degree of signal loss) in the cerebral aqueduct. A significant (P less than .003) correlation existed between good or excellent response to surgery and an increased CSF flow void. The presence of associated deep white matter infarction on MR images did not correlate with a poor response to surgery. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that patients who fulfill the clinical criteria of NPH and have an increased CSF flow void undergo creation of a shunt. 
3	Effect of hydrocephalus on prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. The concentrations of prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (prostacyclin metabolite), and thromboxane B2 were assayed in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 28 patients with hydrocephalus (17 obstructive, 11 communicating). Seven patients received dexamethasone or hydrocortisone on the day of sampling. No patient received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds for 48 hours before sampling. The median values did not differ significantly between the two types of hydrocephalus or from the concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients without intracranial pathology during lumbar myelography for possible lumbar disc disease. Hence, there is no evidence that eicosanoids accumulate in the ventricles in hydrocephalus, and it is unlikely that they have a significant role in its symptomatology. 
5	Chronic sinusitis and the yellow nail syndrome. Diagnosing syndromes that include chronic sinusitis can expedite the management of both conditions. Yellow nail syndrome is usually described as the combination of yellow nails, lymphoedema and often respiratory manifestations such as chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and pleural effusions. The pathology responsible for the syndrome is believed to be lymphatic hypoplasia. Diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome is clinical not requiring any specialized tests. In the two cases described, the respiratory tract manifestations required the most active investigation and management. The significance of this syndrome to the otolaryngologist is discussed. 
3	Familial trigeminal anesthesia. Familial congenital trigeminal anesthesia as an isolated abnormality is an unusual disorder. To our knowledge, only one family has previously been reported. We report here a family with three affected members demonstrating facial anesthesia, bilateral corneal changes, and nasal septal damage secondary to self-traumatization. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated hypoplasia of gasserian ganglia and trigeminal nerves in the affected father of two affected sons. The pathogenesis of this disorder appears to be congenital hypoplasia of the trigeminal nerves and gasserian ganglia that is inherited in a dominant fashion. 
4	Dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus on ruptured false tendons. A 68-year-old man was admitted with congestive heart failure. He was treated with diuretics and digitalis; thereafter, the two-dimensional echocardiogram suggested a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus. He underwent surgical thrombectomy because of the high risk of systemic embolization. To our knowledge, this is the first case of dilated cardiomyopathy with a mobile left ventricular thrombus that was attached to ruptured false tendons. 
2	Laser recanalization versus endoscopic intubation in the palliation of malignant dysphagia. Forty patients with widely disseminated or locally advanced malignant obstruction of the middle or lower third of the oesophagus underwent endoscopic treatment by either NdYAG laser recanalization or intubation. Groups were matched on the basis of tumour location and swallowing was graded clinically before and after treatment. Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients. Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups. However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization. Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001). Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group. Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour. Intubation at a single session seems more appropriate than repeated laser therapy when tumour length exceeds 4 cm. 
4	Axillary subclavian vein thrombosis. Changing patterns of etiology, diagnostic, and therapeutic modalities. Fifty-two patients with axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis were treated in the last 10 years and were available for follow-up for at least 1 year. Eighteen of these were treated in the first 5 years, Group A, and 34 in the last 5 years, Group B. The causes in both Group A and Group B included respectively: effort or spontaneous 28 per cent and 29 per cent, catheter insertion related 17 per cent and 47 per cent, and malignancy or systemic disease 55 per cent and 24 per cent. None of the patients in Group A had noninvasive vascular testing (NIT). However, 27 patients in Group B had IPG/duplex imaging (NIT). All 18 cases in Group A and 27 cases in Group B were treated conventionally (anticoagulants). Seventy-three per cent of these had residual pain on exertion (venous claudication) and/or swelling. Fourteen of these cases had posttreatment NIT/venography. Four of these showed total resolution of the thrombus and all were symptom free. Ten had no resolution, and nine were symptomatic. Seven cases in Group B were treated with thrombolytic therapy. Five of these had total resolution of thrombus and were symptom free (71%). Two had no resolution with residual symptoms (29%) (statistically significant). In conclusion (1) More patients with axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis seen recently are catheter insertion related; 2) Diagnosis should be initiated with duplex imaging; and (3) Thrombolytic therapy significantly decreased residual symptoms and yielded better resolution than anticoagulants. 
1	Endoscopic retrograde brush cytology. A new technique. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been shown to be a very valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of malignancy involving the biliary and/or pancreatic ductal system. However, characteristic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography radiographic findings associated with malignant strictures are frequently not specific and cytological confirmation becomes essential for the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the current overall diagnostic yield of positive cytology in such circumstances ranges from 18%-56% depending on the technique. A new brush device has been designed which is uniquely adapted to pancreaticobiliary strictures of varying anatomical configurations. This study shows results using this new cytology brush in a series of 53 patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy. A significant improvement in the cytological yield of tumor confirmation was obtained with a diagnostic sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% using the new brush technique. 
5	Plasma norepinephrine in chronic schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence indicate altered noradrenergic function in schizophrenia. The authors examined resting, standing, and change (standing minus resting) in plasma norepinephrine levels in 14 drug-free patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in 33 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Schizophrenic patients had significantly higher resting and standing plasma norepinephrine levels and significantly greater change. Resting and standing levels were significantly related to positive and negative symptoms. There was a significant positive correlation between resting plasma and CSF norepinephrine levels and a significant negative correlation between CSF homovanillic acid and resting, standing, and change in plasma norepinephrine levels. 
2	Cystic dilatation of the cystic duct: a new type of biliary cyst. A case of a patient with a congenital cyst that was localized solely to the cystic duct is presented. We propose including this anomaly in the biliary cyst classifications, which currently include choledochal and intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary cysts. The diagnosis and management of this new type of cyst in addition to other types of biliary cysts are discussed. 
5	7th nerve palsy after extradural blood patch. We describe a patient who developed a 7th cranial nerve palsy following an extradural blood patch; full recovery followed. The likely aetiology is discussed. 
4	Cardiac echinococcosis with fatal intracerebral embolism. A previously well 7 year old boy presented with sudden loss of consciousness and fitting. No evidence of trauma or space occupying lesion was identified. Death occurred the next day due to cerebral infarction caused by embolised fragments from a ruptured left ventricular hydatid cyst that was found at necropsy. 
3	Chinese-white differences in the distribution of occlusive cerebrovascular disease. The distribution of cerebrovascular lesions is affected by race. Blacks and Japanese have more intracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease, while whites have more extracranial disease. Despite a high incidence of stroke in China, there are few formal studies of the distribution of vascular occlusive disease in Chinese populations. We compared clinical and angiographic features of 24 white and 24 Chinese patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. In symptomatic vascular territories, whites had more severe (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more severe intracranial lesions. When we counted mild and severe lesions in a symptomatic territory, whites had more extracranial lesions while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. When we combined symptomatic and asymptomatic territories, whites had more extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. White patients reported more transient ischemic attacks. The distribution of lesions, however, was not explained by differences in incidence of transient ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or ischemic heart disease between the groups. The preponderance of intracranial vascular lesions in Chinese patients is similar to that seen in blacks and Japanese. Racial differences in the occurrence of extracranial and intracranial lesions raise the possibility of a different underlying pathophysiology for the 2 locations. 
5	Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results. 
4	Changes in plasma free fatty acids and glycerols during prolonged exercise in trained and hypertensive persons taking propranolol and pindolol. The extent to which lipolysis is attenuated during prolonged submaximal exercise during beta blockade was determined in 12 normotensive endurance-trained and 12 hypertensive sedentary men using nonselective drugs with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Initially, subjects performed a graded treadmill test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). This was followed by 2-hour walks at 25 and 45% of the subject's VO2max under each of 3 treatments: pindolol (ISA), propranolol (non-ISA) and placebo. The distribution of medication was randomized and double blinded. Blood samples taken at rest and every 30 minutes during the 2-hour walks were analyzed to determine the concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. On the basis of the respective changes in FFA, glycerols and the respiratory exchange ratio, beta-adrenergic blockade did not attenuate lipolysis in the untrained hypertensive subjects when compared with the placebo administration. However, beta blockade did demonstrate a tendency to attenuate lipolysis in the trained, normotensive subjects when compared with results after placebo administration. This was particularly evident at 30 minutes of exercise, when both glycerol and FFA concentrations were not increased above resting values under both conditions of beta blockade. No differences between pindolol and propranolol were observed. Therefore, a beta-blocking agent with ISA properties appears to have no clear benefit with respect to lipid metabolism during low and moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that beta blockade does not inhibit exercise-induced lipolysis at low and moderate intensities of exercise as formerly believed, and is unlikely to be the cause of fatigue normally observed during work in patient populations taking beta-blocking medication. 
5	Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection. Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen. Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl. Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats. We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury. 
4	Campylobacter fetus infection of abdominal aortic aneurysm. A 61-year-old man with Campylobacter fetus infection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm treated surgically is presented herein, the fifth survival case reported in the literature. Fever and back pain preceded the enlargement of atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient tolerated satisfactorily total excision of the aneurysm followed by axillo-femoral prosthetic bypass. Antibiotic therapy consisted of intravenous infusion of fosfomycin and gentamicin and oral administration of minocycline. The organism cultured from the aneurysmal wall and intraluminal thrombi was identified as Campylobacter fetus from its typical characteristics. It is concluded that this organism should be considered in all cases of infected aneurysm in elderly or debilitated patients. 
2	Stercoral perforation of the colon. Stercoral perforation of the colon is rare. The 64 reported cases are reviewed to define the syndrome of stercoral perforation, and to facilitate accurate diagnosis and treatment. Features of localized or generalized peritonitis were universal; however, only 11 per cent were correctly diagnosed before operation. Recognition that the disease involves a segment of colon rather than only the focal point of perforation is essential to adequate surgical treatment. It is postulated that this is the reason for the higher postoperative mortality following closure of the perforation and proximal colostomy (57 per cent) or exteriorization alone (43 per cent), compared with resection of the diseased segment and exteriorization (32 per cent). Resection and exteriorization is therefore the treatment of choice is most situations. 
4	Prognostic factors in acute renal failure following aortic aneurysm surgery. This study analyses the prognostic factors associated with survival in 70 patients who developed acute renal failure following surgery for an aortic aneurysm. Forty-nine patients (70 per cent) had surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm and 21 patients (30 per cent) had an elective procedure. Fifty-nine patients received haemodialysis. Thirty-three patients (47 per cent) survived the episode of acute renal failure. Six of these thirty-three patients died within three months of recovering from acute renal failure, giving an overall survival of 27/70 (39 per cent). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors significantly adversely affected survival: a need for inotropic support, ventilation for more than three days and age over 65 years. A model developed using these variables provided a basis for predicting outcome. 
3	Adrenal medullary implants in the rat spinal cord reduce nociception in a chronic pain model. Previous work in this laboratory has indicated that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the subarachnoid space of the rat spinal cord can reduce pain sensitivity to acute noxious stimuli, particularly following stimulation by nicotine. This most likely results from the stimulated release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells. However, chronic pain models may more closely resemble human clinical pain, and the arthritic rat model has been used for screening potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for adrenal medullary tissue implanted into the spinal subarachnoid space to alleviate chronic pain. Adrenal medullary tissue was implanted into adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, and changes in body weight and vocalization responses were monitored over the 10 week course of the disease. Results indicate that the severe weight reduction normally associated with this inflammatory arthritis was attenuated by adrenal medullary, but not control, implants. In addition, vocalizations were reduced in animals implanted with adrenal medullary, but not control tissue following nicotine stimulation. This reduction was blocked by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, and partially attenuated by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine. Together, these results suggest that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord may provide a local source of opioid peptides and catecholamines for the reduction of chronic pain. 
1	Enhanced expression of oncogene-encoded mRNA in a rat model of colon cancer. We have studied the expression of oncogene-encoded mRNAs in a rat model of colon cancer. In this model, rats are intrarectally administered several low doses of the direct-acting carcinogen, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Tumors, predominantly adenomas, develop 5-7 months following administration of the carcinogen, and many of these progress to carcinomas. Upon assaying the steady-state levels of oncogene-encoded transcripts in normal rat colon, we found that fos and N-myc are highly expressed; H-ras, K-ras, myc, myb, and neu messages are present at lower levels; and N-ras, abl, and raf mRNAs are absent. When we compared transcript levels in rat tumors to those in normal colons from the same animal, we observed a 2-4 fold increase in both myc- and H-ras-encoded mRNAs and a 2-7 fold increase in myb message, but no change in expression of any of the 7 other genes. To test whether this increased expression is related to tumor production or is simply a result of the more rapid cellular turnover observed in tumor tissue, the level of oncogene-encoded transcripts was assayed in colonic mucosae of rats given two treatments known to enhance cell turnover and DNA synthesis in the colon. Neither acute application of MNU nor a diet containing 1% cholic acid caused any change in the level of oncogene-encoded mRNAs in rat colons, thus suggesting that the increased abundance of myc, myb, and H-ras messages in tumors is associated with tumor formation. The enhancement of expression of these genes in adenomas, as well as in carcinomas, further suggests that these alterations occur relatively early during the tumorigenic process. 
4	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and quality of life. The term quality of life implies more than adverse effects that make treatment intolerable. It is not new but has only relatively recently become a parameter to be measured in patients treated for cardiovascular disease. Lessons can be learned from other conditions in which the Karnovsky Index and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale have been used. Several investigators have used questionnaires to assess quality of life during antihypertensive therapy. However, assessment of the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on quality of life has only been done recently. The largest and best known study, of 625 white men with mild hypertension, reported that patients given captopril showed a significant improvement after 6 months in general well-being, work performance, and those skills associated with cognitive function. No such improvement was found with methyldopa and there was significant worsening in measures associated with depression, sexual dysfunction, and life satisfaction. The propranolol group, while showing improvement in cognitive functioning and social participation, manifested worsening of sexual function and physical symptoms. Diuretic therapy had a greater negative impact on the quality of life of hypertensive patients than captopril, propranolol, or methyldopa alone. Whether these results will be seen in other patient populations, and the pharmacological basis for these results, remains to be determined. As newer agents become available (eg, beta-blockers with ancillary properties, calcium channel blockers with allegedly more selective actions on various vascular beds), comparative studies between these agents and ACE inhibitors old and new are awaited with interest. 
1	Primary papillary carcinoma of a thyroglossal duct cyst: report of a case and literature review. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common anomaly in thyroid development. They are twice as frequent as branchial cleft abnormalities and, in children, are second only to enlarged cervical lymph nodes as the cause of neck mass. Generally, duct cysts are benign, but 1 per cent of cases may be malignant. From the world literature, 114 cases of malignant thyroglossal cysts were available for review. With the addition of our own case, we discuss 115 instances of duct cysts. The different types of neoplasia described included thyroid papillary carcinoma in 81.7 per cent, mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma in 6.9 per cent, squamous cell carcinoma in 5.2 per cent, follicular and adenocarcinoma in 1.7 per cent each, and malignant struma, epidermoid carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma in 0.9 per cent each. Of the 115 cases surveyed, 35 thyroid glands were examined microscopically; of these, four (11.4 per cent) contained malignant foci. Whether these are primary malignancies of the thyroglossal duct cysts or metastases is discussed. 
4	Lower extremity arterial disease in elderly subjects with systolic hypertension. The ratio of ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure (ankle/arm index or AAI) appears to be a non-invasive indicator of flow-significant atherosclerosis and may be a useful measure of burden of disease in a high risk population. The prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) was assessed by this method in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). Subjects were aged 60 and older with systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg upon entry to the study. An AAI of 0.90 or less was considered indicative of flow-significant LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD by this method was 26.7% (50/187), while the prevalence of intermittent claudication (IC) was only 6.4% (12/187). Of those with IC, 66.7% (8/12) had confirmed LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD as measured by AAI increased with age in women and was associated with a history of current smoking and lower levels of high density lipoproteins. In this study population with systolic hypertension, LEAD, as measured by the AAI, is more prevalent than previously described in elderly populations and is associated with other risk factors for atherosclerosis. 
4	Spontaneous termination of reentry after one cycle or short nonsustained runs. Role of oscillations and excess dispersion of refractoriness. This study describes factors that contribute to spontaneous termination of reentry lasting one to 10 cycles after induction by a single premature stimulus. Reentry was studied in vitro in rings of canine atrial tissue from around the tricuspid valve orifice. Activation was recorded from a circular array of 10 extracellular bipolar electrodes equally spaced around the ring. In some experiments, transmembrane or monophasic action potential recordings were made near critical sites. Termination of reentry within one cycle after induction was recorded 110 times in 11 of 35 experiments. Important factors contributing to termination were 1) an obligatory reversal of the activation sequence that resulted in a long coupling interval in the critical region beyond the site of unidirectional block after the premature stimulus and 2) much longer refractory periods limited to this critical region, which facilitated unidirectional block but contributed to termination when this region was first activated with a short coupling interval at the end of the first reentrant cycle. Termination of nonsustained reentry lasting longer than one cycle resulted from oscillations of conduction and refractoriness initiated by the abrupt shortening of cycle length after initiation of reentry. Oscillations of conduction resulted from interval-dependent conduction of reentrant impulses that encountered partially refractory tissue. For reentry to become sustained, the oscillations after induction of reentry must dampen. Thus, damped cycle length oscillations after induction may identify clinical tachycardias caused by reentry with a partially excitable gap. 
3	Treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy with topical capsaicin. Case report. A 31-year-old woman with intractable reflex sympathetic dystrophy experienced nearly complete, though temporary, resolution of pain following 3 weeks of topical capsaicin. We propose that capsaicin may be a useful treatment for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, either by depleting substance P from primary afferent neurons that mediate allodynia, or by modulating sympathetic efferent activity. 
2	Alpha 1-antitrypsin excretion in stool in normal subjects and in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Fecal clearance of plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin is used as a measure of protein leakage into the intestinal tract. In this study, the alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in stool and the plasma clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal subjects and in a consecutive series of patients with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or unexplained hypoalbuminemia was determined. The normal subjects were studied in their usual state and also when they had diarrhea secondary to ingestion of lactulose, sorbitol, sodium sulfate, or phenolphthalein. The study first concluded that induced diarrhea can cause an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance; if this is not considered in establishing normal values, there may be an overdiagnosis of excess protein leakage in patients with diarrhea. Second, there is a highly significant statistical correlation (P less than 0.001) between alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and serum albumin concentration. On average, the serum albumin falls below 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L) when the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance exceeds 180 mL/day, a value that is about threefold higher than the upper limit of normal. Third, three of nine patients with microscopic/collagenous colitis had elevated clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin; by contrast, abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was not found in 23 patients with idiopathic secretory diarrhea. Fourth, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration is not a reliable index of abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. 
5	Clinical use of the 193-nm excimer laser in the treatment of corneal scars Phototherapeutic keratectomy using a 193-nm excimer laser was performed at four centers on 33 sighted patients with corneal opacity and/or irregular astigmatism. Pathologic conditions included anterior stromal and superficial scarring from postinfectious and posttraumatic causes, including inactive herpes simplex virus, anterior corneal dystrophies, recurrent erosions, granular dystrophy, and band keratopathy. Most patients received peribulbar anesthesia and underwent removal of the epithelium prior to laser ablation. A majority of patients had a reduction in the amount of corneal scarring and approximately half had improved visual acuity. No intraocular reaction or changes in endothelial counts were seen, and some patients avoided the need for penetrating keratoplasty. Reepithelialization usually occurred within 4 or 5 days and we noted no significant scarring secondary to use of the laser. It was difficult to eliminate preexisting irregular astigmatism despite the use of surface modulators, such as methylcellulose. A hyperopic shift secondary to corneal flattening was encountered in approximately 50% of the patients. A combination of myopic ablation, followed immediately by a secondary hyperopic steepening, may minimize this refractive change. The 193-nm excimer laser is an effective new tool in the treatment of selected patients with superficial corneal opacity from a variety of conditions. 
1	Cutaneous manifestations of postthymic T cell malignancies: description of five clinicopathologic subtypes. This study was undertaken to identify the cutaneous manifestations among different prognostic subgroups of postthymic T cell malignancies. Cutaneous involvement was demonstrated in 43 of 88 cases. We recognized five clinicopathologic subtypes: type I, classical cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) or mycosis fungoides, six cases; type II, primary large cell type CTCL, Ki-1 antigen (Ki-1+ or Ki-1-), seven cases; type III, primary angioinvasive T cell lymphoma, three cases; type IV, human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I+) adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), eight cases; type V, secondary cutaneous involvement by peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTL), 19 cases. Primary CTCL and ATL tend to involve papillary dermis with or without epidermotropism, whereas PTL and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma predominantly affect skin adnexae, vessels, and subcutis. Cutaneous lesions in type V PTL are heterogeneous and may be confused with panniculitis, vasculitis, or an eczematous eruption. Classic CTCL, Ki-1+ lymphoma, and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma have a chronic course, whereas ATL, Ki-1- large cell lymphoma, and PTL are clinically aggressive. 
3	Bacterial meningitis: an update. Antibiotics and improvements in supportive care have greatly reduced the mortality from bacterial meningitis. Nevertheless, the incidence of neurodevelopmental sequelae remains unacceptably high. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol remain the standard for antimicrobial therapy against which other agents must be compared. A number of adjunct therapies are being investigated for their possible effectiveness in reducing hearing loss and other neurologic effects of this disease. There continues to be a need for carefully performed follow-up studies to assess any possible benefit of these agents. A significant percentage of children surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis have obvious or subtle neurodevelopmental deficits. The role of the pediatric neurologist should not end with management of acute problems such as seizures but should be expanded to aid in close developmental monitoring of these high-risk children. 
5	Local-regional breast cancer recurrence following mastectomy. Local-regional recurrence patterns were investigated in 1392 patients with breast cancer. Primary treatment for all patients included a mastectomy. Nine hundred seventeen patients had negative nodes and did not receive systemic therapy. Four hundred seventy-five patients had node metastases and were randomized to receive different combinations of chemoendocrine therapy. Follow-up ranged between 5 and 16 years. Two hundred thirty (25.8%) node-negative patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 9.2%. Two hundred forty-two (50.9%) node-positive patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 17.1%. Larger tumors and more extensive node involvement were associated with more first local-regional recurrences. The relative percent of first local-regional recurrence among patients in whom cancer recurred was similar for node-negative and node-positive patients (35.4% and 33.5%, respectively). In 63.6% of patients in whom cancer recurred, first local-regional recurrence were distant. Larger tumors, more extensive node involvement, and a shorter disease-free interval after mastectomy were associated with more rapid appearance of distant recurrence among these patients. 
1	Socioeconomic factors and cancer incidence among blacks and whites Findings from previous studies suggest that differences in socioeconomic status may be responsible for some, if not all, of the elevated incidence of cancer among blacks as compared with whites. Using incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we tested this hypothesis by correlating black and white cancer incidence rates in three US metropolitan areas between 1978 and 1982 with data from the 1980 census on socioeconomic status within individual census tracts. The study analyzed data on the incidence of cancer at all sites combined (greater than 100 cancer sites) and at seven major sites separately. As in other studies, income and educational levels served as surrogates for socioeconomic status. The present study also used census-tract data on population density as a surrogate factor. Each of these measures of socioeconomic status was analyzed independently. Before correlation with census-tract data, age-adjusted data on cancer incidence showed statistically significant elevated risks among blacks for cancer at all sites combined and at four of the seven separate sites; whites showed an elevated risk for cancer at two sites. Cancer at only one site, the colon, showed no significant association with race. When age-adjusted incidence data were correlated with socioeconomic status, the comparative black-white risks changed: Whites showed an elevated risk of cancer at all sites combined and at three of the seven separate sites; blacks maintained their elevated risk at three sites. These findings suggest that the disproportionate distribution of blacks at lower socioeconomic levels accounts for much of the excess cancer burden among blacks. They also suggest that for both blacks and whites unidentified racial factors, which may be either cultural or genetic and which are not closely linked to socioeconomic status, may play a role in the incidence of some cancers. 
2	Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. 
2	Plasma fatty acid profile in advanced cirrhosis: unsaturation deficit of lipid fractions. Fatty acid (FA) profile of plasma total lipids, phospholipids (PL), cholesteryl esters (CE), and triglycerides (TG) were measured in 101 patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and in 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma levels of lipidic phosphorus, esterified cholesterol, and TG also were measured, and the unsaturation index (UI) was calculated for each fraction. Total plasma concentrations of saturated FA, linoleate, and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were lower in cirrhotics than in controls. This profile was also found in plasma levels of PL- and CE-associated FA. No detectable amounts of C20:3n9 were found in cirrhotic patients. Percent FA distribution of lipid fractions showed a lower percentage of linoleate and PUFA and a higher relative amount of saturated and monoenoic FA in cirrhotics than in controls. As a consequence, the UI of PL and CE was diminished in liver cirrhosis. Linoleate and PUFA deficiency was more marked in CE than in PL, as shown by the number of patients with values below the 5th percentile of the control group, suggesting an attempt to maintain the unsaturation of PL as the most important component of cell membranes. Hepatic failure, poor essential FA intake, and malnutrition are some of the possible etiologic factors for PUFA deficiency in cirrhosis. Their relative contribution to plasma FA abnormalities, as well as the clinical and pathophysiological consequences of PUFA deficit in cirrhotic patients, requires further investigation. 
3	Reversible myopathy due to labetalol. A severe, generalized myopathy developed in 2 children treated with labetalol. An 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy demonstrated proximal weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase levels during labetalol therapy. Clinical improvement began immediately when labetalol administration was halted; muscle strength was normal within 2 months. Muscle biopsies were consistent with rhabdomyolysis. 
4	Long-term follow-up in patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen patients with coronary artery disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or no organic heart disease who presented with incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT) were studied and followed for a mean period of 51 +/- 35 months. In these patients the incessant VT included greater than or equal to 3 episodes of sustained VT at a rate of greater than or equal to 120 beats/min and frequent episodes of nonsustained VT over a 24-hour period. No patient had electrolyte disorder, prolonged QT interval, drug-induced arrhythmia or myocardial infarction less than 2 weeks old. Six patients died within 27 months of follow-up; 4 from sudden death and 2 from acute myocardial infarction. Three of the 11 surviving patients had remission of their VT within 1 week after the diagnosis of incessant VT. In 3 other patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued during follow-up because of adverse effects of the drugs or other medical reasons, 2 were found in remission. In the remaining 5 alive patients, deliberate attempts were made to discontinue the antiarrhythmic drugs; 4 of these patients were found in remission when the drugs were discontinued. Thus, 9 of these patients (53%) with incessant VT had remission over a mean follow-up of 55 +/- 34 months after discontinuation of the antiarrhythmic drugs. The probability of remission in patients surviving incessant VT warrants trials of discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs in these patients. 
4	Prehospital cardiac arrest: the impact of witnessed collapse and bystander CPR in a metropolitan EMS system with short response times. OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown initiation of bystander CPR to significantly improve survival from prehospital cardiac arrest. However, in emergency medical services (EMS) systems with very short response times, bystander CPR has not been shown to impact outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of bystander CPR on survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in such a system. DESIGN: Prehospital, hospital, and death certificate data from a medium-sized metropolitan area were retrospectively analyzed for adult, nontraumatic cardiac arrest during a 16-month period. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients met study criteria. One hundred ninety-five arrests (65.4%) were witnessed, and 103 (34.6%) were unwitnessed. Twenty-five witnessed victims (12.8%) were discharged alive, whereas no unwitnessed victims survived (P less than .001). Patients suffering a witnessed episode of ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT) were more likely to survive (21.9%) than were other patients (2.0%, P less than .0001). Among witnessed patients, initiation of bystander CPR was associated with a significant improvement in survival (20.0%) compared with the no-bystander CPR group (9.2%, P less than .05). Bystander CPR was also associated with improved outcome when witnessed patients with successful prehospital resuscitation were evaluated as a group; 18 had bystander CPR, of whom 13 (72.2%) survived compared with only 12 of 38 patients with no bystander CPR (31.6%, P less than .01). CONCLUSION: Our data revealed improved survival rates when bystander CPR was initiated on victims of witnessed cardiac arrest in an EMS system with short response times. 
2	Oral contraception in disease states. Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke. Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding. Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery. Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation. Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation. 
3	Local injection treatment of tennis elbow--hydrocortisone, triamcinolone and lignocaine compared. Corticosteroid injections are the mainstay of treating tennis elbow even though their effectiveness has not been well established by controlled studies. A survey of consultant rheumatologists confirmed a widespread preference for this treatment but they varied in their choice of steroid dose and preparation. We examined the value of some practices by comparing local injections of 2 ml 1% lignocaine with either 10 mg triamcinolone or 25 mg hydrocortisone made up to 2 ml with 1% lignocaine (Study 1). The investigation was conducted double blind. Within the first 8 weeks, pain relief was greater for triamcinolone than hydrocortisone although the differences were not statistically significant. The response to both steroid preparations was significantly better than for lignocaine up to this point but at 24 weeks, the degrees of improvement were similar for all three groups and many patients still had pain. Relapse was common. In a separate but similarly designed study, triamcinolone 10 mg was compared with 20 mg of the same agent. Improvements of pain were similar and followed the same time scale. Post-injection worsening of pain occurred in approximately half of all steroid treated patients in both studies and this was sometimes severe and persistent. It was less frequent amongst those given lignocaine alone. Skin atrophy was reported in all groups but was more frequent amongst those given triamcinolone in Study 1. In conclusion, more rapid relief of symptoms was achieved with 10 mg triamcinolone than with 25 mg hydrocortisone or lignocaine alone and there was less needed to repeat injections. Results obtained with 20 mg triamcinolone were similar to those of the smaller dose. 
4	A randomized double-blind crossover comparison of four rate-responsive pacing modes. The aim of this study was to compare, both subjectively and objectively, four modern rate-responsive pacing modes in a double-blind crossover design. Twenty-two patients, aged 18 to 81 years, had an activity-sensing dual chamber universal rate-responsive (DDDR) pacemaker implanted for treatment of high grade atrioventricular block and chronotropic incompetence. They were randomly programmed to VVIR (ventricular demand rate-responsive), DDIR (dual chamber demand rate-responsive), DDD (dual chamber universal) or DDDR (dual chamber universal rate-responsive) mode and assessed after 4 weeks of out-of-hospital activity. Five patients, all with VVIR pacing, requested early reprogramming. The DDDR mode was preferred by 59% of patients; the VVIR mode was the least acceptable mode in 73%. Perceived "general well-being," exercise capacity, functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the VVIR than in dual rate-responsive modes. Exercise treadmill time was longer in DDDR mode (p less than 0.01), but similar in all other modes. During standardized daily activities, heart rate in VVIR and DDIR modes underresponded to mental stress. All rate-augmented modes overresponded to staircase descent, whereas the DDD mode significantly underresponded to staircase ascent. Echocardiography revealed no difference in chamber dimensions, left ventricular fractional shortening or pulmonary artery pressure in any mode. Cardiac output was greater at rest in the dual modes than in the VVIR mode (p = 0.006) but was similar at 120 beats/min. Beat to beat variability of cardiac output was greatest in VVIR mode (p less than 0.0001), with DDIR showing greater variability than DDD or DDDR modes (p less than 0.05). Mitral regurgitation estimated by Doppler color flow imaging was similar in all modes, but tricuspid regurgitation was significantly greater in VVIR than in dual modes (p less than 0.03). Subjects who preferred the DDDR mode and those who found the VVIR mode least acceptable had significantly greater increases in stroke volume when paced in the DDD mode than in the ventricular-inhibited (VVI) mode at rest (22%) when compared with subjects who preferred other modes (2%, p = 0.03). No other objective variable was predictive of subjective benefit from any rate-responsive pacing mode. Thus, dual sensor rate-responsive pacing (DDDR) is superior objectively and subjectively to single sensor (VVIR, DDIR and DDD) pacing and subjective benefit from dual chamber rate-augmented pacing is predictable echocardiographically. 
5	A comparison of three formulations of TAC (tetracaine, adrenalin, cocaine) for anesthesia of minor lacerations in children. A randomized, prospective, double-blind study comparing three formulations of the topical anesthetic solution TAC for laceration repair was undertaken in 250 children. The children's wounds were anesthetized with either TAC I (original formulation--0.5% tetracaine, 1:2000 Adrenalin, 11.8% cocaine), TAC II (1.0% tetracaine, 1:4000 Adrenalin, 7.0% cocaine), or TAC III (1.0% tetracaine, 1:4000 Adrenalin, 4.0% cocaine) prior to repair. The solutions were compared with respect to efficacy, acceptability, wound complications, and side effects. We found comparable efficacy of the three formulations, with similar efficacy to 1% lidocaine infiltration for facial and scalp wounds. Anesthesia for extremity wounds was adequate in only 39.9% of cases, regardless of TAC strength. Wound complications and side effects were within expected and acceptable limits. Our findings support use of TAC for face and scalp lacerations and a change to a less concentrated TAC preparation, such as our "TAC III," which is presumably safer for widespread use. 
5	Secondary hypogonadism in hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a rare disorder of iron storage. This report illustrates a case of hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism in a female with biopsy-proven hemochromatosis. Dynamic pituitary and gonadal testing revealed subnormal gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) but normal ovarian reserve, as shown by normal follicular stimulation with hMG. Thus, abnormalities of ovulation and menstruation in patients with hemochromatosis are most likely because of inadequate pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. 
5	Schnitzler's syndrome: a broader clinical spectrum. Schnitzler's syndrome is characterized by chronic urticaria, recurrent fever, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy in conjunction with a serum IgM M component in a concentration that is usually less than 10,000 mg/L. Complement activation and cryoprecipitation do not appear to be involved. We report two additional patients who share many of the characteristics of this entity. These patients differ from patients previously reported because of the markedly elevated IgM M-component concentration in one patient and the severity of anemia in the second patient. An increased frequency of IgG autoantibodies to interleukin-1-alpha has been reported by other investigators; it has been suggested that an antibody-mediated prolongation of the half-life of interleukin-1-alpha might account for some of the symptoms and signs of this disorder. However, neither the mediators involved in the induction of nonpruritic urticaria nor the role of the IgM M component has been established. 
1	The use of a biodegradable mesh to prevent radiation-associated small-bowel injury. Radiation-associated small bowel injury occurs in up to 50% of patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy following pelvic cancer surgery. We describe our experience using a biodegradable mesh that allows the small bowel to be supported above the pelvic inlet and is totally absorbed following radiation therapy. Between 1985 and 1989, 45 procedures were performed in patients with carcinoma of the rectum (anterior resection in 15 patients, abdominoperineal resection in 23 patients, pelvic exenteration in six patients, and proctocolectomy in one patient). In 30 patients a polyglycolic acid (Dexon) mesh was used, and in 15 patients a polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) mesh was used. Forty-four patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The mean (+/- SEM) dose was 56.8 +/- 18.4 Gy. There were no immediate complications related to the mesh. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 53 months (median follow-up, 34 months). With the exception of two patients who had a polyglactin 910 mesh and who developed bowel obstruction due to adhesions under the anterior abdominal wall, there has been no documented incidence of clinical radiation-associated small bowel injury. The use of the absorbable mesh may permit us to use higher doses of postoperative radiotherapy without the associated hazard of radiation-associated small bowel injury. 
1	Colorectal cancer: differences between community and geographically distant patients seen at an urban medical center. Many studies in clinical oncology rely on hospital-derived patients. Hospitals vary in the proportions of patients from the local catchment area vs. those from more distant places, of whom a larger proportion are presumably referrals. To study the differences between these two types of patients, we analyzed 1,245 colorectal cancer patients seen at a large urban medical center over a seven-year period. Three hundred ninety-eight patients were from the local community (32 percent), 489 were from the extended community (39.3 percent), and 358 from more distant communities (28.8 percent). The patients from the local community tended to be older and from minority ethnic groups. In addition, the local community patients were more likely to have advanced disease at the time of presentation. The grade of the tumor and its site distribution within the large bowel were similar for the three groups. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and stage of disease, the survival was somewhat better for the distant community patients as compared with the local and extended communities (P less than 0.02). Overall, in our patient population, the distant patients tended to have more favorable socioeconomic factors and less advanced disease, and these differences may account, in large part, for a better prognosis for these patients. Particularly in large cooperative trials, studies may need to take into account the respective proportions of local community and geographically distant patients in analyzing and generalizing treatment outcomes. 
4	Evidence of an antiplatelet aggregation action of doxazosin in patients with hypertension: an ex vivo study. Eighteen patients with a mean age of 54.7 years were included in the study. All patients had a diagnosis of mild or moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure of 96 to 114 mm Hg). The study design was single blind and in two phases: phase I, placebo (4 weeks), and phase II, the active treatment (8 weeks) with increasing doses, if needed, of doxazosin every 2 weeks (1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/day). Results show that doxazosin has an antihypertensive effect that is dose dependent. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were decreased significantly, and no effect on heart rate was observed. Doxazosin significantly inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment with doxazosin lowered total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, without changing other standard biochemical parameters. This indicates that doxazosin could offer a distinct therapeutic advantage in the modulation of atherogenic and thromboembolic factors associated with coronary heart disease. 
5	The European experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A retrospective survey of 7 European centers involving 20 surgeons who undertook 1,236 laparoscopic cholecystectomies was performed. The procedure was completed in 1,191 patients. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary in 45 patients (3.6%) either because of technical difficulty (n = 33), the onset of complications (n = 11), or instrument failure (n = 1). There were no deaths reported, and the total postoperative complication rate was 20 of 1,203 (1.6%), with 9 being serious complications requiring laparotomy. The total incidence of bile duct damage was 4 of 1,203. The median hospital stay was 3 days (range: 1 to 27 days) and the median time to return to full activity after discharge was 11 days (range: 7 to 42 days). 
4	Delayed detection of coarctation in infancy: implications for timing of newborn follow-up. During a recent 5-year period, 74 patients younger than 6 months of age were diagnosed with coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation was correctly diagnosed in only 22% of patients prior to referral despite readily apparent femoral pulse abnormalities in 86%. Infants whose symptoms were detected between 5 and 14 days of age were significantly more ill than infants outside this age range and had a high mortality rate (25%). The number of associated cardiac defects was not related to the severity of clinical illness in this group, suggesting that closure of the ductus arteriosus is the primary determinate of disease severity. Observations in two patients suggested that a detectable pulse discrepancy occurs between 3 and 5 days postnatally. Upper extremity hypertension was found commonly in infants after 5 days of age despite the presence of congestive heart failure. Earlier detection of coarctation in the newborn requires a diligent cardiovascular and peripheral pulse examination between 3 and 7 days of life, upper extremity and lower extremity blood pressure measurement, and a high index of suspicion. 
1	Lung lobe torsion following lobectomy. Three cases of postoperative pulmonary lobe torsion were reported. Two of three showed hemorrhagic infarctions, and as a result underwent rethoracotomies and removal of the affected lobes. From these experiences, we consider that computed tomography (CT) and bronchofiberscopic examinations are useful for the diagnosis of advanced torsion. 
1	Insulin-like growth factor-II: possible local growth factor in pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas, neural crest tumors, express an abundance of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II). To assess further the potential for IGF-II to play an autocrine role for these tumors, we measured 1) IGF-II content by RRA in 7 pheochromocytomas and peripheral blood in these patients, 2) IGF-II receptors by Western analysis, and 3) characterized the tumor binding proteins by ligand blot studies. IGF-II levels in the tumors varied from 2.8-41 micrograms/g. Chromatography revealed that 60% of the peptide eluted as a large mol wt form of IGF-II (8.7-10 kDa); the remainder coeluted with mature peptide (7.5 kDa). This was in contrast to IGF-II levels in normal adrenal tissue (0.225 +/- 0.005 micrograms/g) or another neural crest-derived tumor, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (0.63 +/- 0.02 micrograms/g). Serum IGF-II levels in the 7 patients with pheochromocytoma (720 +/- 71 ng/mL) were similar to those in 35 normal controls (762 +/- 69 ng/mL). Radiolabeled IGF-II (9 +/- 1%) and IGF-I (20 +/- 2%) bound specifically to pheochromocytoma membranes. Western analysis of these membranes using a specific antiserum directed against the type II receptor demonstrated a band at 210 kDa. Affinity cross-linking studies with [125I]IGF-I demonstrated a specific band at 140 kDa. Ligand blot analysis was performed on the void volume pools from the Sephadex G-75 column and demonstrated bands at about 30 and 25 kDa. In conclusion, these data 1) confirm that pheochromocytomas have increased levels of IGF-II; 2) demonstrate that despite high IGF-II concentrations in the tumors, peripheral levels are not elevated, suggesting that very little tumoral IGF-II is released into the circulation, unlike catecholamines; 3) demonstrate the presence of IGF-II and IGF-I receptors; 4) describe binding protein species similar to those present in other tissues. Thus, the presence of high levels of IGF-II and both type I and type II receptors suggests that IGF II may act through both receptors to alter tumor growth. 
2	Congenital biliary tract disease. Jaundice in the pediatric patient requires prompt and directed evaluation. This dictum is highlighted in infants with biliary atresia, in whom the progressive sclerosing process results in complete obliteration of patent but microscopic hilar biliary structures by 4 months of age. Kasai's operation, if done before that time, will re-establish bile drainage in 90% of infants. One fourth to one third of patients achieve long-term jaundice-free survival. Complications of cholangitis, portal hypertension, and fat malabsorption are experienced by many patients. In children with early or late operative failure, liver replacement now offers legitimate hope for extended survival. Choledochal cyst is a conglomerate of pancreaticobiliary anomalies consisting of a choledochal cyst, a common-channel-type pancreaticobiliary junction, intrahepatic cystic disease, and partial obstruction of the distal common bile duct. Many patients have one or more of these malformations. It is now widely accepted that the preferred treatment of choledochal cyst is total excision of the diseased biliary duct with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. "Internal" excision avoids injury to other structures in the hepatoduodenal ligament, particularly if pericystic inflammation is present. Congenital perforation of the common bile duct responds in most cases to simple peritoneal drainage of the perforation. Retention of the tube cholecystostomy is useful for subsequent cholangiographic follow-up. Tube cholecystostomy may also be useful for irrigation of the biliary tract in infants with inspissated bile syndrome. 
1	Familial incidence of Paget's disease and secondary osteogenic sarcoma. A report of three cases from a single family. This report describes a family of three siblings with a long history of polyostotic Paget's disease. Because of the severe osseous involvement with Paget's disease, all three patients had problems that required orthopedic surgery. Subsequent to these surgeries, two patients developed osteogenic sarcoma at sites unrelated to their past procedures, one in the sacrum and one in the calvarium. Both patients died shortly after their diagnosis because of the aggressive spread of the tumor. Although the etiology of Paget's disease and its complication of osteogenic sarcoma still remain to be clarified, this and other case reports suggest a possible environmental or hereditary contribution to developing osteogenic sarcoma in Paget's disease. Patients with a familial clustering of polyostotic Paget's disease may benefit from more thorough screening tests to detect malignant transformation. 
4	Cocaine babies: the scourge of the '90s. Six cases of cocaine-related deaths of infants have covered the spectrum of potentially devastating effects. They include an intrauterine death of a 35-week-old fetus following acute maternal cocaine abuse; anoxic encephalopathy at birth with 3 months' vegetative survival from a similar episode; traumatic compression asphyxia in a 4-month-old; infectious cardiomyopathy with heart failure in a twin at age 21 months following maternal cocaine abuse at birth; malnutrition and dehydration in a 7-week-old during continuing cocaine abuse by the parents; and a teenage sibling's cocaine lacing of a baby milk bottle ingested by his 6-week-old brother. All the cases had positive toxicological screening for cocaine or metabolites or both in the mother at delivery or in the infant at birth, or both. There were no instances of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, or "crib death"). Pathologic and toxicologic, as well as birth, developmental, and social data are presented. An integrated medical, public health, law enforcement, and educational policy to prevent or at least ameliorate these tragic cases, now approaching epidemic proportions, has yet to be developed. A careful obstetrical history and examination of the mother, indication on the birth certificate of maternal drug abuse, and notification of health authorities (by birth certificate checking, among other ways) may send an early warning message to providers for intercession. Active ingestion/injection and passive inhalation by older children and teenagers require more intensive monitoring and aggressive interaction by pediatricians, social workers, school authorities, and employers. 
5	Monozygotic twins discordant for partial trisomy 1. A 25-year-old primigravida delivered monozygotic twins discordant for multiple anomalies and partial trisomy 1 mosaicism. The phenotype of partial trisomy 1 includes craniofacial, central nervous system, and ocular anomalies. The most likely explanation for these findings is that the translocation occurred after twinning occurred. This observation emphasizes that monozygotic twins are not necessarily genetically identical. They are identical at conception, but subsequent mutation and rearrangement of the genome may cause substantial phenotypic differences. 
4	Identification of acute myocardial infarction patients suitable for early hospital discharge after aggressive interventional therapy. Results from the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. BACKGROUND. Very early (day 4) hospital discharge has recently been proposed for selected patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine the most useful factors for identifying acute MI patients treated with aggressive interventional therapy who could be safely discharged on day 4. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 708 patients enrolled in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction trials I-III. Patients dying in the first 3 days and those with early (days 1-3) emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), late elective CABG (greater than or equal to day 4), or urgent/emergency CABG resulting from a late elective coronary angioplasty were excluded. The remaining 580 patients were randomly divided into a training sample (group 1) that was used to build a logistic regression model for predicting the absence of a late major complication and a test sample (group 2) that was used to validate this model. For this study, patients were considered appropriate for day 4 hospital discharge if they did not experience any of the following for 30 days after MI: death, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, sustained hypotension, sustained ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular block, acute ventricular septal defect, and recurrent ischemia necessitating urgent CABG. In group 1, four variables were independent predictors of freedom from late major complications: absence of early sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, absence of early sustained hypotension or cardiogenic shock, fewer coronary arteries with significant (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis, and a higher left ventricular ejection fraction. In group 2, 23% of patients had a logistic model prediction of a 3% or less chance of a late complication. These patients had no deaths or reinfarctions by day 30 and a 3% late major complication rate. CONCLUSIONS. The results of early cardiac catheterization and the absence of selected early (days 1-3) major complications do allow identification of a low risk subgroup of acute MI patients that may be suitable for very early discharge. 
4	Long-term cardiopulmonary bypass by peripheral cannulation in a model of total heart failure. The decompression of the left heart through a percutaneous helical spring positioned within the lumen of the tricuspid and pulmonary artery valves. We performed long-term closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass in an animal model of total heart failure (induced ventricular fibrillation). The extracorporeal system included a venous reservoir, a roller pump, a membrane lung, and a blood pulsator system. We cannulated the right external jugular vein for venous drainage and the right subclavian artery for arterial return. To decompress the left heart we passed by percutaneous cannulation a special helical spring mounted on a Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Edwards Divisions, Irvine, Calif.) and positioned it to rest within the pulmonary artery and tricuspid valves, which rendered them partly incompetent. After induced ventricular fibrillation, blood flow was raised to keep the central venous pressure at baseline values. The lungs were ventilated with 5% carbon dioxide in room air. During bypass, mean pulmonary artery pressure was 10.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, mean wedge pressure 11.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, and mean blood pressure 95.2 +/- 5.6 mm Hg. After 2 days (four animals) and 3 days (two animals) the hearts were defibrillated. There was immediate ejection from both sides of the heart. All sheep were weaned from bypass within 29 +/- 11 minutes and their lungs were ventilated with room air within 42 +/- 34 minutes. At autopsy hearts and lungs grossly appeared normal. We conclude that the percutaneous helical spring resting within right heart valves provided excellent decompression throughout the study, with full recovery of heart and lung function on defibrillation. 
2	Catecholamine regulation of adipocyte lipolysis after surgery. The effect of surgical trauma on the regulation of lipolysis was studied in isolated fat cells obtained before and 24 hours after elective cholecystectomy in 12 patients who were not obese and who were healthy otherwise. Surgery was accompanied by a twofold increase of the basal rate of lipolysis and by a significant 50% elevation of the lipolytic effect of catecholamines. The actions of various agents that selectively stimulate lipolysis at different early or late steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system beyond the adrenoreceptors were also increased about 50% after surgery (p less than 0.01). The properties of the beta-adrenoceptors were not altered by surgery, as assessed by radioligand binding and isoprenaline sensitivity. The antilipolytic properties of catecholamines (mediated by alpha 2-adrenoreceptors) were not influenced by cholecystectomy. Lipolysis was not altered in four subjects who had no surgery and who served as control subjects 24 hours after being given the same type of postoperative nutrition as patients who underwent cholecystectomy. We concluded that moderate surgical trauma is associated with increased lipolytic activity of fat cells. This is secondary to an enhanced ability of catecholamines to stimulate lipolysis because of a modification at the most distal steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system, which may involve the protein kinase/hormone sensitive lipase complex. 
5	Surgery for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystostomy and cholecystectomy remain appropriate and effective therapy for acute and chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy is the gold standard against which all alternative methods of treatment of inflammatory biliary stone disease should be judged. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of acute and chronic cholecystitis have been described. Techniques of cholecystostomy, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative cholangiography used by the author have been given. Our results and those generally described in the literature indicate that the overall mortality rate for cholecystectomy, in all age groups, is approximately 0.5%. This rate increases slightly in patients with acute cholecystitis and in those over the age of 65 years. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective and the definitive treatment for acute and chronic cholecystitis. 
5	A method for performing full-thickness, orthotopic, penetrating keratoplasty in the mouse. In an attempt to overcome the lack of well characterized, inbred, and congenic strains, as well as a paucity of immunological reagents, in rabbit and rat models, we have developed a procedure for performing full-thickness, penetrating keratoplasty in the mouse. One hundred percent of isografts (BALB/c onto BALB/c) were successful, while 83.3% of allografts (C3H onto BALB/c) failed. The use of a mouse model to study corneal graft failure will allow a critical evaluation of the role of a variety of immunological mediators in causing graft failure. 
5	Effect of antiarrhythmic therapy on mortality in survivors of myocardial infarction with asymptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias: Basel Antiarrhythmic Study of Infarct Survival (BASIS) In view of the high risk of sudden cardiac death and the prognostic importance of complex ventricular ectopic activity, the effects of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment were investigated prospectively in patients with persisting asymptomatic complex arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. End points were total mortality and arrhythmic events (sudden death, sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). Of 1,220 consecutively screened survivors of myocardial infarction, 312 had Lown class 3 or 4b arrhythmia on 24 h electrocardiographic recordings before hospital discharge and consented to the study. They were randomized to individualized antiarrhythmic treatment (Group 1, n = 100), treatment with low dose amiodarone, 200 mg/day (Group 2, n = 98) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (Group 3 [control group], n = 114). During the 1 year follow-up period, 10 patients in Group 1 died, as did 5 in Group 2 and 15 in Group 3. On the basis of an intention to treat analysis, the probability of survival of patients given amiodarone was significantly greater than that of control patients (p less than 0.05). In addition, arrhythmic events were significantly reduced by amiodarone (p less than 0.01). These effects were less marked and not significant for individually treated patients (Group 1). These findings suggest that low dose amiodarone decreases mortality in the 1st year after myocardial infarction in patients at high risk of sudden death. 
5	Prostatic urethra dilatation with the Gianturco self-expanding metallic stent: a feasibility study in cadaver specimens and dogs. In an effort to develop a transcatheter technique for dilatation of the prostatic urethra without the use of balloons, the feasibility of using Gianturco self-expanding stents was evaluated. Initially, eight human cadaveric prostatic urethras were stented to evaluate the ability of the stent to dilate the lumen. In all cases, the device attained its unconstrained diameter immediately on placement. Subsequently, stents were placed in the prostatic urethra of 12 dogs and followed up for 1 month (four dogs), 3 months (one dog), and 6 months (seven dogs). Five bare straight-end prostheses, one nylon-covered straight-end device, and six flared-end stents were used. Three of the bare straight-end stents migrated during the follow-up, whereas the nylon-covered and flared-end stents did not. Stent diameters greater than 1.3 times the urethral diameter caused moderate to marked edema and inflammation. After 6 months, white deposits were found on the solder points, presumably from electrolysis. Our experience suggests that placement of Gianturco self-expanding stents may be a useful method of dilating and maintaining the luminal diameter of the prostatic urethra, although care must be taken to select the proper stent size. 
5	Small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma (undifferentiated lymphoma, Burkitt's type) in American adults: results with treatment designed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PURPOSE: Small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma (SNCL) "Burkitt's type," a rapidly growing lymphoma, has been rare among adults in the United States, but has greatly increased in incidence with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. This report details the results of treatment of adult SNCL with a series of protocols originally designed for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1973 and May 1987, 29 adults with newly diagnosed SNCL were treated at Memorial Hospital with intensive chemotherapy originally designed for ALL: the cyclophosphamide L-2, L-10, L-17, and L-20 protocols. Nine patients had positive serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One patient with all measurable disease resected was not evaluable for response. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 evaluable patients (57%) achieved a complete remission with treatment. With follow-up as long as 153 months (median, 47 months), 50% of all patients and 59% of patients with negative or unknown HIV serologies have survived and are probably cured. Patients with an initial serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level of greater than 500 U/L had a significantly shortened survival as compared with those with a lower serum LDH. Other pretreatment patient characteristics associated with a shortened survival of borderline statistical significance were high National Cancer Institute stage (C, D) and bone marrow involvement. These results are similar to those for ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma and are comparable to those for American SNCL in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one half of adults with SNCL are curable with intensive chemotherapy. More intensive chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor and/or autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell support may increase curability. 
3	Maximal exercise testing of mentally retarded adolescents and adults: reliability study. Few data are available regarding maximal exercise testing of mentally retarded individuals. No data are available on the reliability of maximal exercise testing of mentally retarded individuals. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of graded exercise testing of mentally retarded adolescents and adults. The testing was conducted at two geographically different centers. At Center A, 14 mentally retarded adolescents (11 boys, three girls) with Down syndrome, who were educable or trainable, were recruited from a nonresidential school. The subjects completed two Balke-Ware treadmill protocols until exhaustion. The treadmill time and heart rate (HR) were recorded. The time between tests was approximately one week. At Center B, 21 mentally retarded adults (14 women, seven men means IQ = 56) were recruited from local workshops and group homes. These subjects completed a treadmill walking protocol, with metabolic measurements, until exhaustion. The time between tests varied from one to four months. At Center A, the subjects achieved a mean treadmill time of 8.72min on test one and 8.84min on test two (means HR = 174 and 175bpm, respectively). The reliability coefficient between the two tests was .94. At Center B, the subjects achieved a mean V0(2)max of 27.2mL.kg-1.min-1 on test one and 26.9mL.kg-1.min-1 on test two. The reliability coefficient was .93. These data show that maximal exercise testing is reliable for these populations of mentally retarded individuals, exhibiting similar values to their nonretarded peers. 
4	Technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial imaging: same-day rest-stress studies and dipyridamole. Unlike thallium-201, technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi does not redistribute in the myocardium after injection. Thus, 2 separate injections, 1 at rest and the other at stress (or after dipyridamole), are required to differentiate ischemia from scar. From a physical viewpoint, a 24-hour interval between the 2 injections is preferable for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) with Tc-99m sestamibi imaging. However, same-day studies are more convenient in clinical practice. Results of studies using different Tc-99m sestamibi injection protocols are presented with emphasis on the advantages of a rest-stress injection sequence with a low dose at rest (7 mCi) followed 2 hours later by a higher dose at stress (25 mCi). A prospective study was conducted in a patient population with proven CAD using same-day studies to compare a rest-stress (7 and 25 mCi, respectively) to a stress-rest (7 and 25 mCi) Tc-99m sestamibi injection sequence. There was an agreement in 87.3% of the analyzed segments between the 2 protocols. However, the largest discordance for type of defect applied to 7.4% of the segments judged ischemic in the rest-stress protocol, which were called scars on stress-rest. This study showed that a rest-stress sequence is preferable when using a same-day protocol with a short time interval (less than 2 hours) between the 2 Tc-99m sestamibi injections because the rest image performed initially represents a "true" rest study, which is not necessarily the case with the stress-rest sequence. Preliminary studies were performed to evaluate dipyridamole with Tc-99m sestamibi imaging in normal subjects and in patients with CAD. These studies showed that treadmill and dipyridamole Tc-99m sestamibi imaging are comparable and the results are similar to those obtained with thallium-201. 
3	Special considerations for research with pharmacologic agents. As physical medicine and rehabilitation becomes more and more complicated, the medical rehabilitation research teams are often bewildered by the sweeping changes occurring in the application of therapeutic drugs for rehabilitation. Society, through the instrument of governmental regulations, dictates that all new treatments must be efficacious before "release.". 
4	Myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction associated with interleukin-2 therapy for cancer. The hearts of eight patients aged 22 to 67 years (mean, 41 years) who died during or within 4 days of interleukin-2 (IL-2) based immunotherapy for treatment of renal cell carcinoma or melanoma were studied at necropsy. Death resulted from combined cardiorespiratory failure in two patients, sepsis in four patients, acute myocardial infarction in one patient, and myocarditis in one patient. Transmural left ventricular necrosis was present in one of the two patients with significant atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing. Noninfectious myocarditis was present in five patients: the inflammatory infiltrate was lymphocytic in four and composed of a mixture of eosinophils and lymphocytes in one. Although treatment-related deaths associated with high-dose IL-2 therapy are uncommon (1.5% in 652 consecutive patients), the potential for significant myocardial ischemia or myocarditis exists, and careful monitoring for arrhythmias or myocardial failure is warranted. 
1	Transforming growth factor beta stimulates mammary adenocarcinoma cell invasion and metastatic potential. The experimental metastatic potential of 13762NF mammary adenocarcinoma clone MTLn3 was tested after pretreatment in serum-free medium containing transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 at 0-5000 pg/ml. Lung colonies were measured 2 weeks after inoculation in syngeneic F344 rats, and a bell-shaped dose-response curve with 2- to 3-fold increase in number of surface lung metastases was seen. Maximal enhancement occurred at the 50 pg/ml dose level. The effect was specific because addition of neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody blocked the stimulatory activity at all levels of TGF-beta 1 pretreatment, but when antibody was given alone, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody had no effect on untreated cells. Increased metastatic potential appears to be from an increased propensity of cells to extravasate as tested in the membrane invasion culture system. MTLn3 cells penetrated reconstituted basement-membrane barriers 2- to 3.5-fold more than did untreated control cells, depending upon length of TGF-beta 1 exposure. Increased invasive potential is apparently due, in part, to a 2- to 6-fold increase in type IV collagenolytic (gelatinolytic) and a 2.4-fold increase in heparanase activity. TGF-beta 1 treatment of MTLn3 cells did not alter their growth rate or morphology in the presence of serum; however, growth was inhibited in serum-free medium. Likewise, adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers or to immobilized reconstituted basement membrane or fibronectin matrices was unchanged. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 may modulate metastatic potential of mammary tumor cells by controlling their ability to break down and penetrate basement-membrane barriers. 
2	Expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules by mucosal mononuclear phagocytes in inflammatory bowel disease. Leukocyte adhesion molecules are important in cell-cell interactions of the immune system. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (cluster designation 11a) mediates interactions between T cells and mononuclear phagocytes through its ligand, the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54), whereas complement receptors 3 (CD 11b) and 4 (CD11c) are involved in complement-mediated phagocytosis. Expression of CD11 molecules and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was studied in colonic biopsy specimens from 20 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 10 normal controls. In normal colon, few mononuclear phagocytes expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 at high densities. The major adhesion molecule was CD11c. Thus, the largest population of normal colonic mononuclear phagocytes was represented by quiescent, resident macrophages with likely phagocytic function. In inflammatory bowel disease, mononuclear phagocytes showed only a slight increase in CD11a expression and no significant change in expression of CD11b and CD11c. By contrast, the percentage of mononuclear phagocytes expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was increased from 6.9% +/- 3.9% in controls to 69.2% +/- 12.8% in ulcerative colitis (P less than 0.001) and to 45.7% +/- 22.8% in Crohn's disease (P less than 0.01), showing a close relationship with histological activity. The increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in inflammatory bowel disease indicates a state of immunological activation induced by local release of inflammatory cytokines. Such induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on mononuclear phagocytes may be important in the maintenance of chronic inflammation by facilitating interactions with T cells and T-cell antigen recognition. 
1	Murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody as a potential network antigen for human carcinoembryonic antigen. Carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract are not curable by standard therapies. Thus, new therapeutic approaches for this disease are needed. This study proposes the use of anti-Id mAb as Ag substitutes to induce anti-tumor immunity in gastrointestinal cancer patients. Recently, we have generated and characterized one monoclonal anti-Id antibody, designated 3H1 (Ab2), which mimics biologically and antigenically a distinct and specific epitope of the 180,000 m.w. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) primarily expressed in high density by human pancreatic and colonic tumor cells. This epitope is unique to CEA and not present on other CEA-related lower m.w. members of the Ag family also found on normal tissues. The antigenic determinant as defined by the mAb 8019 (Ab1) against which the Ab2, 3H1 was raised, is absent on normal adult tissues by immunoperoxidase staining and haematopoietic cells including granulocytes by flow cytometry analysis. Anti-Id (Ab2) 3H1 induced CEA-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits. The immune sera from both mice and rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T and inhibited the binding of radioiodinated Ab1 to Ab2. This indicates that anti-anti-Id (Ab3) in mice and rabbits share idiotopes with Ab1 (8019). Furthermore, monoclonal Ab3 that bind to CEA have been generated from mice immunized with 3H1. The Ab3 (both polyclonal as well as monoclonal) immunoprecipitated the same 180,000 m.w. CEA as Ab1 (8019) by Western blotting analysis and showed almost identical immuno-staining patterns as Ab1 on colonic adenocarcinoma tissue sections from several patients. Collectively these data suggest that Ab2 3H1 could potentially be used clinically as a network Ag for immunotherapy of patients with CEA positive tumors. 
1	Performance and prognosis in patients with lung cancer. The Edinburgh Lung Cancer Group. The Edinburgh Lung Cancer Group prospectively registered 651 new patients presenting with lung cancer during 1981; only 47 survived five years (7%). The survival rate was highest in patients selected for surgery (35/116, 30%) and in this group was related to cell type, stage of disease, and possibly to Karnofsky performance score (not statistically significant). By comparison with non-surgical patients these 116 patients undergoing surgery were highly selected in terms of age, favourable histological type, stage of disease, and performance score. Forty-two of the 535 non-surgical patients were given radical radiotherapy alone and seven (17%) survived five years. The remaining 493 received palliative radiotherapy, chemotherapy (alone or combined with radiotherapy), or symptomatic treatment alone; only five (1%) survived five years. Median survival was related to cell type (adenocarcinoma 2.6 months, squamous cell carcinoma 6.2 months), stage (stage I 8.5 months, stage III 4 months), and Karnofsky performance index (greater than or equal to 90 9.3 months, less than or equal to 50 1.2 months). Age and sex had no independent prognostic value in any group. Performance score was highly correlated with stage (and age) and in this study represented the "best prognostic factor" in clinical practice. 
5	Efficacy and morbidity of partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. In recent years, we have seen increasing use of partial laryngectomies for larger lesions that were previously treated by total laryngectomy. The resultant closer margins have made postoperative radiation therapy an important adjuvant treatment to conservation laryngeal surgery. We review the University of California, Los Angeles, experience with combination partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy between 1973 and 1987 for treatment of carcinoma of the larynx. Twenty-four such patients who underwent partial laryngectomies and postoperative radiation therapy are examined. Techniques of treatment, complications, and the functional ability of the remaining larynx are discussed. The locoregional control rate at 5 years was 80%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence were positive margins, vascular invasion, and extranodal spread. There were no major problems with postoperative wound healing or airway management during the radiation treatment. Vocal and swallowing function were well preserved in most cases. We conclude that combination partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy permits preservation of laryngeal function without serious complications, and therefore is an effective treatment for selected patients with carcinoma of the larynx. 
1	Tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis (epiloia, Bourneville-Pringle syndrome) is an inherited disease with an autosomal pattern. Both sexes are affected equally with varied expression in successive generations. Two cases of this unusual disorder in siblings are reported. They illustrate heredofamilial nature, dissimilar expression, mutations, and oral manifestations. 
4	Sepsis-related cardiogenic shock. To further define cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with septic shock, serial conventional hemodynamic measurements combined with two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed at the bedside in 21 patients admitted for an acute episode of sepsis-related circulatory failure. Measurements obtained during the first hours of hospitalization revealed a group of six patients (group 1) with markedly depressed left ventricular function, as evidenced by a low cardiac index (CI) (2.2 +/- 0.8 L/min.m2), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (21 +/- 8%), and an increased arterial-venous oxygen content difference. Right ventricular systolic function was also severely depressed. These patients were characterized as having sepsis-related cardiogenic shock secondary to profound myocardial depression, which was reversible within 24 to 48 h with inotropic support. The 15 remaining patients (group 2) exhibited an initially increased CI (4.9 +/- 1.8 L/min.m2), with a low systemic vascular resistance. In group 2, LVEF remained within the normal range despite abnormally low peripheral vascular resistance. This finding would suggest the presence of slight to moderate depression of left ventricular systolic function. All patients in this series had a normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume, whether profound myocardial depression was present or not. 
4	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of intraluminal ultrasound in normal and atherosclerotic arteries. This study evaluated the dimensional and morphologic precision of arterial images obtained using intraluminal rotating A-scan ultrasound catheters [5.0F (30 mHz) and 8.0F (20 mHz)]. Dimensions of in vitro ultrasound images from human arteries (eight normal and nine arteriosclerotic) were compared with those from histologic sections of the vessels. In addition, in vivo ultrasound studies (23 normal and 22 arteriosclerotic) of canine femoral arteries were compared with luminal dimensions obtained from angiograms of the vessels. The correlation of in vitro ultrasound images to luminal diameters (n = 22, r = 0.96), adventitial diameters (n = 19, r = 0.83), and wall thickness (n = 19, r = 0.68) in normal human vessels was significant (p less than 0.05). In vitro measurements of images and histologic specimens from human atherosclerotic arteries also correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with luminal diameters (n = 27, r = 0.91), adventitial diameters (n = 24, r = 0.60), and wall thickness (n = 24, r = 0.62). Morphologically, in vitro images of the wall of normal human arteries had a concentric laminated appearance and atherosclerotic vessels had patchy echodense and echolucent areas. In vivo studies showed significant correlation of diameters for both normal (n = 16, r = 0.91, p less than 0.05) and arteriosclerotic (n = 16, r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) canine arteries compared with luminal dimensions measured from uniplanar angiograms. We conclude that rotating A-scan intraluminal ultrasound accurately defines both normal and atherosclerotic arterial wall morphology and dimensions. This technology may be valuable for intravascular guidance of angioplasty devices by identifying the location and consistency of lesions. 
4	Valve and great vessel stenosis: assessment with MR jet velocity mapping. For measurement of poststenotic jet velocities with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors reduced the echo time (TE) of the field even-echo rephasing (FEER) velocity mapping sequence from 14.0 to 3.6 msec, so minimizing the problem of MR signal loss from turbulent fluid. In vitro use of rotating disk and stenotic flow phantoms confirmed that the 3.6-msec TE sequence enables accurate measurement of jet velocities of up to 6.0 m/sec (r = .996). Peak jet velocity measurements were made with MR imaging in 36 patients with stenosis of native heart valves (n = 9), conduits (n = 19), or Fontan connections (n = 2) or with aortic coarctation (n = 6). Peak velocity measurements made with MR imaging agreed well with measurements made with Doppler ultrasound (US), which were available in 18 cases (standard deviation = 0.2 m/sec). Velocity mapping with fast-echo MR imaging is likely to have considerable importance as a noninvasive means of locating and evaluating stenoses, particularly at sites inaccessible to US, but care must be taken to prevent errors caused by malalignment, signal loss, phase wrap, or partial-volume effects. 
1	Radionuclide imaging in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Radionuclide imaging provides both qualitative and quantitative information that can have dramatic effects on patient management in diseases of the head and neck. The general concepts of nuclear medicine imaging, including radiopharmaceuticals and radiation effects, are discussed. The principles and techniques of thyroid, parathyroid, bone, and salivary radionuclide imaging studies will be reviewed. The intent of this article is to provide a concise and current review of head and neck radionuclide imaging that will be useful in the day-to-day practice of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. 
5	Detection of gastric erosions: comparison of biphasic radiography with fiberoptic endoscopy. Biphasic radiography was compared with fiberoptic endoscopy in detecting gastric erosions in a prospective, blinded study of 385 patients with dyspepsia. Because no absolute standard was available for the comparison, since histologic confirmation of all erosions was not possible, the kappa statistic was used to compare results from both modalities. Flat (incomplete) erosions were detected with endoscopy only and were considered to be present in 42 patients (11.2%). Varioliform (complete) erosions were identified with both radiography and endoscopy in 12 patients (3.2%). For the detection of varioliform erosions, a substantial agreement beyond chance between both modalities was found (kappa = 0.73; standard error, 0.12). Thus, flat erosions were detected with endoscopy only, whereas state-of-the-art radiography and endoscopy were equally sensitive for detecting varioliform erosions. Histologic confirmation of erosions was obtained in only 75% of the patients. It is unknown whether the demonstration of erosions with radiography and/or endoscopy correlates with dyspepsia. 
5	Is caffeine withdrawal the mechanism of postoperative headache? This study examined the hypothesis that headache after general anesthesia is related to a caffeine withdrawal state. Two hundred eighty-seven patients undergoing minor elective procedures under general anesthesia were studied. Four to six hours after anesthesia each patient completed a questionnaire assessing his or her own alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption, and the occurrence of postoperative side effects. A highly significant difference was found between the caffeine consumption of patients with and without preoperative (P = 0.0035) and postoperative (P less than 0.0001) headache. Logistic regression analysis of trend between headache and caffeine consumption suggested that with each 100-mg increase in caffeine consumption, there was a 12% increase in the odds of headache developing in the immediate preoperative period (P less than 0.0066) and a 16% increase in the odds of postoperative headache developing (P less than 0.0001). No relationship was found between headache and the patients' age, sex, usual frequency of headache, consumption of alcohol or nicotine, or the anesthetic agents or adjuvants used. It is concluded that postoperative headache is related to caffeine intake and that this relationship is explained, at least in part, by a perioperative caffeine withdrawal syndrome. 
5	Management of gastroenteritis. Childhood gastroenteritis remains a common reason for admission to British paediatric units, although the severity of the disease appears to be diminishing in recent years. We studied 215 infants and children with gastroenteritis admitted consecutively to four paediatric units in South Wales in order to determine the severity of the disease, the organisms isolated, the frequency of complications, and the adequacy of management before admission. Stool pathogens were isolated in 125 (58%) patients (viruses in 65, bacteria in 30, and protozoa in 19, with multiple infection found in 11). There was a low incidence of morbidity and complications, but prolonged diarrhoea (postenteritis syndrome) was present in 24 (11%) cases and 77 (36%) had received inappropriate treatment before admission. Contemporary gastroenteritis is thus a relatively mild disease in the acute phase, but management before admission to hospital is often inadequate, and prolonged diarrhoea may be a feature in a considerable number of cases. 
4	Oral labetalol in hypertensive urgencies. The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented. After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol. Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg. The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg. Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol. Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control. Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg. 
5	Oxidative damage to lipids within the inflamed human joint provides evidence of radical-mediated hypoxic-reperfusion injury. Previous work has established the existence of a pathophysiological environment within the inflamed human joint, capable of sustaining a hypoxic-reperfusion event. Using four different assay systems (two standard and two novel) applied to synovial fluid for the assessment of lipid peroxidation, a series of studies demonstrate that exercise of the inflamed human knee promotes radical-mediated lipid peroxidation within the joint. The implication for novel antioxidant therapeutic approaches to inflammatory joint disease is discussed. 
5	Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis in two neutropenic patients. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon, self-limited dermatosis with a variable clinical presentation. It seems to be due to chemotherapeutic drugs in most cases. Necrosis of the eccrine gland associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate is the histologic hallmark of this disease. We report two additional cases in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in which there was a striking lack of neutrophil infiltration. A new term, drug-associated eccrine hidradenitis, is suggested. 
4	The natural history of thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia. Sixty-one of 375 women with hypertension and preeclampsia in a 48-month period had thrombocytopenia. By postpartum day 3, 90% of these women had rising platelet counts, and by day 4, 59 of 61 women had counts greater than 100,000/mm3. The two exceptions had other pathologic conditions in addition to preeclampsia. Thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia should resolve by postpartum day 4. 
4	Clinical performance of St. Jude and Medtronic-Hall prostheses: a randomized comparative study. Newer and improved models of mechanical prostheses are regularly added to surgeons' armamentarium. This study was designed to compare the clinical performance of two of the most used current models of mechanical prostheses. From August 1983 through July 1985, 182 white patients were prospectively randomized to implantation of the St. Jude Medical (95 patients) or Medtronic-Hall (87 patients) prostheses. There were 84 mitral, 85 aortic, and 13 double (mitral and aortic) valve replacements. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to sex distribution, age, functional class, emergency operation, and site of implantation. Early mortality was 3.2% for patients with the St. Jude valve and 5.7% for those with the Medtronic-Hall (p = NS). The survivors were followed for 3 to 5 years (mean, 4.2 +/- 0.6 years; cumulative follow-up, 559 patient-years). Late mortality was 7.1%/patient-year for the St. Jude group and 3.2%/patient-year for the Medtronic-Hall group (p less than 0.05). However, the valve-related mortality was equal (1.4%/patient-year) for both groups. Noncardiac causes accounted for most of the difference between the St. Jude and Medtronic-Hall groups (2.5%/patient-year and 0.4%/patient-year, respectively). There were no cases of thrombotic obstruction, whereas serious systemic thromboembolism occurred at the rate of 1.8%/patient-year (5 episodes) for the St. Jude group and 2.5%/patient-year (7 episodes) for the Medtronic-Hall group (p = not significant); there were another nine episodes of systemic embolism that left no sequelae. Three patients (St. Jude, 2; Medtronic-Hall, 1), all of whom had aortic valve replacement, required reoperation (0.5%/patient-year) because of prosthetic endocarditis, with two deaths. 
1	Abnormal epidermal changes after argon laser treatment. A 26-year-old woman with a congenital port-wine stain on the forehead was treated three times at 2-month intervals with an argon laser. Six months after the last treatment, moderate blanching and mild scaling confined to the treated area was observed. A biopsy specimen of the treated area revealed a significant decrease in ectatic vessels. However, epidermal changes similar to those of actinic keratosis with disorganized cell layers and marked cytologic abnormalities were seen. Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes for a defect in DNA repair was negative. Multiple, argon laser-induced photothermal effects may be responsible for the changes observed in our case and may lead to premalignant epidermal transformation. 
2	Physicochemical determinants of in vitro shock-wave biliary lithotripsy. Human gallstones were studied by visual inspection, computerized tomographic imaging, and chemical analysis to assess physicochemical characteristics that may determine the outcome of in vitro shock-wave fragmentation. Eighty-five stones (mean diameter: 13.2 +/- 5 mm) were each collected from different patients. Fifty-five (65%) calculi were angular and 30 (35%) round or oval-shaped. Three easily obtained measures were derived from each stone's optimal computerized tomographic image including the mean stone density, a measure corresponding to the standard deviation of the mean stone density value which we termed the stone density distribution index and which may reflect the physicochemical heterogeneity of a given gallstone, as well as the density range. After the administration of 2500 shock waves using an electrohydraulic generator, fragmentation was noted in 68 calculi (80%) and was satisfactory in 27 (32%) (where the largest resulting fragment diameters were all less than or equal to 5 mm). Strong determinants of satisfactory fragmentation on multivariate analysis included a stone diameter of less than or equal to 15 mm, the presence of an angular stone shape, and a stone density distribution index of greater than or equal to 60 Hounsfield units. The other parameters did not independently determine satisfactory fragmentation. Prospective clinical trials are needed to assess whether these findings result in a better prediction of the success of extracorporeal biliary lithotripsy and a broadening of its indications. 
1	Anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody and etoposide/cytosine arabinoside combinations for the ex vivo purification of bone marrow in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Pharmacologic and immunologic methods of ex-vivo bone marrow (BM) purging for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were combined to augment the effect of either method alone. Etoposide (VP16; 20 to 30 micrograms/mL) with or without cytosine arabinoside (Ara C; 10 mg/mL) was used in tandem with the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), MY9, chosen because CD33 is found on the stem cell pool in the majority of patients with ANLL. The agents were tested singly or sequentially, with a 1-hour incubation of the drugs preceding complement-mediated lysis using MY9. VP16 combined with Ara C killed up to 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 5.11 +/- 0.4 logs of the human ANLL cell lines HL60 and K562 at drug concentrations that killed only 1.2 +/- 0.1 logs of normal committed granulocyte/macrophage stem cells (CFU-GM). Adding a single exposure of the MY9 and complement (C') to the drug-treated cells, greater than 5.4 logs of HL60 were killed. Similar to other pharmacologic agents, no differential kill for clonagenic leukemic cells (colony-forming unit-leukemia; CFU-L) from patients with ANLL was seen for drug only treated blasts versus normal CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), with less than 1 log CFU-L kill at drug concentrations that spared 1 log of CFU-GM. Similarly, only 1.1 +/- 0.3 logs of ANLL CFU-L were eliminated using MY9 and C'. However, with the sequential VP16/Ara C----MY9 + C' treatment, synergy was demonstrated and 2.6 +/- 0.3 logs of CFU-L were eliminated. Because CD33 is also found on the normal CFU-GM pool, two-stage long-term BM cultures were performed to determine pluripotent stem cell elimination by the drug/MoAb purging combination. No difference of CFU-GM or BFU-E production at 4 to 6 weeks of culture for VP16/Ara C, MY9 + C', or VP16/AraC----My9 + C' treated cells was seen compared with untreated controls indicating sparing of early progenitor cells. Sequential ex vivo treatment of human ANLL CFU-L with VP16/Ara C followed by complement-mediated lysis using MY9 synergistically kills CFU-L while sparing early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and thus may be a more effective way to purge BM than either alone. 
1	Prognostic indicators in invasive breast cancer. Tumor size and axillary lymph node involvement are the primary determinants of clinical course for most patients. Receptors for estrogen and progesterone are important additional prognostic factors for disease-free survival, overall survival, survival time after initial disease recurrence, and the likelihood of response to hormonal therapy. Histologic grading has merit as a prognostic factor, although poor reproducibility limits its broad application. Promising data have been emerging from the use of flow cytometry to analyze DNA content and proliferative rate. Patients with aneuploid tumors are more likely to have a shorter survival time than patients with diploid tumors. A high S-phase fraction also identifies a subset of patients at increased risk for early relapse. A combined index of ploidy and S-phase may be a more useful guide; together, diploidy and low S-phase identify a subgroup of node-negative patients at very low risk for disease recurrence. A number of oncogenes have been identified in breast cancer; amplification of the HER-2/neu gene or overexpression of the gene product may be an important prognostic indicator for node-positive patients. 
2	Microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis with special reference to its application in diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia. The deoxyribonucleic (DNA) content was measured by microspectrophotometry in 100 specimens from 60 patients with ulcerative colitis, including six patients in whom the colitis was associated with carcinoma. Some 23 of 30 (77%) specimens of dysplastic tissue showed aneuploidy or polyploidy, whereas 50 of 53 (94%) specimens of non-dysplastic tissue showed diploidy. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Polyploidy was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had carcinoma or dysplasia. In the non-dysplastic patients all samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy. Some 10% of samples without inflammation, however, also showed polyploidy. A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of dysplasia. Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis and could be considered for screening high risk patients. 
5	Simplified hepatic resection with the use of prolonged vascular inflow occlusion. Ten consecutive patients scheduled to undergo liver resection were studied prospectively with the use of a standard protocol, which included routine vascular inflow occlusion to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Fibrin sealant was sprayed on the raw liver surface, and abdominal drainage was not performed. No deaths occurred, and the postoperative course was remarkably smooth. The normothermic liver ischemic times of 30 to 122 minutes (mean, 73 minutes) were well tolerated. The amount of blood transfused was reduced to a mean of 2 U (range, 0 to 4 U). The occurrence of infected intraabdominal bile collections in two patients with preexisting biliary tract infection suggested that abdominal drainage should be performed in such patients. Vascular inflow occlusion is recommended for all liver resections. 
1	The role of the chest roentgenogram in febrile neutropenic patients. In a retrospective review of patients with neutropenia and fever, we sought to determine how often roentgenograms detected pulmonary disease, especially pneumonia, not suggested by signs and symptoms. Further, we sought to determine how often therapy was changed as a result of roentgenographic findings. Overall, 41 (22%) of 187 chest roentgenograms obtained during initial febrile episodes, recurrent fevers, or persistent fevers were abnormal. While most patients had signs and symptoms suggesting the presence of pulmonary disease, 17% had roentgenographic abnormalities detected in the absence of such findings. During initial febrile episodes, therapy was not changed in response to findings on the chest roentgenogram. However, during episodes of persistent or recurrent fever, findings on chest roentgenograms led to changes in therapy in eight (61%) of 13 episodes of which six (40%) resulted in clinical improvement. Chest roentgenograms were therefore found to be an important diagnostic tool in evaluating recurrent or persistent fever in the neutropenic patient but of little use during initial febrile episodes. 
4	Regression of intracardiac thrombus after embolic stroke. Using two-dimensional echocardiography, we studied the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombus regression accompanied by anticoagulant therapy in 82 consecutive patients with acute cardiogenic cerebral embolism. We noted intracardiac thrombus in 15 patients; nine of the 15 were started on anticoagulant therapy with warfarin potassium to maintain the prothrombin time between 2.5 and 3.5 (international normalized ratio). Serial two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained for these nine patients before and after anticoagulation, with the plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42, and D-dimer measured at the same time. In eight of the nine patients the intracardiac thrombi gradually decreased in size while the plasma level of fibrinopeptide A fell to within the normal range and the plasma levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 and D-dimer remained above the normal ranges. In the other patient the thrombus disappeared, with embolization to the right arm immediately after starting anticoagulant therapy. Mobile or small thrombi regressed earlier than nonmobile or large ones. We conclude that regression of intracardiac thrombi after anticoagulation may be based on the relative predominance of plasma fibrinolytic activity over anticoagulation-inhibited thrombin activity. 
5	Combined myocardial revascularization and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Myocardial infarction remains the leading cause of early and late deaths after abdominal aortic reconstruction in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our approach for the past 4 years has been combined myocardial revascularization with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in patients with good left ventricle performance. From July 1984 through June 1989, 128 patients underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Seventeen patients underwent combined abdominal aortic reconstruction with coronary artery bypass grafting. One patient died (5.9%). The remaining patients are all well at current follow-up. Our experience shows that patients with coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm may have both lesions safely repaired as a single operative procedure. 
5	Radiographic manifestations of congenital anomalies of the spine. Although the foregoing review of embryologic development and congenital anomalies of the spine in infants and children is necessarily brief, the most commonly encountered abnormalities have been reviewed, and when possible, an attempt has been made to cite the stage of embryologic development at which the various abnormalities originate. As noted, congenital abnormalities of the spine are relatively uncommon but may be of profound clinical significance. During the past decade, the most significant developments in the diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities have been ultrasonography, CT scanning, and MR imaging. In the neonate, the spinal cord and neural outflow can be evaluated by ultrasonography until the osseous elements begin to fuse. Thereafter, MR imaging is the procedure of choice because it permits evaluation of the spine and spinal cord in all planes of imaging and provides detailed evaluation of the effect of osseous abnormalities on neural structures. Finally, plain radiographs of the spine for evaluation of neonates who have any of a spectrum of sacral dimples are rarely helpful, and in the presence of significant cutaneous or subcutaneous abnormalities, ultrasonography is the preferred modality for evaluation. 
5	Comparative study of different techniques of intraocular gas tamponade in the treatment of retinal detachment due to macular hole. The injection of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or perfluoropropane (C3F8) was used as a method of internal tamponade in 43 eyes affected by retinal detachment due to macular hole. The technique of ocular hypotension prior to gas injection varied according to the characteristics of each case, using vitrectomy and SF6 30% in 8 cases (group 1), fluid-gas (SF6) exchange through the pars plana in 10 cases (group 2), paracentesis of the anterior chamber prior to injection of SF6 in 12 cases (group 3) and injection of C3F8 without drainage in 13 cases (group 4). Retinal reattachment was initially achieved in 87 (group 1), 83.3 (group 2), 100 (group 3) and 92.3% (group 4), but 4 recurrences yielded a 6-month follow-up cure of 75 (group 1), 75 (group 2), 91 (group 3) and 84% (group 4). Postoperative complications included proliferative vitreoretinopathy (7%), endophthalmitis (2.3%) and subretinal hemorrhage (2.3%). The use of intraocular gas tamponade appears to be a procedure with an acceptable complication rate in the treatment of retinal detachment due to macular hole. This study suggests the use of paracentesis and SF6 in phakic eyes, C3F8 in aphakic eyes and vitrectomy plus 30% SF6 in eyes with proliferative vitreoretinopathy or vitreoretinal traction adjacent to the macular hole. 
1	Flow cytometric analysis of the mechanism of methylmercury cytotoxicity. Flow cytometric analysis of murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) exposed in vitro to 2.5 to 7.5 mumol/l (micromolar) methylmercury (MeHg) reveals a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis (rate of passage through the S phase of the cell cycle), manifested as the accumulation of most of the cells in the S phase, and a modest accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cycle. Light microscopy reveals a progressive increase in chromosomal damage (condensation, pulverization). At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation. Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI). In addition, there is a dose-dependent increase in cellular refractive index (90 degrees light scatter), an apparent decrease in cell volume (axial light loss), and progressive resistance to detergent (NP-40)-mediated cytolysis. Resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis is indicative of fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, and so on) of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex. Our findings indicate that DNA synthesis is the primary target of MeHg cytotoxicity and that apparent targets and degree of cytotoxicity are a complex function of dose. 
1	Potential role of beta-carotene in prevention of oral cancer. Recent data suggests that retinoids and carotenoids may be effective in reversing a putative "field cancerization" defect in the epithelium at risk for oral cancer. Animal experiments have shown that these compounds can inhibit cancer formation. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of retinoids to reverse oral leukoplakia. However, toxicities associated with retinoids at the doses used in these studies limits their potential for chemoprevention. Because of its lack of toxicity, beta-carotene is a very attractive agent for chemoprevention. It suppresses micronuclei in exfoliated oral mucosal cells from subjects at risk for oral cancer and recently has been shown to be active in reversing leukoplakia. Another area under investigation is the possibility of preventing second primary tumors in patients cured of their initial cancer who have an increased risk of developing new cancers of the upper acrodigestive tract. 
4	Long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease. Personality hardiness, which has been conceptualized as a potential internal resource facilitating stress resistance, was examined in conjunction with Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and sociodemographic and medical variables to assess the independent differential correlations of these factors with long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease. One hundred twenty-eight patients completed the third generation Hardiness Scale, together with questionnaires measuring Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and psychosocial adjustment to illness. The results showed that personality hardiness was the most salient correlate of psychosocial adjustment. High hardiness scores were associated with good adjustment to the various life domains. Angina severity accounted for the variance in social domains, but not the psychologic distress domain. Type A behavior, both dimensions of perceived family dynamics, and the sociodemographic variables did not have a significant role in explaining the variance in psychosocial adjustment. We conclude that personality hardiness could serve as a valid indicator of long-term psychosocial adjustment in patients with coronary artery disease. 
5	The role of mucous glycoproteins in the rheologic properties of cystic fibrosis sputum. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by excessive amounts of thick and tenacious mucous secretions that obstruct organ ducts and passages. In the respiratory tract this is associated with chronic infection resulting in the hypersecretion of purulent sputum, which the patient finds difficult to clear. We have studied the rheologic properties of purulent sputum from six patients with CF and five patients with chronic bronchitis to assess whether CF is associated with increased sputum viscoelasticity. In addition, we have isolated the major rheologic determinants, mucous glycoproteins, from CF and chronic bronchitis sputa and, using a magnetic microrheometer, investigated the possibility that the altered properties of mucus in CF are associated with abnormalities in these glycoproteins. Creep compliance analysis indicated that the CF sputa possessed raised levels of both elasticity (p less than 0.01) and viscosity (p less than 0.01). These increases in both rheologic parameters were found to be associated with increases in the DNA content (p less than 0.01) and dry weight (p less than 0.05). Mucous glycoproteins were isolated from CF and chronic bronchitis sputum samples by gel filtration on Sepharose CL4B, followed by concentration to form 8% wt/wt gels. In the absence of other sputum components, no abnormality in the rheologic properties of CF mucin gels could be detected. However, when DNA was added, the CF gels responded with increases in both elasticity and viscosity of as much as 30% (p less than 0.05), an effect not observed in the chronic bronchitis gels. These results suggest that a subtle abnormality may exist in CF mucous glycoproteins and that this could have a role in the altered physical properties of mucous secretions in CF. 
1	Inflammatory breast cancer. Historically, the prognosis of inflammatory breast cancer has been poor. We conducted a retrospective review to evaluate the recent Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience, to evaluate the role of combination chemotherapy, and to compare the effect of surgery and radiation on local/regional failure. Fifty-six patients with local/regional inflammatory breast cancer diagnosed between 1975 and 1984 were identified. All were treated with combination chemotherapy. Overall 5-year survival was 45% with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 37%. Twenty-one patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Survival and disease-free survival rates were similar to those achieved in patients treated with mastectomy followed by chemotherapy. Residual cancer was found in all 21 patients treated with induction chemotherapy, with extensive disease present in 18, including six of seven complete responders. The local/regional failure rate was 34%. 
4	Doppler ultrasound of the deep leg veins. A revolution in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and monitoring of thrombolysis. The diagnosis of lower limb deep vein thrombosis can be made rapidly by compression ultrasound. This noninvasive test has almost completely replaced contrast phlebography in some major hospitals in North America. Compression ultrasound is well suited for making the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, measuring its extent, and monitoring the draining veins of the calf for evidence of spread of calf vein thrombosis. The nature of the deep vein thrombus, whether it is obstructing or nonobstructing, can be determined with the additional use of color Doppler mapping, a technique that displays flowing blood as a color overlay to the 2-dimensional real-time ultrasound image. Serial noninvasive determinations of the extent of thrombus in the lower-extremity deep veins is now possible with this combined sonographic imaging approach. Monitoring of possible changes in the extent of the thrombus burden can now be undertaken in patients enrolled in trials assessing the efficacy of different thrombolytic regimens. 
5	Giant breast hematoma requiring blood transfusion: an unusual complication after an echocardiographic study during thrombolytic therapy. We report on a patient in whom significant bleeding occurred during thrombolytic therapy. The bleeding occurred after an echocardiographic study, and it resulted in blood transfusion. 
5	Development of a traumatic intracranial hematoma after a "minor" head injury. We have analyzed features of patients who had what appeared initially to be a minor head injury but who developed an acute traumatic intracranial hematoma. Over a 10-year period, 183 patients who were able to open their eyes spontaneously, were oriented to person, place, and time, and who obeyed commands when they were first seen at a hospital subsequently underwent operation for an acute intracranial hematoma. The hematoma was extradural in 54% of these patients. A history of altered consciousness or symptoms of headache and vomiting were present in 61% of the patients; 33% had a focal neurological deficit, and 43% had either focal deficit or signs of a basal skull fracture. A skull fracture was shown radiologically in 60% of patients, including 52% of those not clinically suspected of having an intracranial lesion. Six months after injury, 77% of the patients had made a moderate or good recovery. The possibility that a patient who has recently sustained a head injury might develop an acute intracranial hematoma can never be completely discounted, even when there are no abnormal clinical signs, and a skull x-ray retains a useful place in the investigation of selected patients with a minor head injury. 
4	Free protein S deficiency in a family with venous thrombosis. Inherited deficiencies of protein S, an inhibitor of the coagulation system, are now recognized as occurring at least twice as frequently as antithrombin III deficiency in patients with venous thrombosis. Protein S is present in plasma in a complexed form, which is inactive, and in a free or functional form. Free protein S combines with activated protein C to inhibit factors V and VIII. This report describes the evaluation of a family with recurrent deep venous thrombosis and superficial thrombophlebitis. Levels of antithrombin III and protein C as well as plasminogen were normal. The levels of total protein S, which includes the value for the free and complexed forms of protein S, were also normal. However, the free protein S levels were greatly reduced in all symptomatic members who were studied. This report illustrates the importance of obtaining measurement of free protein S levels in patients who are suspected of having inherited venous thrombotic disorders. 
4	Hemodynamic determinants of vascular changes in hypertension and atherosclerosis. Several new concepts are reviewed concerning structural and functional changes in atherosclerotic and hypertensive blood vessels. First, in regard to modulation of vascular changes, atherosclerosis appears to progress more slowly during hypotension than during normotension. This finding may have implications for the optimal level of blood pressure. Second, structural "remodeling" of the vessel wall occurs in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Remodeling helps to preserve the arterial lumen despite intimal proliferation in atherosclerosis. In contrast, remodeling (which differs from vascular hypertrophy) reduces the vascular lumen in chronic hypertension. Third, functional changes impair active vasodilator responses in both atherosclerotic and hypertensive vessels, in part by endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we propose that leukocytes as well as platelets may be important cellular mediators of spasm in atherosclerotic arteries. 
1	Acute respiratory failure and pulmonary thrombosis in leukemic children. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) in an 11-year-old child with pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the beginning of induction therapy was observed, connected with a pulmonary thrombosis and not with an infective origin. A systematic search for this pathology identified six other children with the same pulmonary complication, five of whom where in the early phase of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and one in induction therapy for ALL in marrow relapse. At the beginning of the symptomatology, all children presented severe hypoxia and hypercapnia, with no or minimal chest radiograph abnormalities and no clear hemodynamic involvement. In all patients the arteriography and nuclear imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis. The causes of the thrombi could be connected with neoplastic emboli after cell lysis and/or with the vascular damage resulting from antiblastic therapy. Intravenous urokinase treatment and respiratory assistance had been successfully carried out in six of seven children. 
5	Desmopressin and antifibrinolytics. Desmopressin appears to be a safe and effective hemostatic agent for use during surgery in patients with mild to moderate hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Uremic patients also benefit from substitution of desmopressin for cryoprecipitate to control bleeding. The highly variable response to desmopressin by individual patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease dictates that each patient receive a trial administration prior to surgery; surgery should proceed only following verification of a therapeutically effective increase in Factor VIII and vWF after desmopressin. Use of desmopressin in patients with normal baseline hemostatic function is not clearly advantageous, although certain patient subgroups might benefit, and prospective studies have documented the drug's safety in these cases. Data are lacking to clarify a role for desmopressin during surgery in patients taking aspirin. Antifibrinolytic therapy appears to decrease bleeding without increased risk after cardiac surgery. In addition, specific use after urological surgery may be beneficial in the absence of upper urinary tract bleeding. In the last ten years, other applications for antifibrinolytic therapy have been found--both surgical (intracranial aneurysms, oral and lacrimal surgery) and nonsurgical (in cancer patients and for gastrointestinal bleeding). Although anecdotal reports have fueled fears of increased thrombosis with antifibrinolytics, controlled studies indicate no increased risk. 
5	Total knee arthroplasty in obese patients. We examined 182 patients (257 knees) who had had a total knee arthroplasty two to five six years earlier. The patients were grouped into five weight classes. Eighteen patients (twenty-seven knees) were considered moderately obese and twelve patients (twenty-seven knees), severely obese. The results in all but four knees were rated excellent or good. One patient needed a revision procedure for late infection, and the result was rated poor. Three results were rated fair. There was no discernible difference in the over-all scores among the five weight groups. However, 30 per cent of the knees of the moderately and severely obese patients had patellofemoral symptoms, whereas the incidence was 14 per cent in the other groups (p less than 0.03). No clear-cut association was found between obesity and either thrombophlebitis or complications related to the wound. 
2	Technical aspects of biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Radiologic imaging procedures play a major role in the evaluation of the potential patient for biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, both during the procedure and in follow-up evaluation. The treating physician must have a thorough knowledge of ultrasonography techniques. Lithotripsy requires continual monitoring and frequent reassessment to optimize targeting and fragmentation of the gallstones while maintaining patient comfort. 
5	New approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation. Infection occurring after solid organ transplantation continues to exert a considerable detrimental effect upon patient and allograft survival. While the search for better targeted immunosuppressive regimens continues, we must seek to improve our ability to both diagnose and treat those infections that do occur after transplantation. Viral infections in general, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in particular, represent an area in which substantial progress is being made. Improvement in diagnostic modalities has allowed more rapid and precise identification of CMV infection and disease, and the use of antiviral agents that possess activity against CMV has allowed both prophylaxis and treatment of this frequently life-threatening disease. The prophylactic use of presently available agents in combination and the development of less toxic, more potent anti-CMV agents should serve to further lessen the impact of CMV disease upon the field of solid organ transplantation. 
2	Vascular and microvascular changes--key factors in the development of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers in rats. The present study examined the time sequence and histologic and ultrastructural features of the formation and evolution of experimental, acetic acid-induced gastric ulcerations in rats. One hundred percent acetic acid was applied to the gastric serosa of 140 fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats through a polyethylene tube for 30 s. Gastric mucosal changes were evaluated at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, 1 and 3 h, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11 days after acetic acid application by visual inspection, by quantitative and qualitative light microscopy, and by transmission electron microscopy. Following exposure to acetic acid, the earliest morphologic changes occurred at 1 min and consisted of dilatation of large submucosal veins and arteries and mucosal collecting venules. Five to 15 minutes after injury, thrombi developed in submucosal veins and collecting venules, leading to microvascular stasis and mucosal necrosis. By 3 h, necrotic masses started to detach. By 24-48 h, necrotic changes penetrated the submucosa. By 72 h, most ulcers underwent transition into a "chronic" stage characterized histologically by the presence of granulation tissue at the bottom, and the appearance of a transitional healing zone at the margins. By 5 days, an increased amount of granulation tissue was observed and the gastric glands in transitional zones at the ulcer margin displayed cystic dilatation. Based on this study, we conclude that a key feature of acetic acid-induced ulcer formation is the early vascular and microvascular injury, which precedes glandular cell necrosis. 
3	Skin conductance and arousal in the newborn. We measured skin conductance continuously from the sole of a foot in babies of different conceptional ages before, during, and for 10 minutes after a 'heel prick' carried out for routine blood sampling. We studied 82 healthy babies whose gestational and postnatal ages ranged from 25-42 weeks, and 1-73 days. The median skin conductance level (preheel prick) in babies of 40-43 weeks' conceptional age was 0.6 microS (microsiemens) and differed significantly between awake babies (1.2 microS) and those who were asleep (0.5 microS). In contrast babies less than 40 weeks had a significantly lower median skin conductive level (0.3 microS) which was identical in awake and asleep babies. In response to the heel prick all babies became aroused and skin conductance rose sharply and immediately in 21 out of 22 (95%) babies 40-43 weeks' conceptional age, and in seven out of 23 (30%) babies 36-39 weeks. The median rise at one minute in babies of 40-43 weeks was significantly higher than those 36-39 weeks (2.7 microS compared with 0.5 microS). No babies less than 36 weeks had a change in their skin conductance after the heel prick. These results are consistent with the notion that 'emotional sweating' is a function of maturity and does not develop until 36 weeks' conceptional age. 
3	Expression of neural cell adhesion molecule in normal and neoplastic human neuroendocrine tissues. The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues. 
1	The long-term effects of radiation therapy on patients with ovarian dysgerminoma. A retrospective chart review and questionnaire study was undertaken to look at the long-term effects of radiation therapy in ovarian dysgerminoma patients. Forty-three patients and 55 controls responded to a questionnaire that detailed bowel, bladder, thyroid, menstrual, reproductive, sexual, and growth function. Statistically significant differences in the number of bowel movements were noticed when comparing patients with controls. The authors noticed no significant differences between cases and controls in bladder function. No thyroid disorders were attributable to mediastinal radiation therapy. Most patients with intact uteri bleed monthly on hormonal replacement. Three patients with a remaining ovary and uterus resumed menstrual function after substantial doses of abdominopelvic radiation therapy. No patients have conceived. The authors noticed a slight increase in dyspareunia in the treated group, but most patients were satisfied with their sexual function. One premenarchal patient exhibited a growth disorder. 
5	A rare case of renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. A report of successful surgical treatment in childhood. Renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection in an 8-year-old girl with aortic valvular stenosis is presented. A splenorenal arterial anastomosis without splenectomy was successfully performed. This procedure is considered best suited for children with thoracoabdominal aortic dissection as the autogenous graft is expected to grow and provide long-term patency. The spleen left in situ was expected to be advantageous, from the immunological aspect, at the time of open heart surgery for aortic valvular stenosis, which was anticipated in the near future in this child. 
5	Stroke recurrence within 2 years after ischemic infarction. We prospectively studied stroke recurrence in 1,273 patients with ischemic stroke who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank. Median follow-up was 13 months. The 2-year cumulative recurrence rate among these patients was 14.1%. Age, sex, race, history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or transient ischemic attacks, and stroke location were not associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence. Patients with an elevated blood pressure, an abnormal initial computed tomogram, or a history of diabetes mellitus were at a higher risk of stroke recurrence. In contrast, patients with an infarct of unknown cause were at a lower risk of stroke recurrence than patients with a defined stroke mechanism, such as lacune, embolism, or atherosclerosis. A multivariate model suggests that patients at the lowest risk for stroke recurrence have a low diastolic blood pressure, no history of stroke, no history of diabetes mellitus, and an infarct of unknown cause. 
1	Oncocytic glomus tumor of the trachea. An oncocytic variant of glomus tumor of the trachea occurred in a 47-year-old woman. She experienced intermittent cough and hemoptysis for about three years. Bronchoscopy and chest CT scan showed a small reddish polypoid tumor on the lower end of the trachea. Bronchoscopic biopsy was carefully done and was diagnosed as oncocytoma. A wedge resection of the tumor was done. Tumor cells were characterized by strongly eosinophilic granular cytoplasm on light microscopy and by numerous closely packed round or ovoid mitochondria with prominent tubular cristae on electron microscopy. They were arranged in a sheet around small vessels, as a result of which the biopsy diagnosis of oncocytoma was changed to oncocytic glomus tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an oncocytic glomus tumor arising from the trachea. 
5	Detection of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty: improved clinical decision making with use of a logistic model combining procedural and follow-up variables. A prospective study of 111 patients who underwent repeat coronary angiography and exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy 6 +/- 2 months after complete revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed to assess whether clinical, procedure-related and postangioplasty exercise variables yield independent information for the prediction of angiographic restenosis after angioplasty. Complete revascularization was defined as successful angioplasty of one or more vessels that resulted in no residual coronary lesion with greater than 50% diameter stenosis. Restenosis was defined as a residual stenosis at the time of repeat angiography of greater than 50% of luminal diameter. Restenosis occurred in 40% of the patients. The 111 patients were randomly subdivided into a learning group (n = 84) and a testing group (n = 27). A logistic discriminant analysis was performed in the learning group and the logistic model was used to estimate a logistic probability of restenosis. This probability of restenosis was validated in the testing group. In the learning group of 84 patients univariate analysis of 39 factors revealed 8 factors related to restenosis: recurrence of angina (p less than 0.0001), postangioplasty abnormal finding on exercise thallium-201 scintigram (p less than 0.0001), exercise thallium-201 scintigram score (p less than 0.0001), difference between exercise and rest ST segment depression (p less than 0.001), postangioplasty exercise ST segment depression (p less than 0.001), absolute postangioplasty stenosis diameter (p less than 0.003), postangioplasty exercise work load (p less than 0.03) and postangioplasty exercise heart rate (p less than 0.05). 
5	Idiopathic bilateral spontaneous hyphemas. Spontaneous hyphemas are rare and usually associated with iris microhemangiomas or other vascular anomalies of the iris. In addition, various systemic problems can result in spontaneous hyphema. This is a case report of a bilateral spontaneous hyphema (recurrent in one eye), in which no predisposing condition could be identified after exhaustive hematologic evaluation and iris fluorescein angiography. 
4	Change in sympathetic activity before, during, and after dialysis-induced hypotension. During the hemodialyses of eight patients with end-stage renal failure, who often had sudden-onset dialysis-induced hypotension, catecholamine (CA) levels were measured in the ultrafiltrate obtained by a mini-filter placed in series upstream of the dialyzer. The water evaporation rate from the skin (reflecting the perspiration rate) was also monitored. Results showed a temporary elevation in CA levels in the ultrafiltrate before hypotension occurred. This rise did not continue for long, returning to baseline when hypotension actually occurred. The temporary elevation may reflect transient compensation by the sympathetic nervous system for the decrease in vascular wall tension. It was also found that there was considerable water evaporation from the skin during hypotension. Because sweat gland activity is reflexively modulated by the baroreceptor, perspiration after a drop in blood pressure may reflect the normal diminiution in baroreceptor activity. 
1	Prognostic significance of serosal invasion in carcinoma of the stomach. Two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach invading the serosa were studied with regard to the relationship between the length of the serosal invasion (LSI) and prognosis, with a division made between expanding and infiltrative types of tumors. Among patients with expanding types of tumors, five year survival rates were 40 per cent in patients with LSI less than 4.0 centimeters, 33 per cent in patients with LSI 4.1 to 6.0 centimeters and 13.0 per cent in patients with LSI more than 6.0 centimeters. Among those patients with infiltrative types of tumors, those with less than 2.0 centimeters of LSI had a better prognosis (five year survival rate of 53 per cent), whereas those patients with a LSI more than 2.0 centimeters had a very poor prognosis (five year survival rate of less than 20 per cent) and the significant LSI on prognosis was found to be 2.0 centimeters. Involvement of the lymph node and metastasis to the liver were not affected by LSI, whereas the rates of peritoneal dissemination and direct invasion to neighboring organs increased with an increase in LSI. Knowledge of these factors facilitates the planning of postoperative treatment. 
1	Stomatococcus mucilaginosus catheter-related infection in an adolescent with osteosarcoma. Ours is apparently the first reported pediatric case of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus bacteremia. It is the second reported case of S mucilaginosus catheter-associated infection, but the first case successfully treated without removing the central venous catheter. This unusual organism should be added to the list of opportunistic pathogens that can be isolated from immunocompromised pediatric patients. 
3	Normalization of plasma arginine vasopressin concentrations when children with meningitis are given maintenance plus replacement fluid therapy We hypothesized that plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations in children with meningitis are appropriate for the children's degree of hypovolemia, even though the concentrations were higher than expected for the serum osmolality. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effect on plasma AVP concentrations of giving maintenance fluid requirements plus replacement of any deficit versus restricting fluids to two thirds of maintenance requirements for 24 hours. Plasma AVP concentrations and serum osmolality were measured before fluid therapy was begun and again after 24 hours. Nineteen children, 2 months to 17 years of age, were studied; 13 had bacterial meningitis (12 with Haemophilus influenzae type b). Ten children (seven with bacterial meningitis) received a mean of 1.42 times the calculated maintenance fluid requirements, and nine (six with bacterial meningitis) were restricted to a mean of 0.65 times maintenance. Children in the maintenance group also received significantly more sodium (mean = 6.3 mEq/kg/24 hr) than children in the fluid-restricted group (mean = 2.0 mEq/kg/24 hr). The two groups were comparable for plasma AVP concentration and serum osmolality before fluid therapy was begun. The plasma AVP concentration was significantly lower after 24 hours of maintenance plus replacement fluids than after fluid restriction (p = 0.005), and the change in AVP concentration correlated with the amount of sodium given (p less than 0.02). This study supports the hypothesis that serum AVP concentrations are elevated in patients with meningitis because of hypovolemia and become normal when sufficient sodium is given to facilitate reabsorption of water by the proximal tubule of the kidney. Patients with meningitis can be given maintenance plus replacement fluids but should be monitored for the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. 
1	Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management. 
2	Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: a cause of ascites and hepatomegaly after chemotherapy for leukemia. Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia. Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically, liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities. It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and/or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia. 
5	Hypoxia-induced in vivo sickling of transgenic mouse red cells. To develop an animal model for sickle cell anemia, we have created transgenic mice that express a severe naturally occurring human sickling hemoglobin, Hb S Antilles. Due to its low solubility and oxygen affinity, Hb S Antilles has a greater propensity to cause red cell sickling than Hb S. To make transgenic animals that express a high level of Hb S Antilles, the erythroid-specific DNAse I hypersensitive site II from the human beta-globin cluster was linked independently to the human alpha 2-globin gene and to the beta S Antilles gene. Embryos were injected with both constructs simultaneously and seven transgenic mice were obtained, three of which contained both the human alpha and the human beta S Antilles transgene. After crossing the human transgenes into the mouse beta-thalassemic background a transgenic mouse line was derived in which approximately half the beta-globin chains in the murine red cells were human beta S Antilles. Deoxygenation of the transgenic red cells in vitro resulted in extensive sickling. An increase of in vivo sickling was achieved by placing these transgenic mice in a low oxygen environment. This murine model for red cell sickling should help to advance our understanding of sickle cell disease and may provide a model to test therapeutic interventions. 
5	Clinical prediction rule for pulmonary infiltrates OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a clinical rule for predicting pneumonic infiltrates in adult patients with acute respiratory illness. DESIGN: Prevalence studies in three settings. SETTING: Emergency departments of the University of Illinois Hospital at Chicago, the University of Nebraska Medical Center at Omaha, and the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond. PATIENTS: Symptoms, signs, comorbidity data, and chest roentgenogram results were recorded for 1134 patients from Illinois (the derivation set), 150 patients from Nebraska, and 152 patients from Virginia (the validation sets). All patients presented to the emergency department and had a chest roentgenogram to evaluate fever or respiratory complaints. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within the training set, temperature greater than 37.8 degrees C, pulse greater than 100 beats/min, rales, decreased breath sounds, and the absence of asthma were identified as significant predictors of radiographically proved pneumonia in a stepwise logistic regression model (P = 0.001). The logistic rule discriminated patients with and without pneumonia in the training set with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.82. In the validation sets, the rule discriminated pneumonia and nonpneumonia with ROC areas of 0.82 and 0.76 after adjusting for differences in disease prevalence (P greater than 0.2 compared with the training set). The predicted probability of having pneumonia for patients with different clinical findings corresponded closely with the incidence of pneumonia among patients with such findings in the three settings. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults presenting with acute respiratory illness, a prediction rule based on clinical findings accurately discriminated patients with and without radiographic pneumonia, and was used in two other samples of patients without significant decrement in discriminatory ability. This rule can be used by physicians to develop more effective strategies for detecting pneumonia and for helping to determine the need for radiologic study among patients with acute respiratory disease. 
1	Bile acids and the increased risk of colorectal tumours after truncal vagotomy. An association between colorectal cancer and previous peptic ulcer surgery is reported. In a prospective screening study, 100 asymptomatic patients (80 men and 20 women) who had undergone truncal vagotomy at least 10 years previously were investigated by barium enema, colonoscopy and gallbladder ultrasonography. Control data were obtained from forensic autopsy subjects. The incidence of neoplasms greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in the vagotomized group was 14 per cent (11 adenomas, 3 carcinomas) and 3 per cent in controls (P = 0.01). Duodenal bile obtained at endoscopy from 21 vagotomized patients with normal gallbladders and from 21 control patients undergoing endoscopy was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean percentage of cholic (CA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), deoxycholic (DCA) and lithocholic (LCA) acids in the bile of vagotomized patients was 32.3, 45.6, 20.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively compared with 45.3, 36.2, 17.9 and 0.7 per cent respectively in controls. The increased proportions of CDCA and LCA and decreased proportions of CA in the duodenal bile of vagotomized patients were significant (P less than 0.001; P = 0.02; P = 0.007). Abnormalities in bile acid metabolism may help to explain the increased risk of colorectal neoplasia 10 years after truncal vagotomy. 
5	Macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria preceding renal IgA deposition in patients with IgA nephropathy. Although the clinical onset of IgA nephropathy is frequently impossible to define, macroscopic hematuria apparently heralds the onset of the disease in some patients. We describe the clinical course and renal histologic findings of four adults with IgA nephropathy who were diagnosed by the characteristic immunohistologic features in a second renal biopsy specimen. IgA was not detected in the initial renal biopsy specimens obtained 9 months to 4 years earlier. The first renal biopsy had been performed to evaluate macroscopic hematuria (recurrent in three patients), accompanied by pathologic proteinuria in two patients. Our observations suggest that the pathognomonic immunohistologic findings of IgA nephropathy may follow the clinical onset and raise questions about the presumed pathogenetic role of IgA in the early stages of this disease. 
5	Skin blisters as a manifestation of oxazepam toxicity. A 75 year-old comatous patient was admitted after ingestion of 200 mg oxazepam. Skin blisters, attributed to oxazepam toxicity, appeared on the left forearm the following day and regressed spontaneously nine days later. 
4	Loss of endothelium-dependent relaxant activity in the pulmonary circulation of rats exposed to chronic hypoxia. To determine whether exposure to chronic hypoxia and subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension induces alterations of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat pulmonary vascular bed, we studied isolated lung preparations from rats exposed to either room air (controls) or hypoxia (H) during 1 wk (1W-H), 3 wk (3W-H), or 3W-H followed by 48 h recovery to room air (3WH + R). In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is associated with a loss of EDRF activity in pulmonary vessels, with a rapid recovery on return to a normoxic environment. 
2	Effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. To determine the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, we undertook a retrospective review of 31 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated at Children's National Medical Center. Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a "poor prognosis." All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO. The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively. Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged. Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO. Our review demonstrates that ECMO improved survival significantly in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who had a "poor prognosis" by the criteria of Bohn et al. We recommend consideration of ECMO for all infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia for whom maximal medical therapy has failed. 
4	Clinical nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: insight into metabolism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can nondestructively evaluate changes in metabolites with different disease states, as well as with therapeutic interventions. Animal studies have provided the basis for understanding changes in high-energy phosphates with myocardial ischemia. Studies of graded ischemia due to partial coronary stenosis have shown the sensitivity of the ratio of phosphocreatinine to inorganic phosphate to small reductions in myocardial blood flow and its relation to myocardial function. The application of NMR spectroscopy to humans requires precise localization techniques to avoid acquiring contaminating information from structures around the heart, such as the chest wall and diaphragm. With these localization techniques, metabolic evidence of ischemia has been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction and patients with known coronary disease, although the sensitivity of this technique for the diagnosis of inducible ischemia is unknown. At rest, patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies often have an elevated phosphodiester resonance, possibly signifying abnormal breakdown of membrane phospholipids. Increasing oxygen demand in these patients does not usually alter high-energy phosphates, suggesting that oxidative energy metabolism is preserved under these conditions. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to increase understanding of metabolic changes in a variety of pathologic conditions. 
3	Rat soleus muscle ultrastructure after hindlimb suspension. The aim of the present investigation was to determine, by quantitative electron microscopy, the effects of a 5-wk tail-suspension period on rat soleus muscle ultrastructure. A marked decline (-60%) in muscle mass occurred. The mean fiber cross-sectional area decreased to a greater extent (-75%) than the capillary-to-fiber ratio (-37%), leading to a higher capillary density (+148%) after hypokinesia. The total mitochondrial volume density remained unchanged, whereas the volume density of myofibrils was slightly but significantly reduced (-6%). A shift from subsarcolemmal to interfibrillar mitochondria occurred. Interfibrillar mitochondrial volume density was highest near the fiber border and decreased toward the fiber center. An increase in volume density of satellite cells suggested muscle regenerative events. Soleus atrophy with tail suspension greatly decreases the muscular volume but leaves the ultrastructural composition of muscle fibers relatively unaffected. 
2	Does somatostatin analogue prevent experimental acute pancreatitis? Because somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic secretion, we hypothesized that pretreatment with somatostatin analogue octreotide (SMS 201-995) might prevent cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis. We studied 18 rats prepared with jugular vein catheters. The following agents were administered intravenously to groups of four rats for 6 hours: 1 mL/h (control) crystalloid solution; 1-microgram/kg bolus then 1 microgram/kg per hour of octreotide; and 5 micrograms/kg per hour of cerulein; also, in a fourth group of six rats, octreotide and cerulein were administered simultaneously. At the end of experiments, blood was drawn for plasma amylase determinations; rats were killed and pancreata were examined. Supramaximal cerulein administration to conscious rats induced hyperamylasemia and edematous pancreatitis, confirming previous observations; in both groups of rats receiving cerulein, there was prominent interstitial edema, acinar vacuolization, and mild-to-moderate acute inflammation. While octreotide pretreatment of rats with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was associated with a lesser increase of wet pancreas weight and plasma amylase concentration, there was little overall benefit of octreotide pretreatment in this form of experimental acute pancreatitis. 
2	High grade dysplasia of the gastric mucosa: a marker for gastric carcinoma. The natural history of gastric epithelial dysplasia and its relation to gastric cancer are ill defined. A consecutive series of 40 patients with an initial diagnosis of gastric epithelial dysplasia based on examination of endoscopic biopsies has been reviewed to determine the clinical outcome and to evaluate a two tier histological grading system as a predictor of the risk of cancer. On review, only 20 of the 40 patients were considered to have true dysplasia: seven patients had low grade dysplasia and 13 had high grade dysplasia. Of the 13 patients with high grade dysplasia, 11 (85%) were found to have gastric cancer within 15 months. Of the 10 patients with high grade dysplasia who underwent gastrectomy, six were found to have early gastric cancer, three had cancer invading into the muscularis propria, and none had lymph node metastases. High grade dysplasia is thus a marker of gastric cancer. Moreover, the cancers associated with high grade dysplasia are usually pathologically favourable and curable. The finding, by an experienced pathologist, of high grade dysplasia in two separate sets of endoscopic biopsies is therefore an indication for radical surgical treatment, provided that the patient's age and general condition permit such an approach. 
1	Patency rate of implantable devices during long-term intraarterial chemotherapy. Intraarterial implantable drug delivery systems have been considered as an alternative method for treating patients with unresectable liver malignancies. However, catheter problems with external implanted devices have resulted in limited application of chemotherapy. The introduction of subcutaneous devices offers an opportunity for long-term locoregional chemotherapy. Twelve external intraarterial catheters were implanted into 12 patients and 52 subcutaneously placed devices into 51 patients, all with various hepatic malignancies. Retrospective analyses comparing those two intraarterial systems were conducted taking into account the function and complication rate (hepatic artery thrombosis, infection, leaking, hemorrhage, and dislocation). The follow-up time for the external system was two to eight months (median five weeks), the thrombosis rate 33.3%, and the infection rate 25%. One instance of severe bleeding from the hepatic artery occurred during chemotherapy. One catheter dislocated. For the subcutaneously implanted intraarterial devices the follow-up time was five to forty-one months (median sixteen months), the thrombotic complication rate 17.3%, and the infection rate 7.6% (all patients with simultaneous bowel surgery). Catheter dislocation one year later required reimplantation; in 1 patient therapy had to be discontinued because of a catheter leak. The overall function rate was 71.3% with a median follow-up time of eight months. Anticoagulation therapy for subcutaneously implanted devices starting from the beginning of intraarterial chemotherapy is recommended to achieve long-term patency. No implantation should be preformed simultaneously with bowel surgery. The subcutaneously placed intraarterial devices had a higher function rate and were available for a longer period as compared with external implanted catheters. 
1	Widespread inflammatory response to osteoblastoma: the flare phenomenon. A case of vertebral osteoblastoma caused a diffuse, reactive inflammatory infiltrate in two vertebrae, adjacent ribs, and the paraspinous soft tissues. The authors call this the flare phenomenon. On magnetic resonance images the diffuse inflammatory response caused a misleading appearance that simulated a malignant process (lymphoma or Ewing sarcoma). A computed tomographic myelogram was diagnostic. 
5	A clinical trial of allopurinol (Zyloric) for myocardial protection. This study explored myocardial protective effects of allopurinol at various doses. Ninety patients undergoing coronary artery bypass or repair or replacement of cardiac valves were divided into three groups of 30 patients each in accordance with the amount of allopurinol administered to patients in each group. Patients in group I received no allopurinol, those in group II received low-dose allopurinol (total dose 1200 mg), and those in group III received high-dose allopurinol (total dose 2400 mg). Aspartate aminotransferase, cardiac isoenzyme of creatine kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase levels were measured up to 5 days after operation. Concentrations of allopurinol and oxypurinol were also measured before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at the start and at the end of aortic crossclamping. Postoperative aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase 1 plus lactate dehydrogenase 2 levels in group III were significantly lower than those in groups I and II. Aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase 1 plus lactate dehydrogenase 2 levels in group II were lower than those in group I, without statistically significant differences. Plasma oxypurinol concentrations were significantly higher in group III than in group II. It was concluded that allopurinol had resultant high myocardial protective effects in dose-related fashion, but its effect might be attributed to oxypurinol levels formed by its degradation. 
4	Role of alcohol in recurrences of atrial fibrillation in persons less than 65 years of age. The role of alcohol in recurrences of atrial fibrillation (AF) was assessed in a consecutive series of 98 patients (75 men) aged less than 65 years. In addition to etiologic assessment using clinical and laboratory methods and echocardiography, the patients' drinking habits were evaluated by recording the amount of alcohol used during the week preceding AF, by responses to the CAGE (Cut, Annoying, Guilt, Eye; see below) questionnaire (a screening test for alcohol abuse) and by selected laboratory tests. Two groups of control subjects were studied: 98 sex- and age-matched patients admitted to the emergency ward for acute illnesses, and 50 subjects selected randomly from the local out-of-hospital population. The mean alcohol consumption among men during the study week was 186 g (median 45 g; range 0 to 2,100 g) among patients, whereas among male hospital and population control subjects it was 86 g (30 g; 0 to 1,050 g) and 94 g (35 g; 0 to 630 g), respectively. When the weekly alcohol consumption was analyzed in 3 categories (0; 1 to 210 g; greater than 210 g), there was a significant difference between AF cases and hospital control patients (p = 0.03), but not between AF cases and population control subjects. Multivariate analysis of data of AF cases and population control subjects showed that alcohol intake and a positive response to 1 or more of the CAGE questions were independently related to AF in men. Other independent risk factors were the presence of heart disease, low serum potassium and lack of sleep or experience of excess psychologic stress, or both. 
4	Left ventricular asynchrony in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Left ventricular regional wall motion was evaluated in 11 patients with pulmonary hypertension and 18 control subjects. All 11 patients had secondary pulmonary hypertension and less than 20% measured diameter stenosis in any vessel. This study utilizes a video-intensity-based frame-by-frame computerized technique. All pulmonary hypertensive patients showed early diastolic asynchrony in the anterior or apical regions that lasted 100-200 ms. The size of the abnormal area varied from 2 to 20% of the ventricular silhouette. Four patients also showed systolic abnormalities. No abnormalities were detected in the control group. The cause of the asynchrony detected in pulmonary hypertension is probably due to interventricular interaction caused by pressure gradients across the septum. 
4	Surgical repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defect. Thirty-one patients underwent repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) from 1980 to 1989. All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV, and 15 of them were in cardiogenic shock when operated on. Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients before surgery: nine had one-vessel, 11 had two-vessel, and 11 had three-vessel disease. The VSD was anterior in 15 patients and posterior in 16. The operative technique evolved over the years from a fairly extensive infarctectomy and reconstruction of the septum and right and left ventricular walls with a double Dacron patch, to minimal or no infarctectomy and closure of the VSD by excluding the infarcted muscle from the left ventricular cavity. This is accomplished by suturing a single patch of bovine pericardium to healthy endocardium surrounding the infarcted muscle. The right ventricle is left intact. Overall mortality was 10%, with three operative deaths. All deaths occurred in patients in cardiogenic shock who had three-vessel coronary artery disease. Thus, the mortality for patients in shock was 20%, and the mortality for patients with three-vessel disease was 27%. The operative mortality for patients with posterior VSD was twice as high as in patients with anterior VSD. However, univariate analysis of various clinical, hemodynamic, and operative variables indicated that only three-vessel disease was predictive of operative mortality. Because the number of patients was small and the overall operative mortality relatively low, the results of this analysis may not be valid. 
2	Mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation produce persistent gastric ulcers in the rabbit. Evaluation of antiulcer drug binding to experimental ulcer sites. A method producing persistent gastric ulcers in the rhesus monkey by combined mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation was modified and evaluated in the rabbit. gamma-Irradiation (800-1000 cGy) immediately after removal of 2-mm-diameter sections of antral mucosa resulted in ulcer craters 5-7 days later. Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment. 
1	Classification of endometrial cells on cervical cytology. One hundred eighty-eight women who had endometrial cells on cervical cytologic specimens during the secretory phase or in the postmenopausal period were studied retrospectively. Each had undergone hysterectomy or endometrial biopsy within 12 months of the original smear. The endometrial cells were classified as typical, atypical, or suspicious for carcinoma. Among premenopausal subjects, three of 57 with typical cells had endometrial hyperplasia, one of two with atypical cells had endometrial polyps, and both with cells suspicious for carcinoma had endometrial carcinoma. In the postmenopausal group, ten (13.5%) of 74 with typical endometrial cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma, and five (22.7%) of 22 with atypical cells and 24 77.4%) of 31 patients with suspicious cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma. The present findings and a review of the pertinent literature demonstrate that the classification system used is helpful in predicting the risk for endometrial disease in patients with endometrial cells seen on cervical cytologic smears during the secretory phase or in the postmenopausal period. 
3	Kenneth McKenzie, Harvey Cushing, and the early neurosurgical treatment of spasmodic torticollis. In 1923, Dr. Kenneth McKenzie trained at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital under Dr. Harvey Cushing. At that time, a patient with spasmodic torticollis came to Cushing and was treated with an innovative operation for this disorder with good results. This case sparked an interest in Dr. McKenzie, who published the case 1 year later. In reviewing the surgical histories from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, we have found the original records of this well-documented case. The record includes postoperative drawings of the intraoperative field by Dr. Cushing, a sketch by Dr. McKenzie illustrating the postoperative sensory examination, and pre- and postoperative photographs of the patient. 
4	Thrombectomy for late graft limb occlusion: our experience in 182 consecutive cases. Late occlusion of an aortofemoral bypass graft is usually caused by fibrointimal hyperplasia or progressive atherosclerosis. Several surgical approaches have been advocated in order to minimize the operative risk, to correct the impaired inflow and to provide a satisfactory outflow. In the last 16 years, in the Institute of Vascular Surgery and Angiology of the University of Milan, we have operated upon 182 consecutive thrombosed grafts. Inflow was restored by performing a graft limb thrombectomy using a Fogarty balloon catheter and simultaneously employing an endarterectomy ring stripper to dislodge tenaciously adherent fibrinous material and thrombotic plug. As the superficial femoral artery was generally occluded, usually a good outflow was achieved by profundaplasty in 101 cases (55.5%) or direct bypass (interposition graft), to a more distal segment of the profunda femoris artery in 55 cases (30.2%). Concomitant popliteal or tibial revascularization was done in the remaining 26 cases (14.3%) when pre-operative or intra-operative findings suggested an inadequate collateral network through the profunda femoris artery. Early re-occlusion, which occurred in 14 cases (7.6%), generally due to insufficient outflow, was corrected by additional intervention in 7 cases (3.8%), while 7 legs were amputated for extensive atherosclerotic disease. Six patients died giving a mortality rate of 3.3%. This low rate in a high risk population is probably related to our policy of operating under loco-regional anaesthesia. Long term results, with a patency rate of 62.0% at 3 years and 60.2% at 5 years (life table method), prove that this operation is a durable procedure for correction of graft limb thrombosis. 
1	Long-term survival patients with acute and severe renal failure due to multiple myeloma. We selected 37 cases, followed-up for more than 36 months or until death, from a series of 45 patients affected by acute renal failure due to multiple myeloma in order to identify the parameters that could allow the outcome to be predicted. The patients were allocated to group 1, consisting of 27 patients who died within one year and to group 2, consisting of 10 patients who survived for more than 36 months. Renal failure was severe enough to require dialysis in 28 patients, 16 of whom were oliguric. Renal biopsy was performed in 23 cases, whereas light chain isoelectric point and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were evaluated in each patient. All the patients underwent chemotherapy, which was associated with plasma exchange in 16 patients. Statistical analysis of the potential prognostic factors in the 2 groups showed that the incidence of hypercalcemia, infection, irreversible renal failure and severe tubulo-interstitial damage was significantly higher in group 1. Sex, tumor load, severity of renal failure and light chain isoelectric point had no prognostic significance. Finally, the number of patients treated by plasma exchange was significantly higher in group 2. Our results underline the prognostic role of both hypercalcemia and infection and justify aggressive treatment consisting of chemotherapy, plasma exchange and dialysis, even in cases of severe renal failure and high tumor load. 
1	The impact of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on cancer screening: perspective from the National Cancer Institute. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evaluated the medical literature, utilizing strict criteria to judge the merits of experimental trials designed to show benefit in screening for cancer. For individuals at normal risk, the task force was not able to make recommendations for or against screening for colorectal, prostate, skin, oral, or testicular cancers. Only one physical-examination cancer-screening procedure has ever been tested in a randomized trial. During the past 27 years, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has funded six randomized screening trials. Thus far, only one has shown a decrease in mortality. Recognizing the limitations of such trials, the NCI published "Working Guidelines for Early Cancer Detection." Designed for the practicing physician, these guidelines were based upon the best available evidence and on the judgment of representatives of medical professional organizations. 
4	Computed tomography for evaluation of puerperal infections. Pelvic computed tomography was used to evaluate 74 women with persistent puerperal infection. There was at least one abnormal roentgenographic finding in 57, and these are correlated with clinical and surgical findings. In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography. In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography. Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence. We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings. 
2	Dysphagia in patients with the post-polio syndrome BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Dysphagia may develop in some patients many years after an attack of acute paralytic poliomyelitis. To identify clinical or subclinical signs of oropharyngeal dysfunction, we examined 32 patients (mean age, 48.9 years) with the post-polio syndrome (defined by new weakness in the limbs). Of the 32 patients, 14 had symptoms of new swallowing difficulties, and 18 were asymptomatic in this respect; 12 had a history of bulbar involvement during acute poliomyelitis. Swallowing function was assessed objectively by ultrasonography, videofluoroscopy, and an oral motor index score for 10 components of oral function. RESULTS. All but 1 of the 32 patients, regardless of whether they had new symptoms or previous bulbar involvement, had some abnormality on detailed testing of oropharyngeal function; only 2 patients had any signs of aspiration. The mean oral motor index score (a quantitative measure of oral sensorimotor function) in the patients was higher than that in age-matched normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Videofluoroscopy showed abnormalities of varying severity, including unilateral bolus transport through the pharynx, pooling in the valleculae or pyriform sinuses, delayed pharyngeal constriction, and impaired tongue movements. On ultrasonography, the mean (+/- SD) duration of wet swallows was significantly longer in the symptomatic patients than in the asymptomatic patients (2.67 +/- 0.70 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.42 seconds). The four patients who were reexamined two years later had objective signs of worsening oropharyngeal function and corresponding new symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with the post-polio syndrome, the bulbar muscles often have clinical or subclinical signs of dysfunction. These abnormalities suggest that in bulbar neurons there is a slowly progressive deterioration similar to that in the muscles of the limbs. 
5	Nursing home patients transferred by ambulance to a VA emergency department. Nursing home residents are frequently transferred to hospital emergency departments. Delayed transfer may lead to poor outcomes. However, inappropriate transfer of the frail elderly may cause social and financial problems. We prospectively evaluated 221 consecutive ambulance transfers from community nursing homes to a VA emergency department. The objectives of the study were to describe the process and outcomes of transferred patients and to determine if alternative interventions were feasible. The results indicate that the problems of nearly half the study group could have been treated at the nursing home by a visiting physician with minimal medical equipment. Those admitted to the hospital (52%) were seriously ill, had prolonged lengths of stay (23.6 days), and had a high mortality rate (11%). Complex issues of physician reimbursement, proprietary nursing home budgeting, and day-to-day expediency appear to be involved in decisions to transport patients by ambulance to VA emergency departments. 
3	Genetic mapping of "Lubag" (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism) in a Filipino kindred to the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. "Lubag" is an X-linked disorder causing dystonia and parkinsonism that has only been described in families from the Philippines, principally from the island of Panay. We have established linkage between the disease phenotype "lubag" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism. 
1	Early carcinoma of the gallbladder: macroscopic features and US findings. To facilitate early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, a comparative study of macroscopic forms and ultrasonographic (US) features of stage I (TNM staging system) gallbladder cancer was carried out retrospectively in 71 cases of such carcinomas that were resected surgically. Macroscopic forms of the lesions were classified into four types: pedunculated (eight cases), sessile (15 cases), superficial raised (25 cases), and flat (23 cases). Among 71 cases, only 20 were diagnosed preoperatively by means of US. US patterns of the lesions were also classified into four types: fungating mass, lumen filling, smooth raised, and thickening of mucosa. US features corresponded well to the macroscopic forms. No flat lesion was identified preoperatively. For early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, it seemed essential to pay careful attention to mild mucosal change, as more than 50% of early cancers did not show apparently protruding lesions. 
5	Renal transplant pyelocaliectasis: role of duplex Doppler US in evaluation. To distinguish the obstructed from the nonobstructed dilated collecting system of transplanted kidneys without interventional diagnostic measures, the authors prospectively evaluated duplex Doppler analysis (determination of resistive index [RI]) in 35 renal transplant patients with pyelocaliectasis. Proof of the presence or absence of obstruction was obtained at interventional procedures in 18 patients and at clinical follow-up in 17. Thirteen kidneys were obstructed (mean RI, .81 +/- .06), while 22 had nonobstructive dilatation (mean RI, .66 +/- .07). The RI difference was statistically significant (P less than or equal to .01). Of 21 kidneys with a normal RI, only two had obstruction. In both of these, the obstruction was associated with a significant peritransplant collection of fluid due to a ureteral leak. In the seven obstructed transplanted kidneys with follow-up, the mean RI was .82 +/- .06 before nephrostomy and .67 +/- .05 after nephrostomy. Obstruction was a common cause of an elevated RI (greater than or equal to .75). Other causes of transplant dysfunction can be associated with an elevated RI and nonobstructed dilatation. More important, a normal RI should strongly argue against obstruction unless a ureteral leak is also present. 
4	Popliteal artery occlusion caused by cystic adventitial disease: successful treatment by urokinase followed by nonresectional cystotomy. Preoperative diagnosis of an occluded popliteal artery caused by cystic adventitial disease allowed use of urokinase to successfully dissolve secondary thrombosis. Subsequent non-resectional adventitial cystotomy and evacuation of cyst contents allowed lasting restoration of a patent arterial lumen and return of normal distal pulses. This nongrafting technique may serve as a model for future patients with occluded arteries caused by this condition. 
4	Thromboxane synthetase inhibition decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation following hindlimb ischemia. Ischemia of the lower extremity has been shown to cause pulmonary leukostasis and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Thromboxane (TX) has been implicated as a mediator in this process. The effect of OKY-046, a TX synthetase inhibitor, on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) production of superoxide anion (O2-) as determined by ferricytochrome reduction was examined. Fourteen dogs were subjected to 6 hours of bilateral gracilis muscle ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. O2- production from resting PMNs and PMNs stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ, 0.1 mg/ml) was measured prior to ischemia or drug treatment (baseline), and following reperfusion in both treated (n = 7) and control groups (n = 7). Serum TX levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. Following reperfusion, TX levels in the treated group were decreased as compared with the control group (18 +/- 2 pg/ml vs. 72 +/- 26 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). Superoxide production by both resting and stimulated PMNs was also decreased in the treated group; from 0.98 +/- 0.16 nmol to 0.43 +/- 0.12 nmol O2- in the resting state (P less than 0.05) and from 13.3 +/- 1.5 nmol to 9.0 +/- 1.1 nmol O2- after stimulation (P less than 0.005). O2- production was increased in the control group following reperfusion as compared with baseline samples, and this increase was attenuated by treatment with OKY-046. TX synthetase inhibition decreases activation of PMNs following hindlimb ischemia. 
4	Intravascular ultrasound imaging of an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm: a case report. A case of acute dissecting aortic aneurysm is described in which intravascular ultrasonography was used at the time of aortography to produce real-time, 360 degree cross-sectional images of the aorta. The transmural vessel morphology visualized by this new catheter-based technology allowed confirmation of the diagnosis and identification of distal extension to the aortic bifurcation. The case demonstrates the unique potential of this modality in diagnosis and possible therapy in vascular diseases. 
4	Interruption of critical aortoiliac collateral circulation during nonvascular operations: a cause of acute limb-threatening ischemia. In patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease interruption of critical collaterals during another nonvascular or cardiac operation may threaten limb viability. This occurred in four patients whose limb-threatening ischemia was precipitated by radical cystectomy with bilateral hypogastric artery ligation, left colon resection, or coronary artery revascularizations by means of the internal mammary artery. Important collateral pathways, the interruption of which may account for this phenomenon, are detailed, and approaches are outlined for prevention and management of acute ischemia in this setting. 
4	The epidemiologic necropsy for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The epidemiologic necropsy measures the occurrence of unsuspected disease through the examination of necropsy records. The estimates of unsuspected disease should approximate what occurs in the living population. The necropsy records of the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City) from 1950 to 1984 were examined for the occurrence rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Each adult patient was categorized as (1) without abdominal aortic aneurysm, (2) abdominal aortic aneurysm discovered as a necropsy surprise, or (3) abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed or suspected during life. Necropsy detection rates of unsuspected abdominal aortic aneurysms were compared with those found in five published screening surveys. The necropsy detection rate in men was 81 (0.019) of 4155 and was 28 (0.009) of 3142 in women, a difference that was statistically significant. When the necropsy series was adjusted to reflect the same demographic composition as the screening surveys, the results from necropsy and screening were statistically similar. In particular, two surveys from the United Kingdom showed screening detection rates among white men of 0.072 compared with a necropsy detection rate of 0.058. These results further support the use of the epidemiologic necropsy as a research tool for estimating the reservoir of disease in the population. 
2	Why does somatostatin cause gallstones? Long-term administration of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, is complicated by gallstone formation. Somatostatin is known to inhibit hepatic bile secretion and gallbladder emptying. However, the effect of octreotide on gallbladder bile composition remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that octretide would alter hepatic bile composition and cause gallbladder stasis, thereby increasing gallbladder bile solute concentrations. Fourteen control prairie dogs received daily saline injections, whereas 10 animals received 1 micrograms of octreotide subcutaneously three times per day for 5 days. Cholecystectomy and common bile duct cannulation were then performed. Octreotide increased hepatic bile concentrations of bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.05), and total protein (p less than 0.01). Rsa, an index of gallbladder stasis, was decreased (p less than 0.01) in the octreotide group. Gallbladder bile total calcium (p less than 0.05), bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.01), total protein (p less than 0.05), and total lipids (p less than 0.05) were increased in the octreotide group. Animals receiving octreotide also had decreased hepatic (p less than 0.05) and gallbladder (p less than 0.001) bile pH. No differences in cholesterol saturation index were observed. These data suggest that in the prairie dog, octreotide (1) alters hepatic bile composition, (2) causes gallbladder stasis, and (3) increases gallbladder bile calcium, bilirubin, protein, lipid, and hydrogen ion concentrations. We conclude that octreotide causes alterations in gallbladder bile composition that increase the likelihood of cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate precipitation. 
4	Normal and diffusely abnormal myocardium in humans: functional and metabolic characterization with P-31 MR spectroscopy and cine MR imaging. The current study tested the concept that cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy might be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the functional and metabolic status of the myocardium in humans. Thirteen patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and eight healthy volunteers were imaged at 1.5 T with the one-dimensional chemical shift imaging technique for localization of P-31 MR spectroscopy and an electrocardiographically referenced gradient refocused sequence for imaging of the heart. Prominent peaks in the PDE and PME regions were observed in cardiomyopathic patients, but only the former peak was measured. The PCr/beta-ATP peak ratio was not significantly lower in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy subjects (1.51 +/- 0.08 vs 1.54 +/- 0.04). The ratios of PDE/PCr (0.80 +/- 0.07 vs 0.54 +/- 0.10) (P less than or equal to .01) and PDE/beta-ATP (1.19 +/- 0.10 vs 0.84 +/- 0.08) (P less than or equal to .05) were significantly higher in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared with healthy volunteers. Left ventricular systolic wall thickening was significantly lower and left ventricular peak and end-systolic wall stress and mass were significantly higher in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy volunteers. Thus, localized, gated P-31 MR spectroscopy combined with cine MR imaging allowed identification of both abnormal myocardial phosphate metabolism and abnormal ventricular function. While this study suggests that increased myocardial PDEs may be a marker for abnormal myocardium, the sensitivity and specificity of this marker need to be further evaluated. 
1	Predictive value of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium as a clinical marker for familial adenomatous polyposis. One hundred forty-eight members of 53 kindreds with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were examined for congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) and extracolonic manifestations (ECM) to assess the value of CHRPE as a predictive marker for FAP. Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups. In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes. By contrast, in a second group of 18 families, all 32 polyposis patients and all 18 members at risk had less than 4 lesions. Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group. Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately. The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families. When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance. 
3	Visually evoked potentials and electroretinography in neurologic evaluation. Electrophysiologic testing of the visual system requires primarily the ERG and the VEP. The flash electroretinogram provides information about the outer retina only. The pattern electroretinogram is derived from both the outer retina and the innermost retinal layers including the ganglion cell layer. The VEP is based on electrical information recorded from the visual cortex in response to stimulation of the retina. Thus, the integrity of the entire visual pathway can be tested. Localizing ability of the VEP is limited. Since the visual cortex is heavily weighted by representation of the central retina, peripheral lesions, including those producing peripheral visual field abnormalities that do not impinge upon central fixation, may produce relatively little disturbance of the VEP. As with most tests, electrophysiologic studies of the visual system must be placed in context of the entire examination, including the patient's history and neurologic and especially neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Electrophysiologic testing has three main uses in neurology. Pattern-reversal VEPs may be useful in detecting hidden visual loss in multiple sclerosis; VEPs and ERGs can distinguish function from organic visual loss; and VEPs and ERGs can be useful in the diagnosis of visual loss in nonverbal patients, especially in children. 
3	Involvement of the central nervous system in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: a clinical, electrophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging study. In a consecutive series of 30 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) minor clinical evidence of CNS involvement was found in five. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 28 and revealed abnormalities consistent with demyelination in nine patients aged less than 50 years and abnormalities in five aged 50 years or over. Measurements of central motor conduction time (CMCT) were obtained in 18 and showed unilateral or bilateral abnormalities in six. It is concluded that subclinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common, at least in patients with CIDP in the United Kingdom, but that clinically evident signs of CNS disease are infrequent. The association of a multiple sclerosis-like syndrome with CIDP is rare. 
1	Continuing care for cancer pain relief with oral morphine solution. One-year experience in a regional cancer center. This report is a prospective study of 223 patients with intractable cancer pain who were offered continuing care during the year 1988 at the Pain Relief Unit, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India, with a minimum follow-up of 4 months and a maximum follow-up of 16 months. A high percentage of pain relief was attained within a mean duration of 4 days, which on follow-up was maintained at a steady level in most patients (91.1%). Oral morphine could not be continued in three patients because of vomiting. The main side effects noticed were nausea and vomiting, itching, and constipation. At any time during the first 140 days, only 30% of patients had side effects and appropriate medication successfully managed these side effects. During the rest of the study period, the side effects were minimal. Oral morphine used with proper adjuncts offers the best pain palliation in most patients, with minimal side effects. 
1	Relationship of uptake of technetium-99m(Sn)-N-pyridoxyl-5-methyltryptophan by hepatocellular carcinoma to prognosis The relationship of technetium-99m(Sn)-N-pyridoxyl-5-methyltryptophan (99mTc-PMT) uptake by hepatic tumors to survival was studied in 162 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The median survival of 82 patients in whom hepatic tumors showed increased uptake in delayed 99mTc-PMT imaging was 1013 days, which was significantly longer than the survival time of 398.5 days of 80 patients in whom hepatic tumors did not show increased uptake of radioactivity (p less than 0.002). The relationship between the ability of hepatic tumors to take up 99mTc-PMT and survival was also analyzed in patients with HCC showing filling defects in 99mTc-colloid liver images and, in relation to the therapy, serum values of bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein. Results indicated that the degree of 99mTc-PMT uptake by hepatic tumors is closely correlated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. 
4	Natural history and cardiac manifestations of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Forty-nine patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (diagnosed on the basis of family history, xanthomatosis, total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein receptor status) were studied over a period of 13 years, and underwent cardiovascular assessment. Eleven died, nine of myocardial infarction. Seven underwent coronary artery bypass, and another five had surgery to relieve supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis. A distinctive pattern of disease was noted. Coronary ostial stenosis (four patients) and aortic root stenosis (six patients), both consequences of aortic root cholesterol deposition, were the typical manifestations of heart disease in childhood and adolescence. Adults developed severe coronary artery disease with a high incidence of main stem lesions (four of five patients). Surgery provided effective treatment for coronary artery disease and aortic outflow tract stenosis. Overall survival appeared to be better than reported in other studies which may reflect the 'receptor-defective' status of this group of patients. 
5	Endoscopic control of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It has been estimated that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding occurs in more than 100,000 patients with peptic ulcer disease each year. In 75-80% of the cases, bleeding will be self-limited. A major predictor of persistent or recurrent bleeding is the magnitude of blood loss before the initial evaluation. Endoscopy has an important role in the evaluation of the patient with suspected or presumed upper GI bleeding. Active bleeding at the time of the endoscopy correlates with the more likely probability of persistent bleeding, which carries a higher morbidity and mortality. In addition, there has been continued interest in the finding of a visible vessel. Although there is some controversy as to what a visible vessel actually is and how closely observations will agree about its recognition, there is general agreement that it is an important endoscopic finding and that it carries a high likelihood of rebleeding. In addition to the finding of a visible vessel, many endoscopists feel that ulcers found in the posterior-inferior wall of the duodenal bulb and high on the lesser curve of the stomach should be considered in a separate category. Owing to their proximity to large vessels, some feel that endoscopic management carries a greater risk because of the possibility of inducing bleeding. A wide variety of endoscopic approaches are available for the therapy of upper GI bleeding. It is convenient to divide these therapies into four categories: (a) topical, (b) injection, (c) mechanical, and (d) thermal. Endoscopic therapy for bleeding ulcers has generally been performed with a high degree of safety. 
5	Ondansetron compared with high-dose metoclopramide in prophylaxis of acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron with those of high-dose metoclopramide in treating acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. SETTING: Conducted at two university hospitals, a cancer institute, and six community hospitals. PATIENTS: Of 125 patients, 95 were evaluable for the acute phase and 79 for the delayed phase. Major reasons for not being evaluable were no second course (14 patients), protocol violation (5 patients), and change in cisplatin dose (3 patients) for the acute phase, and rescue medication on day 1 (7 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), and inadequate data (4 patients) for the delayed phase. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received cisplatin, 50 to 100 mg/m2 body surface area (median, 75 mg/m2); none had previously received chemotherapy. Thirty minutes before the cisplatin administration, ondansetron was given intravenously over 15 minutes, at a loading dose of 8 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Metoclopramide was given at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, followed by a continuous infusion for 8 hours (4 mg/kg). For the delayed phase (days 2 through 6), the first oral dose was given as soon as the infusion was completed; the oral dose consisted of either metoclopramide, 20 mg three times daily, or ondansetron, 8 mg three times daily for another 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the acute phase, a major or complete response was seen in 72% of the ondansetron-treated and 41% of the metoclopramide-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Nausea was significantly better controlled among the ondansetron-treated patients (P = 0.04). In the delayed phase, no statistically significant difference was seen between ondansetron- and metoclopramide-treated patients. Nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is significantly more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute nausea and vomiting. In the delayed phase, the results of both drugs were disappointing, although metoclopramide's effect on delayed nausea was superior. Patients preferred ondansetron. 
4	Vitamin E in gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. To clarify the relationship among vitamin E, oxygen radicals, and lipid peroxidation in ischemia-reperfusion, we produced an experimental model of gastric mucosal injury in rats by ischemia-reperfusion with clamping of the celiac artery and measurements of the area of gastric erosion, thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances, and alpha-tocopherol in serum and gastric mucosa during ischemia-reperfusion. The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage. 
5	Flecked retina associated with ring 17 chromosome. We report the case of a mentally retarded male with a ring 17 chromosome who had subretinal drusen-like deposits in each eye. This is the second report of flecked retina in a patient with ring 17 chromosome, suggesting that there may be a causal relationship between abnormalities of chromosome 17 and retinal pigment epithelial or photoreceptor dysfunction. 
2	Normalization of ventilation/perfusion relationships after liver transplantation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: evidence for a hepatopulmonary syndrome. To examine the effect of liver transplantation on the respiratory and cardiovascular functions, ventilation/perfusion relationships were determined by multiple inert gas elimination technique in six patients with end-stage liver disease 1 to 19 mo before and 2 to 6 mo after liver transplantation. Cardiac output and pulmonary vascular pressures were measured after catheterization of the pulmonary artery. All patients had normal spirometry and chest x-ray films before transplantation. PaO2 before transplantation was 78.8 +/- 7.4 mm Hg (range = 51.8 to 102.8 mm Hg). All patients had perfusion of poorly ventilated lung regions (low ventilation/perfusion relationships) varying from 3% to 19% of cardiac output (mean = 8.5% +/- 2.4% of cardiac output) and two patients had intrapulmonary shunting (3% and 20% of cardiac output). Measured and calculated PaO2 agreed closely, indicating absence of pulmonary diffusion abnormality, as well as of extrapulmonary shunting. After transplantation, PaO2 normalized in all patients, and both shunting and low ventilation/perfusion relationships disappeared. Cardiac output decreased from 9.1 +/- 1.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.05), and the pulmonary vascular resistance increased from 0.69 +/- 0.14 to 1.64 +/- 0.43 mm Hg/L/min (p less than 0.05). The systemic vascular resistance also increased (before = 8.7 +/- 1.0; after = 15.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg/L/min; p less than 0.001). Normalization of respiratory and cardiovascular alterations, after liver transplantation, in patients with end-stage liver disease indicates that these changes have a direct functional relationship to the diseased liver. It is hypothesized that this is part of a "hepatopulmonary syndrome,' which in similarity to the hepatorenal syndrome disappears with improved liver function. 
5	Increased sensitivity to endotoxemia by tissue necrosis. In this study the interaction of endotoxemia and ischemic organ injury was investigated in a rat model. Animals received lipopolysaccharide to induce endotoxemia and were simultaneously subjected to renal ischemia. If only renal ischemia was induced, moderate azotemia occurred and all animals survived. Lipopolysaccharide treatment caused neither renal failure nor death. However, rats with both endotoxemia and renal ischemia showed severe azotemia, and 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. The observed mortality rate is unlikely related to renal failure since animals subjected to bilateral nephrectomy did not die within 48 hours after treatment with lipopolysaccharide. To further exclude the role of renal failure in the enhanced effect of endotoxemia, experiments were performed in which ischemic kidneys were excised from littermates and were placed in the abdomens of lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. A similar effect was observed: 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. Azotemia did not occur. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine involved in endotoxemia-induced morbidity and death, we studied the role of TNF in our model. Plasma levels of TNF were increased during endotoxemia. Concomitant renal ischemic injury did not influence the concentration of TNF. When animals were treated with recombinant TNF and were subsequently subjected to renal ischemic injury, again a 50% mortality was observed, a rate similar to that in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. We conclude that the sensitivity to endotoxemia is enhanced by tissue necrosis and may lead to death in the experimental model used in this study. 
4	Arterial mechanical properties in dilated cardiomyopathy. Aging and the response to nitroprusside. The effects of aging on arterial mechanical properties and the response to nitroprusside were examined in 25 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. High-fidelity pressures were recorded with a multisensor catheter. Pulse wave velocity was determined between two sensors in the thoracic aorta. Arterial compliance was determined by an analysis of the diastolic waveform and cardiac output. At baseline, despite a similar systemic vascular resistance, the pulsatile load (e.g., arterial compliance) and wave transmission characteristics (e.g., pulse wave velocity) were altered with aging. Arterial compliance was reduced in older (greater than 50 yr, n = 8) versus younger (less than 35 yr, n = 8) patients (0.51 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.33 +/- 0.63 ml/mmHg, P less than 0.01) and intermediate in those 35-50 yr of age (n = 9, 0.72 +/- 0.40 ml/mmHg). There was a positive correlation between age and pulse wave velocity (r = +0.90). Nitroprusside infusion decreased resistance, increased arterial compliance, and lowered pulse wave velocity in all groups. Yet, advancing age was associated with a greater fall in wave velocity for a given fall in aortic pressure. The slope (K) of the relation between pulse wave velocity and aortic diastolic pressure progressively increased with age (0.01 +/- 0.03, 0.06 +/- 0.02, and 0.09 +/- 0.03 m/s-mmHg). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant relation between K and age. These data demonstrate that in older patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the left ventricle is coupled to an arterial circulation that has a greater pulsatile load, despite a similar steady load. Furthermore, these age-related changes in the arterial system affect the hemodynamic response to pharmacologically-induced vasodilatation. 
3	The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. Part III. A retrospective study. A retrospective study of 31 patients who had diagnosed velopharyngeal incompetence and were surgically managed with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap was completed. The following were analyzed: age at time of operation, gender, physical status, diagnostic protocol, length of operation (length of total surgery) and length of superior based pharyngeal flap, length of postoperative hospital stay, length of total hospital stay, length of follow-up, speech results, complications, patient care, and medication. The result showed that the optimal timing for correction of velopharyngeal incompetence was between 3 and 6 years of age. The mean length of total hospital stay was 2.7 days, postoperative complications were minimal, and speech results were generally good. 
5	Pheochromocytoma and acute myocardial infarction. When a pheochromocytoma is manifested as an acute myocardial illness, diagnosis may be difficult to make. If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case). The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop. The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event. 
5	Driving and epilepsy. A review and reappraisal Driving and epilepsy is a problem that involves physicians as both care providers to patients and consultants to regulatory authorities. Driving restrictions for people with seizure disorders are intended to ensure the public's safety, but such restrictions may unduly harm the welfare of many people with seizures. In the United States, all states now permit some people with epilepsy to drive. In general, only people whose seizures are adequately controlled are licensed to drive. Adequate control has been judged principally by the seizure-free interval, but individual state standards widely vary. There is a trend toward greater liberalization of driving standards for people with seizure disorders, but the appropriateness and application of these standards continue to raise questions, as does the role physicians should have in the licensing process. Our responsibilities to persons with disabilities and advances in our understanding of seizures and the nature of driving risks warrant a reappraisal of the current medical, legal, and social implications of driving and epilepsy. 
2	Helicobacter pylori and gastric carcinoma. Serum antibody prevalence in populations with contrasting cancer risks. This investigation examined the correlation between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, as reflected in immunoglobulin G serum antibodies, and the risk of gastric cancer. Serum samples were obtained from populations with contrasting gastric cancer risks. The highest prevalence of HP infection, 93%, was observed in the adult population at highest gastric cancer risk, the residents of Pasto, Colombia. In the lower risk Colombian city of Cali, a 63% overall prevalence rate was found. Both children and adults were sampled in New Orleans, Louisiana, where gastric cancer rates are high for blacks but not for whites. The prevalence of HP infection was significantly higher in black than in white adults, 70% versus 43%, P = 0.0001. A higher prevalence was also detected in black compared with white children, 49% versus 32%, P = 0.01; however, an even greater disparity was noted when comparing children from two hospitals, regardless of race, which serve different socioeconomic groups. A prevalence rate of 54% was found at Charity Hospital compared with 24% (P = 0.0001) at Children's Hospital. Our findings indicate that socioeconomic conditions, known to influence gastric cancer risk, are also important determinants of HP infection. 
4	Direct visualization of ruptured chordae tendineae by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. To determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae, 28 patients who had surgical therapy for pure mitral regurgitation were evaluated prospectively by conventional transthoracic and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. Seventeen patients (Group I) had ruptured chordae tendineae and 11 (Group II) had intact chordae tendineae. Transthoracic echocardiography detected ruptured chordae tendineae in 6 patients from Group I (sensitivity 35%) and flail leaflets in 11 patients from Group I (sensitivity 65%). Transesophageal echocardiography disclosed ruptured chordae tendineae in all 17 Group I patients (sensitivity 100%); the sensitivity was significantly higher than that of transthoracic echocardiography. No abnormal chordal echoes were visualized in any patient from Group II by either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (specificity 100%). Transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detecting ruptured chordae tendineae and is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in establishing its diagnosis. 
1	The significance of moderate and severe inflammation on class I Papanicolaou smear The significance of a cytologic diagnosis of moderate and severe inflammation with a normal (class I) Papanicolaou smear has not been addressed. A retrospective review of 596 consecutive cervical smears performed over 13 months revealed 85 women who had a class I cytologic smear with moderate to severe inflammation. Seventy-eight patients had colposcopic examinations and were considered for this study. Fifty-nine (75.6%) had cervical punch biopsies and/or endocervical biopsies. Of the 78, 19 (24.4%) had cervical condylomata and nine (11.5%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. We conclude that class I cytologic smears with moderate to severe inflammation may be associated with findings of condylomata and cervical dysplasia. 
4	Fibrous skeleton and ventricular outflow tracts in double-outlet right ventricle. Twenty-four hearts in which both great arteries arose from the right ventricle were studied to establish variations present within the fibrous skeleton and infundibular morphologies. Variations were also noted in the location of the ventricular septal defect and measurements were obtained of the outlet septum and the circumferences of the arterial valves. Completely muscular subarterial infundibulums were present in only 9 (37.5%) of the hearts, with varying degrees of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial and atrioventricular valves in the remainder. The aorta was rightward and posterior in 12 (50%) of the hearts, and subaortic and subpulmonary ventricular septal defects were present in equal numbers in this group. No subaortic defects were present when the aorta was side-by-side and right-sided. No subpulmonary defects were present in hearts with a posterior aorta. The mean ratio of 0.91 +/- 0.36 for the subpulmonary to subaortic length of the outlet septum was significantly less than the value of 1.54 +/- 0.41 noted previously in hearts with tetralogy of Fallot (p less than 0.001). 
2	Treatment of pruritus of primary biliary cirrhosis with rifampin. Pruritus can be a debilitating symptom in patients with chronic cholestasis. Based on previous reports of its efficacy, we evaluated the impact of rifampin on the pruritus associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. Fourteen patients were included in a randomized, crossover study. After a 15-day washout period, subjects were followed for three weeks. During the first and third week, patients received 600 mg of rifampin or placebo; no treatment was administered during the second week. Pruritus was subjectively scored on a scale from 0 to 100. With rifampin, pruritus disappeared in 11 patients and partially improved in three; with placebo, only two had a partial response (P less than 0.001). Six patients with a prior poor or no response to cholestyramine improved with rifampin. No changes in biochemical tests or side effects were observed during this period. We conclude that short-term administration of rifampin relieves pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis. When administered over a period of eight months in an open study, the relief of pruritus was maintained, while one individual developed an allergic reaction. Rifampin appears to be a safe drug in the management of the pruritus of primary biliary cirrhosis. 
5	Augmentation mammaplasty by means of the transrectus route. A new operative technique has been developed for augmentation mammaplasty. Through an inframammary incision, the anterior rectus sheath is entered, and the pocket is dissected in an entirely submuscular plane. We have performed this procedure in 112 patients to date. Complications have been few. The capsular contracture rate in 90 patients followed for greater than 1 year is 7 percent. The inframammary crease can be lowered using this technique, making mastopexy unnecessary in most patients with moderate ptosis. 
5	Recombinant Epstein-Barr virus with small RNA (EBER) genes deleted transforms lymphocytes and replicates in vitro. Strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with deletions of the small RNA (EBER) genes were made by homologous recombination using the EBV P3HR-1 strain, which has undergone deletion of the essential transforming gene that encodes the EBV nuclear antigen, EBNA-2, and a DNA fragment that was wild type at the EBNA-2 locus but from which the EBER genes had been deleted. Even though the EBER and EBNA-2 genes are separated by 40 kilobases, selection for transforming P3HR-1 recombinants that required a restored EBNA-2 gene resulted in 20% cotransfer of the EBER deletion. EBER-deleted recombinants transformed primary B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which were indistinguishable form LCLs transformed by wild-type EBV in their proliferation, in latency-associated EBV gene expression, and in their permissiveness for EBV replication cycle gene expression. EBER-deleted virus from infected LCL clones could infect and growth-transform primary B lymphocytes. These procedures should be applicable to the construction of other EBV recombinants within 40 kilobases of the EBNA-2 gene. The EBER-deleted EBV recombinants should be useful in further evaluating the role of EBERs in EBV infection. 
5	Acquired retinal arteriovenous communications in occlusive disease of the carotid artery. Retinal arteriovenous communications proximal to extensive areas of complete vascular closure developed in three patients with occlusive disease of the carotid arteries. In one case, the authors document the development of the arteriovenous communications through successive enlargement of small retinal vessels after progressive signs of retinal ischemia in the form of narrowed retinal arteries, venous dilation and beading, microaneurysms, retinal dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and capillary nonperfusion. The development of arteriovenous communications in carotid occlusive disease has not been described previously. 
5	Cerebrospinal norepinephrine concentrations and the duration of epidural analgesia This study was performed to determine whether the addition of norepinephrine to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia in man. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured. In the first part of the study, epidural catheters were inserted in 14 patients before herniotomy. Mepivacaine, 1.5 per cent (0.35 ml.kg-1), was administered and norepinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) was added in seven patients. The duration of anaesthesia was prolonged from 54 +/- 11 min to 83 +/- 12 min (P less than 0.05) and CSF NE concentrations increased from 68 +/- 12 pg.ml-1 to 336 +/- 85 pg.ml-1 in the NE group (P less than 0.01). In the second part, eight patients with herpetic neuralgia received epidural analgesia at the fourth to eighth thoracic interspace, using bupivacaine 0.25 per cent, with and without NE. The CSF NE concentrations in this group were greater than in the surgical patients before operation and increased from 254 +/- 58 to 406 +/- 58 pg.ml-1 30 min after administration of bupivacaine with NE. The duration of pain relief was prolonged with NE. These results suggest that adding NE to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia. Moreover, NE concentrations in surgical patients increased to levels similar to those found in patients suffering from herpetic analgesia. This suggests that the increase of CSF NE in chronic pain states has an antinociceptive effect. 
5	A controlled trial of early adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia remains a common cause of serious morbidity and mortality in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The extensive lung injury that accompanies pneumocystis-associated respiratory failure and the reports of clinical benefit from the use of adjunctive corticosteroids provided the rationale for this prospective multicenter trial. METHODS. A total of 333 patients with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia received standard treatment and were randomly assigned to receive either corticosteroids (beginning with the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone twice daily) or no additional therapy. The primary end points in this unblinded trial were the occurrence of respiratory failure (hypoxemia ratio [partial pressure of arterial oxygen divided by fraction of inspired oxygen] less than 75, intubation, or death), death, and dose-limiting toxicity of the initial standard therapy. RESULTS. Of the patients with confirmed or presumed pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 225 and n = 26, respectively), those assigned to treatment with corticosteroids had a lower cumulative risk at 31 days of respiratory failure (0.14 vs. 0.30, P = 0.004) and of death (0.11 vs. 0.23, P = 0.009), as well as a lower risk of death within 84 days (0.16 vs. 0.26, P = 0.026). The frequency of dose-limiting toxicity of the standard therapy was similar in the two treatment groups. Intention-to-treat analyses of the entire cohort confirmed these findings. Clinical benefit could not be demonstrated, however, for patients with mild disease (hypoxemia ratio, greater than 350), equivalent to a partial pressure of oxygen greater than 75 torr on room air. The patients assigned to corticosteroid treatment had an excess of localized herpetic lesions (26 percent vs. 15 percent, P = 0.04) but not of other infections or of neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS. Early adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids reduces the risks of respiratory failure and death in patients with AIDS and moderate-to-severe pneumocystis pneumonia. Because the adverse effects are few, corticosteroids should be included as part of the initial treatment for persons with AIDS who have moderate-to-severe pneumocystis pneumonia. 
5	Point mutation, allelic loss and increased methylation of c-Ha-ras gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Somatic alterations of the c-Ha-ras gene were examined in 21 Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Restriction endonuclease analysis by double digestion with MspI and HpaII revealed that DNAs from two of 21 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were affected by nucleotide substitution at the twelfth amino acid coding sequence of the c-Ha-ras gene. DNAs from cirrhotic noncancerous liver tissue, but not leukocytes, of one of these patients possessed the mutation, whereas DNAs from noncirrhotic liver tissue and leukocytes of the other patient did not. In one of the nine patients harboring heterozygosity for c-Ha-ras-related BamHI-fragments, the loss of one allele was demonstrated as a somatic change not only in DNA from the tumor tissue but also in DNA from the cirrhotic nontumorous tissue. In two of the 19 patients comparatively examined for digestion patterns of c-Ha-ras locus with HpaII and MspI, extensive methylation was observed as a somatic modification in both DNAs from the tumor and the cirrhotic nontumorous tissues. These results thus indicate that the genetic lesions affecting the c-Ha-ras gene do occur in human hepatocellular carcinoma and probably serve as one of the multiple steps in the process of hepatic carcinogenesis. 
5	Assay of serum cardiac myosin heavy chain fragments in patients with acute myocardial infarction: determination of infarct size and long-term follow-up. To evaluate the correlation between myosin heavy chain release and the necrosis mass, serum levels of myosin heavy chain fragments were determined serially in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Eight of these patients were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents: the others were not treated. The same myosin titration was applied to the sera of 25 dogs with an experimental myocardial infarction. Six of the dogs were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents. The time courses of the myosin concentrations are typical and monophasic for all patients with a noncomplex myocardial infarction. The values for the kinetic parameters of myosin release are comparable to those previously reported. We have now determined that cumulative myosin release significantly correlates with cumulative creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase release, as well as with thallium-201 distribution, as determined for different patient groups. Thrombolytic treatment does not seem to qualitatively upset myosin kinetics. The results obtained in dogs with or without thrombolysis conclusively indicate that myosin release is a quantitative index of the necrosis mass. From a practical point of view, a few serial determinations of serum levels of myosin heavy chains are enough to estimate the necrosed mass in patients with acute myocardial infarction. More generally, serum myosin titration could be useful in detecting any cardiac disturbance involving myocardial injury resulting in membrane leakage of cardiac cells. 
2	Endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding varices in children. Thirty-three children with esophageal varices due to portal hypertension underwent injection sclerotherapy over a period of 6 yr. Thirty-one completed the sclerotherapy course, and the varices were eradicated in all. In nine, the procedure was performed as an emergency because of continued bleeding and, in each case, a gastric fundal varix was the source of the blood loss. Sclerotherapy successfully controlled the bleeding in four of these, whereas five required surgical underrunning of the fundal varix. After surgery, these five continued sclerotherapy until the esophageal varices were eradicated. Complications included transient pyrexia (39%), retrosternal discomfort (30%), esophageal ulceration (18%), and esophageal stricture (12%). Rebleeding before initial eradication of the varices occurred in 12 patients but, thereafter, was very uncommon and always small in amount. Esophageal varices recurred after initial eradication in 33% of cases but were easily sclerosed with further injections. This study demonstrates that sclerotherapy is effective in reducing bleeding frequency in children with portal hypertension, but emphasizes the need for regular follow-up endoscopy after initial eradication of esophageal varices. 
4	Hemodynamic status in critically ill patients with and without acute heart disease. Physicians have been urged to reduce the use of the pulmonary artery catheter. However, there are no guidelines to help the clinician make the decision to use or withhold invasive monitoring in the individual patient. This study was designed to examine the accuracy of physician estimates of cardiac function in a spectrum of patients with hemodynamic instability to determine whether differences in accuracy among subgroups would suggest subgroups of patients who could be managed without invasive measurements. Physician estimates of cardiac index were found to be sufficiently accurate in patients without acute heart disease that initial management without invasive monitoring may be appropriate in selected cases. However, due to the general inaccuracy of physician estimates, efforts to improve the accuracy of clinical judgments of cardiac function and hemodynamic status should be pursued with vigor in patients both with and without acute cardiac dysfunction. 
3	Atherosclerotic carotid disease and the eye. The evaluation and management of retinal ischemia from atherosclerotic carotid disease is in a state of flux reflected by the change from emphasizing surgical management in the '70s toward skepticism about the benefit of surgery in the '80s. In addition, reliable noninvasive diagnostic testing of the carotid artery has reduced the risk. The decision to consider surgical versus medical management must be made on an individual basis based on the patient's health, age, and the risk of angiography and surgery at each institution. In children and young adults, amaurosis fugax is a benign condition. In the older population amaurosis fugax is often the sentinel event of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and possible early death from myocardial infarction. A team including the neurologist, internist, ophthalmologist, and surgeon optimizes care of the whole disease and not just the symptom. It is hoped that information in the next decade will supply additional guidance in the care of this multifaceted malady. 
2	Trolox protects rat hepatocytes against oxyradical damage and the ischemic rat liver from reperfusion injury. Trolox, a hydrophilic analog of vitamin E, was reported to scavenge peroxyl radicals from artificial systems better than its parent compound. Here we examined the possible cytoprotective effect of Trolox in cultured hepatocytes and in the rat liver. In cultured rat hepatocytes, 0.5 to 16 mmol/L Trolox (with optimum between 1 to 2 mmol/L) was observed to prolong the survival of cells exposed to oxyradicals generated with xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine. The protection by 1 mmol/L Trolox surpassed that provided by either ascorbate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase and/or catalase--each at a level giving its maximal protection in the same system. In both a global and partial model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats, infusion of Trolox (7.5 to 10 mumol/kg body weight) just before reflow reduced by greater than 80% the liver necrosis sustained in untreated (no Trolox) control rats. Such organ salvage was apparently accompanied by approximately 50% reduction in the amount of hepatic conjugated dienes, which were quantified by a highly specific radiochemical assay. Since conjugated dienes are presumed to be good "markers" of oxyradical damage, our data may have provided a semiquantitative link between free radical-induced necrosis and its chemical imprint in vivo. The data also indicated a relatively rapid and potent antioxidant-like action by Trolox on rat hepatocytes and on the postischemic reperfused rat liver. 
3	Therapy of diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with nimodipine. We investigated the therapeutic effect of nimodipine or parathyroidectomy in old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by observing 98 male 1-year-old rats over 5 months. After stroke had occurred, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) parathyroidectomy, 2) nimodipine, and 3) controls. In the nimodipine group, the rats survived longer than those in the other groups. Blood pressure of the controls did not differ from the nimodipine-treated and parathyroidectomy animals. The increase in calcium content of brain and kidney tissues and of plasma renin activity, urea, and creatinine was attenuated by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy. The histology of the kidneys revealed widespread fibrinoid necrosis of arteries in all rats. In the nimodipine-treated or parathyroidectomy groups, healing of the lesions was detectable. Cerebral lesions were mainly characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. Nimodipine-treated as well as parathyroidectomied animals showed significantly fewer hypertensive cerebral lesions. In old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, therapy with nimodipine or parathyroidectomy increased their survival rate. The cerebrovascular and renovascular lesions of treated animals were attenuated, and morphologic signs of healing were observed. Reduction of calcium overload by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy, even in an advanced stage of disease, had a therapeutic effect. 
5	Family recovery after vascular surgery. Twenty-one families were observed in a 3-month study to assess family coping with major vascular surgery and recovery. Analysis of family measures data (the Family APGAR, the Family Inventory of Resource for Management, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales) was combined with grounded theory method to assess family responses over time and recovery outcomes. Containment emerged as the major conceptual category of the grounded theory. Containment refers to a constellation of constructed meanings for events and behavioral responses used by families to regulate the impact of the surgical crisis and reduce family disruption. This "contained" coping pattern was manifested in families' avoidant behaviors and narrow definitions of the problem: that is, they defined their situation in terms of the surgical repair as cure rather than palliative intervention for a chronic, progressive disease. Situational factors such as the insidious development of the illness and the primary focus of care providers in the hospital on surgical care (allowing families' narrow definitions of their situation to remain unchallenged) also contributed to containment. Containment resulted in poor risk factor management as a major recovery outcome. Isolation and family conflict were evident throughout the recovery period. Concerns generated by continued evidence of morbidity during recovery contributed to a developing awareness of underlying disease, and diminishing containment when this growing awareness was openly shared within the family. Significant findings of the family measures analysis were compared with the grounded theory of the qualitative data. Each corroborated the other in key dimensions. 
1	Esophageal malignancies: is preoperative radiotherapy the way to go? During the period 1969 to 1988, 68 patients with esophageal malignancy were subjected to preoperative radiotherapy consisting of 30 Gy over 3 weeks followed by esophagectomy after a wait of 2 weeks. Sixty-two of 68 patients (91%) were followed up retrospectively (5-year survival rate, 17.2%; 10-year survival rate, 4.8%). Radiosensitivity of the tumor was graded by a radiation effect scoring method devised by us, and this was found to correlate with long-term prognosis (p = 0.05). Radiotherapy "sterilized" malignant involvement of adventitia and draining lymph nodes in 8 patients and thereby converted "palliative" into potentially "curative" resections with a mean survival of 57.2 months in this group of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to increase the survival, decrease the incidence of residual tumor at the resected stump, reduce the incidence of local recurrence, and increase the resectability rate. 
3	Localization of technetium-99m-glucarate in zones of acute cerebral injury. The potential structural similarity of technetium-99m-labeled glucaric acid (99mTc-glucarate) to that of fructose suggests that this agent may enter cells by a sugar transport system. Studies with LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated inhibition of 99mTc-glucarate uptake by fructose, confirming this potential relationship. Since anaerobic metabolism can use either glucose or fructose, we hypothesized that 99mTc-glucarate may concentrate in areas of acute ischemic injury. To test this hypothesis, 63 adult rats with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion were injected with 99mTc-glucarate and in vivo and ex vivo images were acquired. Seven animals were also studied with 18FDG and high resolution PET imaging. The radionuclide images were compared to the results of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and conventional histopathology. Thirty-five rats had significant accumulation of 99mTc-glucarate and no TTC staining (indicating infarction) in the involved hemisphere. Of the remaining 28 rats with TTC staining (suggesting viability) of the involved hemisphere, 16 (57%) had 99mTc-glucarate accumulation. In the seven rats that were studied with both 99mTc-glucarate and 18FDG, 99mTc-glucarate accumulated at the center of the occluded MCA territory while 18FDG activity was decreased in this region. These results suggest that 99mTc-glucarate is a sensitive marker of acute severe cerebral injury, but its mechanism of localization is probably different from that of 18FDG. 
2	Rectal examination in general practice OBJECTIVE--To investigate factors influencing a general practitioner's decision to do a rectal examination in patients with anorectal or urinary symptoms. DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--General practices in inner London and Devon. SUBJECTS--859 General practitioners, 609 (71%) of whom returned the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of rectal examinations done each month; the indication score, derived from answers to a question asking whether the respondent would do a rectal examination for various symptoms; and the confidence score, which indicated the respondent's confidence in the diagnosis made on rectal examination. RESULTS--279 General practitioners did five or fewer rectal examinations each month and 96 did more than 10 each month. Factors significantly associated with doing fewer rectal examinations were a small partnership and being a female general practitioner, and the expectation that the examination would be repeated. Lack of time in the surgery, and a waiting time of less than two weeks for an urgent outpatient appointment were also important. General practitioners were deterred from doing rectal examinations by reluctance of the patient (278), the expectation that the examination would be repeated (141), and lack of time (123) or a chaperone (39). Confidence in diagnosis was significantly associated with doing more rectal examinations, the perception of having been well taught to do a rectal examination at medical school, and being a male general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS--Factors other than clinical judgment influence the frequency of rectal examination in general practice. Rectal examination may become commoner with the trend towards larger group practices and if diagnostic confidence is increased and greater emphasis put on rectal examination in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching. 
1	Implementation of preventive services in an HMO practice. Practice does not conform to guidelines unless the guidelines are specifically implemented and performance is monitored. Several examples of implementation in one health maintenance organization (HMO) are given. These include immunization for influenza and follow up of positive screening tests for colorectal and cervical cancer. Each implementation effort has required the development of systems, which in this HMO are automated. Several issues influencing implementation are discussed, including resource constraints and priorities for the allocation of new resources. Developers cannot expect that their guidelines will be incorporated into clinical practice. They must foster specific implementation plans. 
1	Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium: report of a successful resection with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection. These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression. The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus. A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence. We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully. The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation. 
4	Angiocentric lymphoma with histologic features of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with predominant respiratory and hematologic manifestations. Report of a case and review of the literature Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare fatal disease characterized by widespread intravascular proliferations of neoplastic mononuclear cells. Clinically, dermatologic and bizarre neurologic manifestations usually predominate. The origin of the neoplastic cells remains still undetermined. The authors report a patient with NAE peculiar with respect to the following points: (1) the patient predominantly manifested respiratory symptoms and hematologic findings and lacked cutaneous or neurologic manifestations; and (2) immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies showed the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells, although previous cases with predominant respiratory or hematologic manifestations were reported to be of endothelial origin. Despite the rarity, this type of NAE or angiocentric lymphoma should be recognized because it is easily confused with other disorders, particularly vasculitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
1	Liver and pancreas: improved spin-echo T1 contrast by shorter echo time and fat suppression at 1.5 T. T1-weighted spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images have had limited soft-tissue contrast at 1.5 T. The authors investigated the effects of echo-time (TE) minimization and fat suppression on MR images of the liver and pancreas. Two sets of MR images were obtained with identical repetition times and other parameters. In 10 subjects with seven liver lesions, images with TEs of 20 and 12 msec were compared. In 18 additional subjects with seven liver lesions and five pancreatic carcinomas, images with identical TEs but with and without fat suppression were compared. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were greater with a TE of 12 msec than with a TE of 20 msec for liver versus spleen (7.6 vs 4.9, P = .014) and liver versus lesion (6.9 vs 3.9, P = .031). In patients without fatty liver, CNR for six lesions versus liver was greater (9.5 vs 6.0, P = .014) with fat suppression. CNR between glandular pancreas and cancer was most conspicuous with fat suppression, but fat planes were less distinct. Minimization of TE improves T1-weighted images significantly. Fat suppression also improves CNR, but the disadvantages of fat suppression do not allow elimination of conventional T1-weighted images. 
5	Fundoplication and gastrostomy in familial dysautonomia. Fundoplication with gastrostomy has become a frequent treatment for patients with familial dysautonomia, so we evaluated the use of both procedures in 65 patients. Although patients differed widely in presenting signs and age, from 5 weeks to 40 years, gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 95% of patients by cineradiography or pH monitoring. Panendoscopy was a useful adjunct. Preoperative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux included vomiting, respiratory infections, and exaggerated autonomic dysfunction. Severe oropharyngeal incoordination frequently coexisted and resulted in misdirected swallows with aspiration, dependence on gavage feedings, or poor weight gain and dehydration. Follow-up after surgical correction ranged from 3 months to 11 years; 55 patients (85%) were available for a 1-year postoperative assessment. We had no instances of surgical death. The long-term mortality rate was 14%, primarily related to severe preexisting respiratory disease. Beyond the first postoperative year, 30 patients had pneumonia attributed to continued aspiration, exacerbation of preexisting lung disease, or recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux. Of 11 patients who vomited postoperatively, six had recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux was documented in eight patients (12%), and we revised the fundoplication in three patients. The number of patients with cyclic crises was reduced from 18 to 7; retching replaced overt vomiting in all but two of these seven patients, neither of whom had recurrence of reflux. Because oropharyngeal incoordination was prominent, concomitant use of gastrostomy and an antireflux procedure was especially effective in the treatment of younger patients with familial dysautonomia, before the development of severe respiratory disease. Despite the development of severe morning nausea in 15 patients, the combination procedure resulted in significantly improved nutritional status, decreased vomiting, and decreased respiratory problems. Appropriate use of gastrostomy feedings also contributed to success of the operation. The generally good outcome of fundoplication with gastrostomy confirms the benefit of this procedure in familial dysautonomia. 
5	Recombinant human interleukin-1 induces meningitis and blood-brain barrier injury in the rat. Characterization and comparison with tumor necrosis factor. The diversity of infectious agents capable of inducing meningitis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury suggests the potential for a common host mediator. The inflammatory polypeptides, IL-1 and TNF, were tested in an experimental rat model as candidate mediators for induction of meningitis and BBB injury. Intracisternal challenge of rIL-1 beta into rats induced neutrophil emigration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly increased BBB permeability to systemically administered 125I-BSA as early as 3 h later (P less than 0.05). This injury was reversible, dose dependent and significantly inhibited by prior induction of systemic neutropenia (via intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide) or preincubation of the rIL-1 beta inoculum (50 U) with an IgG monoclonal antibody to rIL-1 beta. Similar kinetics and reversibility of CSF inflammation and BSA permeability were observed using equivalent dose inocula of rIL-1 alpha. rTNF-alpha was less effective as an independent inducer of meningitis or BBB injury over an inoculum range of 10(1) U (0.0016 micrograms/kg)-10(6) U (160 micrograms/kg) when injected intracisternally, but inoculum combinations of low concentrations of rTNF alpha (10(3) U) and rIL-1 beta (0.0005-5.0 U) were synergistic in inducing both meningitis and BBB permeability to systemic 125I-BSA. These data suggest that in situ generation of interleukin-1 within CSF (with or without TNF) is capable of mediating both meningeal inflammation and BBB injury seen in various central nervous system infections. 
4	Adverse haemodynamic effects of high-dose aprotinin in a paediatric cardiac surgical patient. High-dose aprotinin for reduction of intra- and postoperative blood loss was associated with profound hypotension and flushing in a 3.5-year-old child who underwent cardiac surgery. Treatment with noradrenaline and intravenous fluid was required. Cardiovascular stability was restored after 10 minutes. 
5	Tumor necrosis factor downregulates granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor expression on human acute myeloid leukemia cells and granulocytes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibits granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro. Incubation of blasts from three patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/ml), and subsequent binding studies using 125I-G-CSF reveal that TNF downregulates the numbers of G-CSF receptors by approximately 70%. G-CSF receptor numbers on purified blood granulocytes are also downmodulated by TNF. Downregulation of G-CSF receptor expression becomes evident within 10 min after incubation of the cells with TNF at 37 degrees C and is not associated with an apparent change of the dissociation constant (Kd). The TNF effect does not occur at 0 degrees C and cannot be induced by IL-2, IL-6, or GM-CSF. TNF probably exerts its effect through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as the TNF effect on G-CSF receptor levels can be mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate. The PKC inhibitor Staurosporine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as well as protease inhibitors can completely prevent G-CSF receptor downmodulation. Thus, it appears TNF may act as a regulator of G-CSF receptor expression in myeloid cells and shut off G-CSF dependent hematopoiesis. The regulatory ability of TNF may explain the antagonism between TNF and G-CSF stimulation. 
2	Duodenal ulcer is associated with low dietary linoleic acid intake. It has been suggested that the falling incidence and virulence of duodenal ulcer is related to increased dietary polyunsaturated essential fatty acid intake. The adipose fatty acid profile, which closely reflects dietary intake, was measured in 35 men with chronic duodenal ulcer and 35 matched control men. The mean percentage of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was significantly lower in the ulcer group (10.0 (0.7) v 12.3 (0.7)%, p less than 0.01) and this difference was found in both smokers and non-smokers. This finding suggests that the diets of duodenal ulcer patients are deficient in linoleic acid and this could be of aetiological importance. 
5	Epiretinal membrane contracture associated with macular prolapse. We treated two patients with annular epiretinal membranes that produced unusual macular morphologic characteristics. Contracture of the membranes caused herniation of macular tissue through a hole in the center of the membrane. The membranes were removed surgically, and ultrastructural analysis disclosed cells with properties resembling myofibroblasts and apparent new vitreous collagen. Contracture of the cellular components probably produced tangential traction on the retina, which caused prolapse of the retinal tissue through a central defect in the membrane. 
4	Brain and liver angiotensinogen messenger RNA in genetic hypertensive and normotensive rats. The brain's renin-angiotensin system in integrally involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid/mineral metabolism. Enhanced activity of the angiotensin system in the brain has been implicated as a possible source of the hypertension and the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, as compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rat. This study tested whether these inbred strains of hypertensive and normotensive rats differ in central or peripheral expression of the gene coding for angiotensinogen, the prohormone for the angiotensin peptides. Angiotensinogen messenger RNA was measured in the brain by in situ hybridization and in the liver by Northern blot analysis, using a synthetic oligonucleotide. There was a 28% greater expression of the angiotensinogen gene in the region of the anteroventral hypothalamus, preoptic area, and medial septum of the hypertensive strain. There were no differences between strains in liver angiotensinogen gene expression. These results are consistent with the possibility that enhanced elaboration of the angiotensin prohormone in the brain contributes, in part, to the hypertension or the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
1	Diagnostic value of anti-neuronal antibodies for paraneoplastic disorders of the nervous system. The diagnostic value of the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies in serum was examined in 21 patients suspected of paraneoplastic disorders of the nervous system (NS) (group 1) and was compared to three control groups; group 2: 25 patients with a neurological disease, without cancer and no sign of paraneoplastic disorder; group 3: 27 patients with neurological disease and cancer and no signs of a paraneoplastic disorder; group 4: 94 patients with cancer and without neurological disease. In group 1, anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies were detected in eight patients (38%), in titres from 1:1000 to 1:32,000. A small cell lung cancer was present in six patients, ovarian cancer in one patient and in one patient no tumour could be detected. The neurological symptoms preceded a diagnosis of cancer in five out of eight patients. Anti-neuronal antibodies were found in the serum of two out of 94 patients (2%) from control group 3 but not in serum from any of the other control groups. These data indicate a moderate sensitivity of 38%, but a high specificity of 98.6% (95% confidence interval 95.5-99.8%) for the presence of anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies if a paraneoplastic NS disorder is suspected. 
4	Role of magnetic resonance contrast agents in cardiac imaging. Improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology allow adequate spatial and temporal resolution to capture cardiac anatomy and contractile function in exceptional detail and with little risk. However, tissue characterization of the pathophysiologic state of the myocardium may require special indicators or MR contrast agents. These must be tailored for detection by the MRI process, but available agents are effective at low dose and provide a wide range of indicator properties (e.g., myocardial extracellular space, blood pool, capillary permeability and membrane transport). Each agent has a dynamic washin and washout time-intensity curve that may reflect myocardial perfusion or consequences of ischemia. The combined use of MRI and MR contrast agents may provide a single diagnostic examination that fully and quantitatively assesses all indexes of cardiac performance. Such information would be both global and regional, and would be well tolerated by patients. The cost, value and cost-effectiveness of such studies remain speculative. 
5	Diagnosis of chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis by rectal ultrasonography in relation to symptoms and findings. A group of 36 men with chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis, confirmed by semen analysis and rectal ultrasonography, underwent detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. There was no clear relationship between the severity of the symptoms or the presence of leucocytes and the extent of the changes visualised by ultrasound. In 72% of cases, clinical examination also revealed signs of a previous epididymitis. In general, asymmetry in symptoms could be related to glandular pathology, as indicated by ultrasonography, on the ipsilateral side. 
5	Long-term (5 to 20 years) Evolution of nongrafted aplastic anemias. The Cooperative Group for the Study of Aplastic and Refractory Anemias. In the presence of aplastic anemia (AA), therapeutic choices should be determined while taking into account not only changes for immediate improvement, but also both the risks for late-occurring complications and the following quality of life. We report here data concerning a long-term clinical survey (5 to 18 years with a median of 12 years) including 156 nongrafted patients receiving androgen therapy; all patients were alive more than 5 years after diagnosis (40% of patients included at time of diagnosis in our multicentric analysis). Between the 5th and the 13th year follow-up, 21 patients died of various causes either related to AA or to its treatment: 12 of infection or hemorrhage secondary to pancytopenia (6 relapses and 6 that had never been improved; 2 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]); 5 of leukemia; 1 of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 2 of late side effects following transfusion (1 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 1 chronic B hepatitis); and a single case of myocardial infarction (the latter could possibly result of androgen therapy). Thirteen patients in total developed PNH (among which 10 had clinical symptoms including 2 deaths, and 3 exhibited only biologic abnormalities). Few long-term side effects of androgens could be noticed. Adult height was normal in patients treated during childhood and so was young women's fertility. No malignant hepatoma occurred. This survey allows the recording of late spontaneous hematologic improvement (between 5 and 10 years of evolution). This occurred in 50% of patients that had remained cytopenic 5 years after diagnosis. Although bone marrow stem cell concentration remained abnormal after 10 years of evolution. 85% of patients had a normal red blood cell count, 80% a normal polymorphonuclear count, and 66% a normal platelet count. All patients who did not show late complications had an excellent quality of life. 
4	Purulent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade caused by Nocardia asteroides in mixed connective tissue disease. Pericardial nocardiosis is extremely rare, but may affect especially immunocompromised hosts. We describe the first reported case of purulent pericarditis with cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic nocardiosis in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. Our case emphasizes the importance of identifying infectious causes of pericarditis in patients with connective tissue diseases. Longterm survival was achieved with a combined medical and surgical approach. 
5	Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome: clinical and neuroradiologic features. We evaluated 11 patients with hemiparkinson-hemiatrophy syndrome, 6 with body and contralateral cerebral hemispheric hemiatrophy, 4 with only body hemiatrophy, and 1 with just brain hemiatrophy. The mean age of symptom onset was 38.1 years (range, 18 to 54) with 5.2 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SD) years of illness until the last follow-up visit. The presenting symptom was unilateral tremor in 6 patients, hand dystonia in 2, bradykinesia in 2, and abnormal gait in 1 patient. Three patients had a good response to levodopa, 4 had moderate response, and 2 patients had a poor response. During a mean follow-up period of 1.7 years (range, 4 months to 5 years), the Hoehn and Yahr score changed in only 3 patients: 2 gained 1.5 points and 1 gained 3 points over 2.5 years. We discuss the association between hemiparkinsonism-body hemiatrophy and contralateral hemispheric hemiatrophy, and raise the possibility of early childhood brain insult with delayed-onset parkinsonism. 
2	Hepatic involvement in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection: discrepancies between AIDS patients and those with earlier stages of infection. The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on type and severity of liver disease was studied in 61 HIV-positive patients who did not have AIDS and in 45 AIDS patients. Liver biopsies revealed viral hepatitis in 12 of 18 non-AIDS patients but in only 4 of 34 AIDS patients (P less than .0005, Fisher's exact test). Acute, non-A non-B, and chronic active hepatitis B were seen exclusively in the non-AIDS group; however, chronic persistent hepatitis B was seen in both groups. In 9 of 18 AIDS patients intra vitam liver histopathology established diagnoses of opportunistic infections or tumors. Tissue reaction to certain pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus, mycobacteria, and cryptococci, seems to be milder in AIDS patients than in others who are HIV positive or the expected reaction of the normal host. This is likely because of impaired cell-mediated immunity in patients with advanced HIV disease. 
5	Association between hypothermia and mortality rate of premature infants--revisited. The incidence of hypothermia (axillary temperature less than 35 degrees C) on admission of an infant to a neonatal intensive care unit was retrospectively analyzed in 559 very-low-birth-weight (less than 1500 gm) newborn infants. The smaller infants were at greater risk of hypothermia. Only in the larger neonates was mortality related to hypothermia, which suggests that this known association bears little cause-effect relationship. 
5	Lesions in side branches of arteries having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: a histopathologic study. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may cause occlusion in side branches. No histologic studies, however, have been made on side branches of the arteries in which PTCA has been performed. A histologic study was therefore made to explain the effect of PTCA on side branches. Histologic specimens were prepared by serial step sectioning from 15 side branches of 10 autopsied cases that had undergone PTCA. The results of examination by light microscope were as follows: (1) Stenoses due to PTCA were seen in seven branches (46.7%). (2) The stenoses were classified into three types: (a) stenosis due to blocking of the orifice of a side branch by the disrupted portion of the intima of the main artery (one branch); (b) stenosis due to medial dissection of the main artery or further dissection occurring even in the side branches (three branches); and (c) stenosis due to fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina of the main artery accompanied by proliferation of smooth muscle cells even in the side branch (three branches). It is now clear that stenosis is caused in side branches long after PTCA. Extra care is required when major side branches exist in the portion where this procedure is to be performed. 
4	Repair of coarctation with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch. Coarctation of the aorta with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries was treated surgically in a two-month-old boy with transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle. The aortic arch was repaired using side-to-side anastomosis of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, patch repair of the coarctated segment at the origin of the left subclavian artery, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus. Pulmonary arterial banding and balloon atrioseptostomy were performed for associated anomalies. 
4	Predictability and prognosis of PTCA-induced coronary artery aneurysms. The natural history of coronary aneurysms, defined as local dilatations exceeding the diameter of the normal adjacent vessel segments by at least 1.5 times, is not significantly different from the natural history of nonaneurysmal coronary disease. However, little is known about the prognosis of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA)-induced coronary aneurysms. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence and the medium long-term prognosis of such aneurysms in 728 patients who, after successful PTCA, underwent repeat coronary angiography at mean 4.5 months post-PTCA. A coronary aneurysm at the site of PTCA ws noted in 3.9% of patients (n = 28). Of the potentially predictive factors analyzed, only a coronary dissection at the time of PTCA had statistically significant influence. The long-term prognosis of PTCA-induced coronary aneurysms was excellent. One patient underwent (unrelated) cardiac surgery, all other 27 patients remained eventfree. We conclude that the same benign nature of coronary aneurysmal disease holds true for those aneurysms that develop after PTCA. 
5	Changes in haemostasis after stopping the combined contraceptive pill: implications for major surgery. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the changes in haemostasis in the three months immediately after stopping the combined contraceptive pill. DESIGN--Prospective randomised study. SETTING--Family planning centre in London. SUBJECTS--24 women aged 35-45 investigated before, during, and after six months' use of combined oral contraceptives containing 30 micrograms ethinyl oestradiol together with the progestogens desogestrel or gestodene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Blood samples were taken immediately before and after six months of oral contraceptive use and one, two, four, six, eight, and 12 weeks after the pill had been stopped. During the six months of oral contraceptive use the plasma concentration of factor X and fibrinogen increased and that of antithrombin III decreased. Between two and six weeks after stopping the pill a rebound phenomenon occurred with plasma concentrations of antithrombin III increasing (mean change from baseline at two weeks 0.06 IU/l and at six weeks 0.10 IU/l) and fibrinogen decreasing (0.26 g/l change at two weeks and 0.40 g/l at six weeks). Factor X concentrations fell gradually and the values at eight weeks were not significantly different from those found before the combined pill was started. CONCLUSION--The combined pill should be stopped at least four weeks before major surgery, which carries the risk of postoperative thrombosis, to allow the potentially prothrombotic haemostatic changes that occur during its use to be corrected. 
3	Antiepileptic medication in pregnancy: late effects on the children's central nervous system development. In a follow-up study long-term effects of antenatal exposure to two anticonvulsant drugs, phenobarbital and carbamazepine on central nervous system development were evaluated. Children aged 6 to 13 years of epileptic mothers who used phenobarbital (n = 13), carbamazepine (n = 12), phenobarbital plus carbamazepine (n = 12), or no medication (n = 24) during pregnancy were studied. None of the mothers had seizures during pregnancy. A control group carefully matched for confounding variables was selected of children of nonepileptic mothers (n = 61). Minor and major congenital anomalies appeared to be more related to mother's epilepsy than to maternal medication. There were no neurologic differences between the groups. Exposure to phenobarbital was associated with smaller head circumference. An accompanying negative effect of phenobarbital on cognitive development was suggested. Further research on this intriguing phenomenon seems warranted. 
2	Pain on common bile duct injection during ERCP: does it indicate sphincter of Oddi dysfunction? The reproduction of a patient's biliary-type pain upon initial injection of contrast material into the common bile duct during diagnostic ERCP is a dramatic experience for both patient and physician. The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP. Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated. We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection. There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes. Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. 
1	Prognosis of pregnancy-associated breast cancer. The survival of patients with pregnancy-associated (PA) breast cancer is difficult to predict for two reasons: The combination is very rare, and the natural history of breast cancer that is not associated with pregnancy is intricate and varies among individuals. Valid data collection and analysis is problematic given that studies gather patients over many years. The charts of 56 women with Stages I, II, and III breast cancer, who were pregnant or within 1 year postpartum at the time of breast cancer diagnosis between 1960 and 1980, were analyzed. Patients with PA breast cancer were compared to nonpregnant women of comparable ages, who were treated at the same hospital, by the same physicians, and during the same period. Four patients were lost before 5-year follow-up, and one patient before 10-year follow-up. These five patients had distant metastases at the time they were lost to follow-up, and are considered to have died within that time. Across stages, patients with PA breast cancer have survival not significantly different from those patients with non-pregnancy-associated (non-PA) breast cancer. 
2	Glutathione S-transferase. Novel vaccine against Fasciola hepatica infection in sheep. The potential of GST as a vaccine candidate against liver fluke infection in ruminants was studied by vaccinating sheep (n = 9) with GST purified from adult worms of Fasciola hepatica and challenging with 500 F. hepatica metacercariae. The immunization induced a high antibody response to GST in contrast to the poor or undetectable response to this Ag observed in naturally infected sheep. Throughout the trial, the progress of the fluke infection was monitored by measuring RBC hemoglobin levels, the extent of liver damage and the fecal egg output in the sheep. This analysis indicated that a subpopulation (n = 4) of the GST vaccinated animals exhibited no anemia, reduced liver damage and a lower mean fecal egg count relative to the infected control group suggesting a lower fluke burden in these animals. Worm burdens in the livers of the GST vaccine group (107 +/- 22) were 57% lower than in the infected control group (250 +/- 25). The subpopulation of the GST vaccine group demonstrated a 78% reduction in mean worm burdens relative to the control group. These results show that GST of adult F. hepatica is a novel Ag that can significantly protect sheep against liver fluke infection. The results suggest that the immune response to GST is directed to the juvenile worm reducing the number of worms that can establish in the liver of the vaccinated animals. 
1	Long-term follow-up of 24 patients undergoing radical resection for ampullary carcinoma, 1953 to 1988. Potentially curative radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary adenocarcinoma was performed in 24 patients over a 35-year period. The overall operative mortality was 12.5%. Actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 61% +/- 13.4 standard error of the mean (SEM) and subsequently remained unchanged. In the same time period, 21 patients underwent potentially curative radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary tumors of pancreatic origin. Similar analysis showed an overall operative mortality of 23.8% and a survival rate at 5 years of 27% +/- 12.5 SEM. The results of radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma in the most recent years (1976 to 1988) were compared with those of former years (1953 to 1975). There were no statistically significant differences in the 5-year survival rate; however, the operative mortality decreased from 25% in the former period to 6.3% in the recent period. Survival was dependent on nodal status. The 5-year survival rate was 78% +/- 11.5 SEM in the absence of nodal metastasis versus 50% +/- 25 SEM in the presence of regional nodal metastasis. These findings support the concept that radical pancreaticoduodenectomy offers a realistic probability for cure in a selected group of patients with carcinomas of the ampulla of Vater. 
4	Patient evaluation for cardiac transplantation. The aim for cardiac transplantation is to improve the quality of life and the survival in patients with end-stage heart failure. Given the scarcity of donor organ availability, the expense of the transplantation process and follow-up care, as well as the tremendous emotional burden the process places on a patient and his/her family, it is essential to carefully screen potential candidates for their symptomatic, functional, hemodynamic, and psychosocial eligibility, and to rule out coexisting hemodynamic or comorbid conditions that would jeopardize successful transplantation and immunosuppression. Comprehensive screening of potential transplant candidates, which is best accomplished by a multidisciplinary team approach working closely with patients and their families, is essential to insure that maximum benefit is derived from this scarce and valuable resource. 
1	Clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of trilateral retinoblastoma. In this report, three new cases of trilateral retinoblastoma are presented. The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of the patients are described and compared with those of 32 cases that have been previously reported in the literature. A positive family history was obtained in 68% of the patients. The mean age at diagnosis of bilateral retinoblastoma was 7.2 months. The mean age at diagnosis of trilateral disease was 39.7 months, resulting in a mean latent interval of 32.6 months. The mean time from diagnosis of trilateral retinoblastoma to death was 6.6 months, and all patients died with spinal metastases. The patients who received no therapy survived an average of 1.3 months after the diagnosis of trilateral disease. The patients who received any form of definitive therapy survived 9.7 months. Five patients who had complete or dramatic response to therapy by computed tomography scans had local intracranial tumor present at autopsy. Therefore, more aggressive local therapy may be warranted. 
5	Truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty combined with valvular replacement in patients with ulcer disease. In 1988, 5 patients (3 men and 2 women) with ulcer disease (mean age 56 +/- 8 years) underwent valvular replacement for aortic (No. = 4) or mitral disease (No. = 1). All patients had had gastroduodenal ulcers. Preoperative gastroscopy demonstrated active ulcers (No. = 4) and a healed pyloric ulcer with pyloric stenosis (No. = 1). Despite the presence of ulcers, a non-biologic prosthesis was preferred in each patient because of their young age (No. = 3), chronic atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy (No. = 1), and refusal of the eventuality of subsequent reoperation (No. = 1). In each patient, a truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was performed simultaneously with the valvular procedures by the same incision. The postoperative courses were uneventful. With a mean follow-up of 15 +/- 3 months, no gastrointestinal bleeding was observed during anticoagulant therapy. With anticoagulant drugs, bleeding may occur with a frequency of 4% per patient treatment-year, half of which are gastrointestinal in origin. Nevertheless, in selected patients with gastroduodenal ulcers, performing a vagotomy-pyloroplasty simultaneously with valvular replacement allows implantation of a non-biologic prosthesis, with greater durability than bioprosthesis. 
5	Chronic hypomagnesemia caused by cisplatin: effect of calcitriol. A group of six patients with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium less than or equal to 0.5 mmol/L), previously given treatment with cisplatin for ovarian or testicular cancer, received calcitriol at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 microgram/day for a period of 4 weeks to determine whether treatment with this vitamin D metabolite could improve their hypomagnesemia. In response to treatment, the serum magnesium concentration fell progressively in association with a rise in serum and urinary calcium levels and a decrease in parathyroid hormone level. In a single previous report, active vitamin D metabolites markedly improved renal magnesium wasting. However, in the present study, increases in serum and urinary calcium levels and suppression of parathyroid hormone, factors known to decrease magnesium reabsorption, presumably overwhelmed any direct effect calcitriol may have had to enhance magnesium reabsorption, so that the net effect was a marked exacerbation of the renal magnesium wasting. 
5	Reappraisal of the mechanism for cerebrospinal fluid hypertension during aortic surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypertension during aortic surgery is a poorly understood, multifactorial event that may increase the risk of spinal cord injury. To assess the factors that may contribute to changes in CSF pressure during aortic surgery, measurements of ascending arterial and CSF pressures were made in 17 anesthetized mongrel dogs. Changes in CSF patterns were monitored under several conditions tested in random sequence. These included systemic hypertension produced by an infusion of phenylephrine, cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta, and manual, superior displacement of the transverse aortic arch (arch elevation), either alone or in conjunction with the cross-clamp. Hypertension, cross-clamping, and cross-clamping combined with arch elevation all produced significant increases in ascending mean arterial pressure (204 +/- 20, 170 +/- 8, and 158 +/- 11 mm Hg, respectively, vs. 117 +/- 8 mm Hg [control]; (p less than 0.01). Small, nonsignificant increases in CSF pressure were detected in the cross-clamp group, but none were detected with hypertension alone, despite significant increases in ascending arterial blood pressure in both groups. Thus, neither arterial hypertension nor cross-clamping alone could be demonstrated directly to cause significant CSF hypertension. However, when aortic elevation (displacement) was combined with cross-clamping, the rise in CSF pressure increased to significant levels, even though the ascending arterial hypertension was least severe in this group. In contrast, arch elevation alone did not produce any significant increase in ascending arterial pressure but did produce an approximately 114% increase in CSF pressure (15.2 +/- mm Hg vs. 7.7 +/- 1 mm Hg [control]; p less than 0.01. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebral osteoblastoma: a report of two cases. Two patients with vertebral osteoblastoma evaluated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are presented. A literature review revealed that cases of osteoblastoma originating within the vertebral body are exceedingly rare. 
4	Exercise test predictors of ambulatory silent ischemia during daily life in stable angina pectoris. The predictive value of several exercise test parameters in identifying stable angina patients at risk of silent myocardial ischemia during daily life were examined. A total of 97 patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina and ambulatory electrocardiographic data were evaluated. Of the 86 patients with a positive exercise test, 39 (group 1) had greater than or equal to 1 episodes of ST-segment depression and 47 (group 2) did not develop ST changes during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Comparison of the exercise test parameters between the 2 groups revealed early onset of ischemia during exercise tests as the single most significant (p less than 0.0005) predictor of ambulatory silent ischemia. The other exercise test parameters showing significant differences between the 2 groups were the peak exercise heart rate (117 +/- 23 vs 126 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and peak systolic blood pressure (160 +/- 27 vs 176 +/- 27 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), both of which were significantly lower in the group 1 patients. These data were used to derive simple mathematical formulas for calculating the risk of ambulatory silent ischemia. These results demonstrate that stable angina patients at risk of silent ischemia during daily life can be accurately identified by evaluation of selected exercise test parameters. 
2	Experimental reduction of portal hypertension by mechanical increase of liver portal flow Studies on the isolated perfused rat liver demonstrated that an increase in portal pressure is associated with an increase in the portal blood flow in normal and in cirrhotic livers. In two pigs with portal hypertension mesenteric portal pressure was lowered by mechanically increasing the liver portal blood flow by means of a balloon pump around the portal vein. 
3	The influence of neutralizing heparin after carotid endarterectomy on postoperative stroke and wound hematoma. The influence of neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin after carotid endarterectomy on postoperative stroke and wound hematoma is unknown. During the past 6 years some of the authors frequently gave protamine sulfate to neutralize heparin, whereas others did not unless a patch was used or wound hemostasis was not readily obtained. To determine the influence of protamine sulfate on stroke and wound hematoma the records of 697 patients having a carotid endarterectomy from January 1984 to September 1989 were reviewed. Protamine sulfate was given to 328 patients, and 369 did not receive protamine sulfate. The incidence of stroke in the two groups was 1.8% (n = 6) and 2.7% (n = 10), respectively, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.6019). Excluding three strokes that could not be related to neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin, the difference remained insignificant (1.5% vs 2.2%, p = 0.7290). The incidence of wound hematoma was 1.8% (n = 6) in patients given protamine sulfate and 6.5% (n = 24) in patients not given protamine sulfate, and this difference was significant (p = 0.0044). The difference remained significant when three hematomas not related to protamine sulfate were excluded (1.2% vs 6.2%, p = 0.0013). In patients not given protamine sulfate draining the wound lessened the incidence of wound hematoma (4.4% vs 8.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1475). In patients given protamine sulfate the dose of protamine sulfate (15 to 45 mg vs 50 to 75 mg) had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of stroke (0.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.6530) or wound hematoma (1.6% vs 1.0%, p = 1.000). 
4	Mechanisms of blood flow during pneumatic vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Mechanisms of blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were studied in a canine model with implanted mitral and aortic flow probes and by use of cineangiography. Intrathoracic pressure (ITP) fluctuations were induced by a circumferential pneumatic vest, with and without simultaneous ventilation, and by use of positive-pressure ventilation alone. Vascular volume and compression rate were altered with each CPR mode. Antegrade mitral flow was interpreted as left ventricular (LV) inflow, and antegrade aortic flow was interpreted as LV outflow. The pneumatic vest was expected to elevate ITP uniformly and thus produce simultaneous LV inflow and LV outflow throughout compression. This pattern, the passive conduit of "thoracic pump" physiology, was unequivocally demonstrated only during ITP elevation with positive-pressure ventilation alone at slow rates. During vest CPR, LV outflow started promptly with the onset of compression, whereas LV inflow was delayed. At compression rates of 50 times/min and normal vascular filling pressures, the delay was sufficiently long that all LV filling occurred with release of compression. This is the pattern that would be expected with direct LV compression or "cardiac pump" physiology. During the early part of the compression phase, catheter tip transducer LV and left atrial pressure measurements demonstrated gradients necessitating mitral valve closure, while cineangiography showed dye droplets moving from the large pulmonary veins retrograde to the small pulmonary veins. When the compression rate was reduced and/or when intravascular pressures were raised with volume infusion, LV inflow was observed at some point during the compressive phase. Thus, under these conditions, features of both thoracic pump and cardiac pump physiology occurred within the same compression. Our findings are not explained by the conventional conceptions of either thoracic pump or cardiac compression CPR mechanisms alone. 
4	Elevated pulmonary artery pressure. An independent predictor of mortality. Analyses in this study were based on hemodynamic and angiographic data obtained in a cohort of 1,371 predominantly black patients during right and left heart catheterization. All patients were followed up prospectively for a mean of 117 weeks, and 103 fatal events were recorded. In Cox survival analysis, three variables were found to be independently related to survival: pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP), number of stenosed vessels, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (p less than 0.01); in multivariate stepwise analysis, PAMP entered the model first with the largest chi 2 value of the three prognostic variables (chi 2 = 33.4; p less than 0.0001). The PAMP was 32 percent higher in decedents compared with survivors (25 + 11 mm Hg vs 19 + 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 [mean, SD]) and a 10 mm Hg increase in PAMP was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the relative risk of dying; this finding was independent of pulmonary vascular resistance and therefore could not be attributed to primary pulmonary vascular or parenchymal disease. In both the subgroup of 1,118 patients with a normal LV ejection fraction (greater than 50 percent) and the 253 patients with a reduced ejection fraction (less than 50 percent), PAMP emerged as an independent predictor of mortality (p less than 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively), and is therefore a marker of cardiac disease beyond impairment of systolic contractile function. Among patients without obstructive coronary artery disease, PAMP alone provided prognostic information in the multivariate survival analysis. 
2	Diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum on supine abdominal radiographs. A blinded, retrospective study was performed to determine the value of supine abdominal radiographs in diagnosing pneumoperitoneum. Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant). One or more of these signs were present in 26 cases (59%) of pneumoperitoneum, including the right-upper-quadrant gas sign in 18 cases (41%), Rigler's sign in 14 cases (32%), and the falciform ligament and football signs in one case each (2%). Unfortunately, there were frequent errors in the interpretation of the right-upper-quadrant gas sign and Rigler's sign, with a total of 11 false-positive cases (13%). Further analysis of the true-positive right-upper-quadrant gas signs showed that these gas collections were always triangular or linear with an inferolateral to superomedial orientation and, if triangular, a concave superolateral border. In the true-positive Rigler's signs, the bowel wall thickness ranged from 1 to 8 mm, whereas the false positives all had a bowel wall thickness of 1 mm or less. Proper interpretation of the various signs of pneumoperitoneum on supine films should lead to more accurate diagnosis of this condition. 
4	Adrenergic stimulation of renal prostanoids in the Lyon hypertensive rat. Young, genetically hypertensive Lyon (LH) rats exhibited an increased renal in vivo turnover of norepinephrine and an elevated urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 when compared with normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure (LL) controls. Therefore, the effects of norepinephrine (1.2 x 10(-8) to 9.6 x 10(-7) M) and of phenylephrine (5 x 10(-8) to 1.9 x 10(-6) M) on renal function and the urinary excretion of prostanoids were assessed in isolated perfused kidneys of 8-week-old LH, LN, and LL rats. In addition, the effects of norepinephrine were assessed before and during thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor blockade by AH23848 (4 x 10(-6) M). Before drug infusion, LH kidneys differed from those of LN and LL controls by having an elevated renal vascular resistance and a decreased natriuresis and glomerular filtration rate; the urinary output of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha, of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and of thromboxane B2 was similar in the three strains. The constrictor effects of norepinephrine and phenylephrine were significantly increased in LH rat kidneys compared with LL but not with LN controls, and their pressure-natriuresis was markedly reduced. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine induced a 10- to 20-fold dose-dependent increase in the synthesis of the four prostanoids, which was more pronounced in LH than in LN and LL rats for thromboxane B2 only. AH23848 infusion significantly reduced the vascular effects of norepinephrine and increased the natriuretic response of LH but not of LN and LL rat kidneys. 
1	Adult hepatic fibropolycystic disease presenting as obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the common hepatic duct by a simple hepatic cyst in a 31 year old Europid man is reported. The jaundice and duct compression resolved after percutaneous aspiration of the cyst under ultrasound direction and the patient has been well for 12 months. 
4	Initial clinical evaluation of carotid artery laser endarterectomy. Clinical study of carotid artery laser endarterectomy began April 15, 1988. This report describes the first 10 cases that were performed in nine patients (five men and four women, mean age 70 years). Indications were asymptomatic stenosis (5), transient ischemic attacks (4), and stroke in evolution (1). There were two emergency cases and eight elective cases (including one reoperative case). Surgical exposure, systemic heparinization, vascular control, and a longitudinal arteriotomy were used. The cleavage plane between atheromas and media was developed with argon ion laser radiation (488 and 514.5 nm) directed through a 300 microns quartz fiber at power 1.0 W. Laser radiation was used to cut the atheromas out of the arteries and weld the end points. Residual atheromatous debris were vaporized with individual laser exposures. Arteriotomies were closed with sutures, and blood flow was restored. The endarterectomies were 3.9 +/- 1.1 cm long and required 330 +/- 97 joules. Mean clamp time was 22.5 +/- 7.9 minutes. Shunts were used in two cases. There were no arterial perforations or injuries as a result of laser light. Complications were hematoma (1), respiratory arrest (1), and transient neurologic deficit (1). Carotid endarterectomy is technically feasible with argon ion laser radiation. In the present series, postoperative observations, averaging 12 months and ranging from 5 to 19 months, have shown satisfactory results. No angiographic follow-up examinations were carried out. 
3	Reflex sympathetic dystrophy after clavicle fracture: case report. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the anterior chest wall is a rare entity. A MEDLINE search in all languages of the world's literature from 1966 to the present yielded no report of the association of clavicle fracture with this pain syndrome. Two cases are presented and the anatomic variations of the supraclavicular nerves in relation to the clavicle are discussed. 
5	Kinin/prostaglandin system: its therapeutic value in surgical stress. Multiple system organ failure as a consequence of injury or sepsis remains the major reason for death in critically ill patients. One of the treatment concepts that has recently attracted clinical attention is the administration of kinins and prostaglandins (PGs). On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress. However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce. On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients. Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing. It remains to be seen whether this concept will be useful in the treatment of critically ill surgical patients. 
5	Periventricular hyperintensity detected by magnetic resonance imaging in infancy. Twenty-one infants younger than 12 months of age were diagnosed as having periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Ten infants had experienced neonatal asphyxia, 6 intracranial hemorrhage, 2 bacterial meningitis, and 3 apnea. PVH was classified according to its extent. Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I). Continuous PVH was observed in 17 infants (PVH patterns II and III). Fourteen infants with continuous PVH had spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. Developmental delay was demonstrated in 15 infants with continuous PVH. No PVH pattern I infants had cerebral palsy; only 1 such infant had mild developmental delay. Our study suggests that the extent of PVH reflects the severity of brain damage in neonates with cerebral injuries. 
3	Visual illusions in a patient with lateral medullary syndrome. The disturbance of visual perception associated with nystagmus is a rare phenomenon. This is a case of a 61-year-old woman who developed progressive right hemisensory deficit, left facial sensory deficit, vertigo, staggering to the left, left ptosis, vertical diplopia, and ataxia of the left upper extremity. She had rotatory nystagmus in primary position, which increased in amplitude with left gaze. The above signs and symptoms were consistent with lateral medullary syndrome. During her rehabilitation, the patient complained of visual disturbances typical of oscillopsia. These disturbances, or illusions, are compensatory mechanisms for nystagmus and its resultant retinal error. The purpose of this case presentation was to study the pathophysiology underlying oscillopsia in patients with nystagmus and to stimulate awareness of such visual disturbances in stroke patients. 
2	Nonoperative management of small-bowel obstruction with endoscopic long intestinal tube placement. Intestinal obstruction remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. We reviewed the records of 77 patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction who were treated with endoscopically and fluoroscopically placed Leonard long intestinal tube decompression. Most patients (59%) had failed a trial of nasogastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube decompression. Overall, 29 per cent of patients were able to resolve their obstruction with Leonard tube decompression alone. Subdivision of patients on the basis of the etiology of their obstruction demonstrated a much higher rate of success for tube decompression in adhesive obstruction (37%) versus malignant obstruction (12%) or inflammatory obstruction (no successes). Patients with radiographic and clinical evidence of complete intestinal obstruction were significantly less likely to respond to long intestinal tube treatment (13%). The long intestinal tube was easily passed in all patients. There were no complications of the intubation procedure in our series, and the incidence of tube-related complications was four per cent. We conclude that an initial period of long intestinal tube decompression allows a significant percentage of patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction to be treated nonoperatively, particularly if a partial obstruction from postoperative adhesions is present. Patients who have failed a trial of nasogastric tube decompression and are poor operative risks should also be considered for long intestinal tube placement. 
1	Years of potential life lost: another indicator of the impact of cutaneous malignant melanoma on society. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) is an indicator of premature mortality that complements traditional incidence and mortality rates and that facilitates comparisons among different cancers. We calculated YPLL from cutaneous melanoma and 11 other cancers routinely recorded and tracked by Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). YPLL from cutaneous melanoma ranked eighth for persons younger than 65 years of age and fourth for those 20 to 49 years of age. An average of 17.1 YPLL per death were due to melanoma, one of the highest rates for adult-onset cancers. The results of our study, the first to apply YPLL to cutaneous melanoma, emphasize the disproportionate impact of this cancer on young and middle-aged adults and reemphasize the importance of this cancer as a public health priority. 
1	Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration: a clinical comparison of patients with and without Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibodies. In a review of 32 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), 16 (all of whom were women) had Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibodies (PCAb) and 16 (8 women) did not. Most patients (15 of 16 seropositive and 12 of 16 seronegative patients) had active cancer at the time of neurologic diagnosis. Gynecologic or breast cancers were found in 14 of 16 seropositive and in 2 of 8 seronegative female patients; lung cancer was diagnosed in 7 of 16 seronegative patients but in no seropositive patient. In seropositive patients, the onset of the syndrome was more often abrupt and abnormalities of affect, mentation, ocular motility, and cerebrospinal fluid IgG index were more common than in seronegative patients. Additional paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes were present in five seronegative patients but in no seropositive patient. Clinical impairment was equivalent in both groups; approximately 75% of patients were confined to a wheelchair or bed at last follow-up. Four of 16 seropositive patients died (4 to 18 months after onset of PCD), and 7 of 16 seronegative patients died (7 to 120 months after onset of PCD). Thus, PCAb seem to be a marker for a clinical subset of female patients with gynecologic or breast cancer. The high frequency of other autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes in patients with seronegative PCD suggests that PCD in both seropositive and seronegative patients may have a common pathogenic basis that involves an as yet unidentified antineuronal autoimmune mechanism. 
5	Severity of meningococcal disease: assessment by factors and scores and implications for patient management. Results from our own and other published series of cases of meningococcal disease were used to study prognostic factors and to compose scores for assessment of severity of disease on admission to the hospital. The difference in risk for fatality was designated the factor fatality difference (FFD); the FFD was determined by subtracting the percent fatality for factor-negative patients from the percent fatality for factor-positive patients. FFD was useful for selection of good indicators of severity of disease. Blood pH of less than 7.35 was the best single factor; low platelet count came next, followed by low blood pressure, cyanosis, ecchymosis, and low blood leukocyte count. New scores were constructed based on multiple regression analyses. Several older and new scores seemed to be comparable. By combining age-adjusted systolic blood pressure (less than 100 mm Hg), cyanosis, ecchymosis, diarrhea before or at admission, cold extremities, absence of nuchal or back rigidity, and rectal temperature of greater than or equal to 40 degrees C, a simple bedside percentage score, the MenOPP bedside clinical score (MOC), was devised. Cross-evaluations on test materials generally confirmed the choice of score. The simplicity of this score made it more clinically suitable than laboratory or mixed laboratory and bedside scores. 
3	Prognosis and prognostic factors of retinal infarction: a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE--To determine the prognosis and adverse prognostic factors in patients with retinal infarction due to presumed atheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--University hospital departments of clinical neurology. PATIENTS--99 patients with retinal infarction, without prior stroke, referred to a single neurologist between 1976 and 1986 and evaluated and followed up prospectively until death or the end of 1986 (mean follow up 4.2 years). INTERVENTIONS--Cerebral angiography (55 patients), aspirin treatment (37), oral anticoagulant treatment (eight), carotid endarterectomy (13), cardiac surgery (six), and peripheral vascular surgery (two). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, stroke, coronary events, contralateral retinal infarction; survival analysis confined to 98 patients with retinal infarction due to presumed artheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism (one patient with giant cell arteries excluded), and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis, including age as a prognostic factor. RESULTS--During follow up 29 patients died (21 of vascular causes and eight of non-vascular or unknown causes), 10 had a first ever stroke, 19 had a coronary event, and only one developed contralateral retinal infarction. A coronary event accounted for more than half (59%) of the deaths whereas stroke was the cause of only one death (3%). Over the first five years after retinal infarction the actuarial average absolute risk of death was 8% per year; of stroke 2.5% per year (7.4% in the first year); of coronary events 5.3% per year, exceeding that of stroke; and of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death 7.4% per year. Prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of death were increasing age, peripheral vascular disease, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit. Adverse prognostic factors for serious vascular events were increasing age and carotid bruit for stroke, and increasing age, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit both for coronary events and for stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. CONCLUSIONS--Patients who present with retinal infarction due to presumed atherothromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism are at considerable risk of a coronary event. The risk of stroke, although high, is not so great. Not all strokes occurring after retinal infarction relate directly to disease of the ipsilateral carotid system, although this is probably the most common cause. Few patients experience contralateral retinal infarction. Non-arteritic retinal infarction should be diagnosed or confirmed by an ophthalmologist, and the long term care of patients with the condition should involve a physician who has an active interest in managing vascular disease. 
2	Genital herpes simplex virus infections. There has been a dramatic increase in patient visits to physicians for evaluation and treatment of genital herpes infections. This has resulted in part from an increase in genital herpes infections, particularly severe, first-episode genital herpes infections in adults without prior HSV-1 infection. Virus culture remains the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis, and use of viral cultures is encouraged. Type-specific antibody tests have been employed in studies documenting the role of asymptomatic shedding of HSV in transmission of genital infections, the role of genital HSV in transmission of HIV, the predominance of asymptomatic and unrecognized infections in those infected with HSV-2, and the presence of past asymptomatic or unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 in 25% of persons presenting with first-episode genital herpes. Unfortunately, commercially available serologic tests do not reliably differentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recent studies suggest that the annual risk of transmission from a sexual partner with genital herpes is about 10% in heterosexual couples. Currently, promotion of "safe sex" is the only available approach for prevention of transmission. However, ongoing research is focused on the development of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir should be used routinely in persons with first-episode genital herpes, but careful evaluation is needed in persons with recurrent genital herpes to determine whether episodic or suppressive treatment is indicated. Acyclovir should also be used routinely for episodic or suppressive treatment of HSV infections in persons with AIDS. Additional antiviral agents are needed for more effective suppressive therapy and for treatment of ACV-resistant HSV infections in the immunocompromised host. 
3	The effect of an alpha-2 agonist on bladder function and cord histology after spinal cord injury [retracted by Weiss R, Tomasula JJ, Sotologo JR Jr. In: J Urol 1991 Aug;146(2):426] Spinal injury in cats is accompanied by urinary bladder and hind limb dysfunction. Ten cats subjected to spinal contusion at the ninth thoracic segment were treated with guanabenz (an alpha-2 agonist) intraperitoneally (0.65 mg./kg.) three hours after injury, and twice daily for eight weeks. An additional six spinal cats were untreated and served as controls. Urodynamic studies were performed on a weekly basis on all animals. Guanabenz modified the vesico-somatic reflex: detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was either ablated or abolished. In contrast, the controls demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, high residual urine, and spasticity below the lesion. Histological evaluations of the spinal cords revealed that the six paraplegic animals (untreated) suffered marked cavitation of the cord and complete destruction of the grey matter. The five incomplete paraplegic animals (treated) showed minimal cavitation with some preservation of the grey matter. The five ambulators (treated) demonstrated some distortion of grey matter with preservation of white matter. Treatment with guanabenz post traumatic cord injury results in decreased cord cavitation. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia is diminished and hind limb function is improved in treated animals. 
2	Treatment of severe peptic esophageal stricture with Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy, vagotomy, and endoscopic dilation. A follow-up study Eleven patients with dysphagia caused by severe esophageal stricture (length 2 to 10 cm) resulting from reflux esophagitis were treated with fibroendoscopic dilation (Eder-Puestow) and Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy with vagotomy during 10 years (1979 to 1988). There was no operative mortality, but complications developed in three patients: One patient had a mediastinal abscess demanding thoracotomy as a result of esophageal perforation after dilatation; one had postoperative pneumonia; and one patient had ileus. After a mean follow-up of 4 years (range 1 to 10 years) esophagitis healed in all cases, as judged by endoscopy. Eight patients were asymptomatic, but three had slight transient dysphagia. Postoperatively one to eight dilations (average three to four) were needed to relieve dysphagia in the first postoperative year, but later the stricture healed in every case. Postoperative pH measurement was performed in six latest patients and showed complete absence of reflux in all cases. It is concluded that Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy with vagotomy and endoscopic dilation is an effective, simple, and safe procedure in the management of severe peptic esophageal (acid or alkaline esophagitis) stricture. However, occasional postoperative dilations at the outpatient clinic are often needed in severe cases in the first postoperative year. 
4	Efficacy and safety of doxazosin in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol. In hypertensive patients, elevated serum cholesterol is a frequent and sinister additional coronary risk factor. Selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor inhibitors appear to have the unique ability to control both risk factors. Forty-two patients, ages 42 to 65 years, including 21 men with sustained hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels, were included in a trial of monotherapy with doxazosin administered once daily (range, 1 to 16 mg). The influence of the drug on high blood pressure and elevated serum cholesterol was evaluated over a 28-week period, which consisted of a 4-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, an open 10-week dose-adjustment period, and finally a 14-week maintenance period. Of the 39 efficacy-evaluable patients, 25 (64%) achieved adequate blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) at a mean daily dose of 2 mg of doxazosin. No persistent changes occurred in heart rate. In the 32 patients with evaluable lipid data, there were nonsignificant trends to an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a reduction in total cholesterol, together with a significant reduction in serum triglyceride concentration. The combined changes in blood pressure and blood lipid levels resulted in a reduction of 36% in the calculated risk of coronary heart disease. Eleven patients reported side effects and four were withdrawn from therapy. These results confirm the antihypertensive and anticholesterolemic efficacy of once-daily treatment with doxazosin. 
5	Perirectal abscess in Crohn's disease. Drainage and outcome. The role of surgical intervention in the treatment of patients with anorectal Crohn's disease is controversial. To clarify the success of aggressive drainage and the subsequent clinical course of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscesses, the authors reviewed the records of 38 patients who presented with this condition during an eight-year period. Twenty-two male and 16 female patients (median age, 32 years; range, 17 to 61 years) with clinically or pathologically confirmed Crohn's disease of the bowel underwent operation for perirectal abscesses. Thirty-two percent of patients had no previous history of anorectal Crohn's disease. Thirty simple abscesses and 8 complex horseshoe abscesses were treated. At operation, 53 percent of patients underwent incision and drainage whereas 26 percent received loop indwelling drains and 21 percent had mushroom catheters placed. After resolution of the index abscess, recurrent abscesses occurred in 45 percent of the patients who underwent catheter drainage and 56 percent of the patients who underwent incision and drainage. More importantly, 44 percent of the incision and drainage group and only 31 percent of the catheter drainage group required subsequent proctectomy to control perineal sepsis. The healing time of the perineal wound was longer than six months in 83 percent of patients requiring rectal excision. We concluded that long-term catheter drainage may offer substantial benefit in the overall outcome of the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscess. 
5	Transforming growth factor beta 1 suppresses acute and chronic arthritis in experimental animals. Systemic administration of the cytokine, TGF beta 1, profoundly antagonized the development of polyarthritis in susceptible rats. TGF beta 1 administration (1 or 5 micrograms/animal), initiated one day before an arthritogenic dose of streptococcal cell wall (SCW) fragments, virtually eliminated the joint swelling and distortion typically observed during both the acute phase (articular index, AI = 2.5 vs. 11; P less than 0.025) and the chronic phase (AI = 0 vs. 12.5) of the disease. Moreover, TGF beta 1 suppressed the evolution of arthritis even when administration was begun after the acute phase of the disease. Histopathological examination of the joint revealed the systemic TGF beta 1 treatment greatly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation, and joint erosion. Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into the synovium, TGF beta 1 reversed the leukocytosis associated with the chronic phase of the arthritis. Control animals subjected to the same TGF beta 1 dosing regimen displayed no discernable immunosuppressive or toxic effects even after 4 wk of treatment. These observations not only provide insight into the immunoregulatory effects of TGF beta, but also implicate this cytokine as a potentially important therapeutic agent. 
5	Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in relation to previous use of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Catalan Countries Study on Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding To assess the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of individual non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a multicentre study of 875 cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 2682 hospital controls was done. With control for confounding factors, the overall odds ratio estimate for aspirin taken at least once during the week before the first symptom was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 5.4-9.6). Non-aspirin NSAIDs associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were diclofenac (7.9 [4.3-14.6]), indomethacin (4.9 [2.0-12.2]), naproxen (6.5 [2.2-19.6]), and piroxicam (19.1 [8.2-44.3]). Paracetamol, propyphenazone, and dipyrone did not increase the risk. A previous history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer did not greatly affect odds ratio estimates, which differed according to sex and were higher for younger than for older patients. However, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was higher among the elderly. 
3	Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. 
2	The risk of large bowel cancer after partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. The relative risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for colorectal cancer after partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease was examined in a population-based cohort comprising 6459 patients operated during 1950 to 1958. Follow-up through 1983 revealed 131 cases of colorectal cancer versus 150.3 expected cases (SIR = 0.87; 95% confidence limits 0.73, 1.03). The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself. 
1	Expression of VLA-alpha 2, VLA-alpha 6, and VLA-beta 1 chains in normal mucosa and adenomas of the colon, and in colon carcinomas and their liver metastases. 'Very late antigen' (VLA) proteins are members of the integrin superfamily with cell-surface receptor function and are involved in the cell-cell matrix interaction. They are heterodimers with a common beta 1 chain and different alpha chains counted through VLA-1 to VLA-6. The VLA-2 complex (alpha 2/beta 1) was found to act as collagen receptor on platelets and the VLA-6 complex (alpha 6/beta 1) as laminin receptor. Using monoclonal antibodies and an indirect immunoperoxidase method, we investigated the expression of VLA-alpha 2, VLA-alpha 6, and VLA-beta 1 chains in 20 normal colonic mucosa samples, in 20 colonic adenomas, and in 96 carcinomas together with 10 accompanying liver metastases. All three proteins were expressed throughout the colonic epithelium, except for VLA-alpha 2, which was present in the cryptic gland but was absent on the mucosal surface in some cases. In general, adenomas were strongly positive for the VLA proteins but 3 of 20 cases showed focal VLA-alpha 2-negative areas. The carcinomas revealed considerable heterogeneity of VLA-alpha 2 expression; ie, 59 tumors were completely positive, 35 tumors revealed a focal loss of antigen, and 2 cases were negative. This reduced antigen expression was statistically associated with Dukes' stage C/D (P = 0.003). VLA-alpha 6 was expressed throughout in all tumors. VLA-beta 1 was found extensively expressed in 77 carcinomas, partially expressed in 17 carcinomas, and was absent in 2 carcinomas. As compared to their primary tumors, liver metastases showed roughly corresponding patterns of antigen expression. The down regulation/loss of VLA proteins in a subset of epithelial colon tumors might cause a disturbed cell-cell/cell-matrix interaction that might augment the invasive property of their cells. 
2	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory gastropathy: from theory to practice. The success of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in managing joint inflammation and pain has come at the cost of impressive side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. This manuscript reviews the magnitude of the problem, the risk factors, and presentation of nonsteroidal gastropathy. It also presents some points in the prevention and management of the disorder. 
2	Divergent efficacy of antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha in intravascular and peritonitis models of sepsis. The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in the lethal consequences of intravascular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Escherichia coli sepsis was compared with that in bacterial peritonitis. Intravenous administration of E. coli LPS or E. coli (live or dead) resulted in large transient increases in serum TNF alpha levels, peaking at 90 min at 10,000-30,000 units/ml. In contrast, the serum TNF alpha response following the induction of bacterial peritonitis was substantially less, peaking at 200-500 units/ml. Sterile peritonitis (essentially nonlethal) and bacterial peritonitis (greater than 60% lethal) elevated TNF alpha levels to 1000-2000 units/lavage within the peritoneal cavity 2 h after challenge. Passive immunization with neutralizing goat anti-TNF alpha IgG improved survival from 8% to 75% in rats administered LPS intravenously but was completely ineffective in protecting rats from lethal E. coli peritonitis. Thus significant differences exist in the role TNF alpha plays in systemic intravascular models of sepsis and bacterial peritonitis. 
4	Prospective study of quality of life before and after coronary artery bypass grafting OBJECTIVES--Measurement of changes in patients' perceptions of how differing states of health affect their lives and determination of the ability of preoperative variables to predict outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting. DESIGN--Prospective study with completion of questionnaires before coronary artery bypass grafting and at three months, one year, and five years afterwards. SETTING--Regional cardiothoracic centre. PATIENTS--100 Male patients all aged below 60 at the time of operation, who were patients of two cardiothoracic surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patients' assessment of their health state in terms of functional capacity and aspects of distress, according to the Nottingham health profile and outcome of operation in terms of changes in symptoms, working life, and daily activities determined by self completed study questionnaires before operation and at three and six months afterwards. RESULTS--Intermediate one year results are reported. The differences between the Nottingham health profile scores before operation and at three months afterwards were significantly different (p less than 0.01), indicating an appreciable improvement in general health state, and at one year compared favourably with those from a normal male population. Analysis of responses to the study questionnaire showed that 65 of 89 patients (73%) were working at one year after operation with a further seven (8%) maintaining that they were fit to work but unable to find employment. The proportion of patients complaining of chest pain fell from 90% (88/98) before grafting to 19% (17/89) at one year after coronary artery bypass grafting, when 91% (81/89) patients maintained that their condition was either completely better or definitely improved. The significant positive factors affecting return to work and home activities were working before operation, short wait for operation, absence of breathlessness, and low physical mobility score in the Nottingham health profile (all p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS--Improvements were evident in general health state, symptoms, and activity at three months and one year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Interventions likely to influence outcomes included reduction in waiting times for operation; rehabilitation initiatives; and more attention to the quality of information given to patients, their relatives, and the community. 
4	Increase of calmodulin activator in hypertension. Modulation by dietary sodium and calcium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM. In the presence of exogenously added CaM, lipidic extracts from the SHM heart showed augmented CaM-PDE activity relative to normotensive preparations. This difference was eliminated by trifluoperazine. 
5	Recognising failure to thrive in early childhood. The maximum weight centile achieved by a child between 4 and 8 weeks of age was found to be a better predictor of the centile at 12 months than the birth weight centile. Children whose weight deviated two or more major centiles below this maximum weight centile for a month or more showed significant anthropometric differences during the second year of life from those who showed no such deviation. It is suggested that this leads to a logical and practical definition of failure to thrive. 
4	Control of hypertensive emergencies Although uncommon, hypertensive emergencies require prompt recognition and treatment to reduce very high morbidity and mortality rates. Admission to an intensive care unit for treatment and monitoring is essential for optimal care. A Swan-Ganz catheter is often helpful in management. Intravenous nitroprusside sodium (Nipride, Nitropress) is probably the drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies other than those due to eclampsia or pheochromocytoma. 
5	Hoarseness as the sole presenting symptom of foramen magnum meningioma. Foramen magnum tumours are rare. They may present with bizarre symptoms and mimic many conditions. We report a presentation with the sole complaint of hoarseness, never previously described in the literature. Voice returned to normal after surgical removal of the foramen magnum meningioma. 
4	The effects of age and peripheral vascular disease on the circulatory and mechanical response of skin to loading. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues of amputation residual limbs are required to withstand externally applied loads of greater magnitude than similar tissues of the intact lower limb. Increased age and poor circulatory status may contribute to the increased risk of tissue injury seen in this population. This study evaluates the effects of age and circulatory status as risk factors for skin injury resulting from externally applied forces. Twelve young control (YC), six elderly control (OC) and 11 subjects with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were studied. After base-line ankle arm index (AAI) measurements, TcPO2 electrodes were applied 10 cm below the knee over the medial surface of the tibia and the muscle belly of tibialis anterior. TcPO2 measurements and tissue displacements were obtained under the influence of incremented, normally oriented, external loads. The sensitivity of the tissues to applied loads was determined by calculating the load at which the TcPO2 reached zero. The stiffness of the tissues (displacement/load) was calculated under high (greater than 40 mm Hg) and low (less than 20 mm Hg) loading conditions. No difference was noted in tissue sensitivity to applied loads between the OC and YC populations. The TcPO2 decreased to zero in the PVD population at significantly lower applied loads than both the OC and YC populations. The tissue stiffness of the PVD and the OC populations over bone was greater than the YC population, but no significant differences were noted between the PVD and the OC populations. In summary, increased age does not result in a greater tissue sensitivity to externally applied loads, in spite of the demonstrated increased tissue stiffness. 
1	Detection of somatic DNA alterations in ovarian cancer by DNA fingerprint analysis. The M13 phage single-strand DNA probe which recognizes highly polymorphic loci was applied to HinfI-digested DNA isolated from tumor tissue and peripheral leukocytes from 20 patients with ovarian cancer. An average of 22 minisatellite-containing DNA fragments were observed per individual. DNA fingerprint analysis revealed a change in restriction-fragment-length patterns in the DNA from 12 of 20 (60%) tumors compared with the patient's constitutional DNA. Deletion of one or more bands from the tumor was recognized by the probe in seven cases, new bands were identified in two, and intensity shift was demonstrated in eight. The authors conclude that the unmapped M13 minisatellite probe is a useful method for identifying cancer-related somatic DNA alterations. 
3	Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. 
4	Microangiopathy in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe our pathologic study of skin, fascial, and muscle biopsies from 21 patients evaluated by light microscopy, histochemistry, and electron microscopy. A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present. This microangiopathy suggests that ischemia may be a contributing factor to the findings in this syndrome. 
4	Ischemic intestinal complications in patients with burns. Enteral bacterial translocation has been implicated as a major cause of morbidity in instances of trauma, but little clinical evidence of the loss of intestinal mucosal integrity has been documented. A retrospective review of the medical and autopsy records of all patients admitted between 1982 and 1988 was performed to describe the incidence of intestinal pathologic findings. Of all deaths, a total of 53 per cent of adults (greater than 18 years old) and 61 per cent of children (zero to 17 years old) were noted to have ischemic intestinal pathologic findings on autopsy, ranging from superficial necrosis to full thickness mucosal necrosis extending into the omentum. More than 80 per cent of these patients were septic at the time of death, with endogenous intestinal flora species most frequently identified as the causative agent. Less than 1 per cent (n = 16) of the patients admitted were clinically identified with intestinal pathologic examination, surgically explored and underwent resection of the intestine. Despite intervention, this group suffered a 69 per cent mortality rate. Although the documentation of bacterial translocation in a human model may be obscured by other potential sources of contamination, for example, burn wound, in combination with the immunosuppression inherent to the thermally injured, may lead to bacterial contamination of the systemic circulation and, therefore, may be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality after thermal injury.

1	Technique of photodynamic therapy for disseminated intraperitoneal malignant neoplasms. Phase I study. Patients with disseminated intraperitoneal malignant neoplasms were given intra-abdominal photodynamic therapy. Patients received dihematoporphyrin ethers intravenously 48 to 72 hours before laparotomy at doses of 1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg. At operation, as much tumor as possible was resected. Red light (630 nm) was delivered to all peritoneal surfaces from an argon-pumped dye laser at doses ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 J/cm2 in an escalating fashion. Viscera and peritoneal surfaces were anatomically isolated and exposed to light for intervals calculated to deliver the prescribed energy. Light was delivered to mesentery and bowel by a flat-cut optical fiber, while other areas, including diaphragm, viscera, omental bursa, gutters, and pelvis, were delivered light through a diffusing wand. Twenty-three patients (13 with ovarian cancer, eight with sarcoma, and two with pseudomyxoma peritoneii) underwent photodynamic therapy. Five of eight patients cleared positive peritoneal cytologies after treatment. Six patients remained clinically free of disease for up to 18 months, and five patients had treatment-related complications. Intraperitoneal phototherapy is technically feasible and deserving of clinical evaluation. 
1	A high prevalence of antibody to the hepatitis C virus in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. In Japan, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers, with a reported fatality rate showing a consistent and significant increase in the last decade. At most, only 25% of HCC cases are positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). To investigate a potential role for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the development of HCC, sera from 105 HBsAg-negative HCC patients were collected from five districts of Japan and assayed for antibody to HCV antigen (HCVAb). A large number of these patients (76.2%) were found to be positive for the HCVAb in comparison with the reported prevalence in sera from blood donors (1.1%). A history of blood transfusion was found in 39.6% of the cases positive for HCVAb, which was significantly different to the lower rate (4.7%) observed in HCC patients who were both positive for HBsAg and negative for HCVAb (P less than 0.001). 
4	Does intracoronary infusion of Fluosol-DA 20% prevent left ventricular diastolic dysfunction during coronary balloon angioplasty? Distal intracoronary infusion of the perfluorochemical Fluosol-DA 20% has been shown to prevent systolic dysfunction during coronary artery balloon occlusion in coronary angioplasty. To assess its effect on global diastolic dysfunction, a randomized, single-blind, crossover protocol comparing intracoronary infusion of Fluosol or no infusion (control) was performed during 60 s balloon inflations in 10 patients (mean age 67 years) undergoing coronary angioplasty. Assessment of global systolic and diastolic function was obtained with high fidelity micromanometer measurements of left ventricular pressure. Eighteen pairs of balloon inflations (Fluosol versus control) were analyzed. Patients reported significantly less severe chest pain during inflations accompanied by Fluosol compared with control. However, during coronary balloon occlusion, no significant differences in the changes from baseline values were observed between Fluosol and control with regard to ventricular relaxation, including the time constant of early ventricular relaxation (tau) and maximal rate of fall in left ventricular pressure (maximal negative dP/dt). No differences between Fluosol and control were observed in terms of the increase in end-diastolic pressure or minimal diastolic pressure during balloon inflation. Mean systolic pressure decrease from baseline values was greater during control than during Fluosol inflations (-9.0 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p = 0.013), but no significant difference was observed in the change in maximal rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (maximal positive dP/dt). These results suggest that Fluosol does not preserve global left ventricular diastolic function during coronary balloon occlusion, possibly because of its limited oxygen delivery capability relative to arterial blood. 
4	Clinical significance of plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with exercise-induced ischemia. To assess the fibrinolytic system in patients with exercise-induced ischemia and its relation to ischemia and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), 47 patients with CAD confirmed by results of coronary angiography underwent symptom-limited multistage exercise thallium-201 emission computed tomography. All patients with CAD had exercise-induced ischemia as assessed from thallium-201 images. Pre- and peak exercise blood samples from each patient and preexercise blood samples from control subjects were assayed for several fibrinolytic components and were also assayed for plasma adrenaline. The extent of ischemia was defined as delta visual uptake score (total visual uptake score in delayed images minus total visual uptake score in initial images) and the severity of CAD as the number of diseased vessels. In the basal condition, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity was significantly higher in patients with exercise-induced ischemia as compared to control subjects (p less than 0.01), although there were no significant differences in other fibrinolytic variables between the two groups. Moreover, PAI activity in the basal condition displayed a significantly positive correlation with the extent of ischemia (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01). Patients with exercise-induced ischemia were divided into two groups (24 with single-vessel disease and 23 with multivessel disease). There were no significant differences in coronary risk factors, hemodynamics, or plasma adrenaline levels during exercise between single-vessel and multivessel disease except that delta visual uptake score was significantly higher in multivessel disease (p less than 0.01). 
3	Mapping the distribution of amobarbital sodium in the intracarotid Wada test by use of Tc-99m HMPAO with SPECT. The intracarotid amobarbital sodium, or Wada, test has been used to localize speech and memory function prior to surgical treatment of temporal lobe seizures. The authors mixed technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) with amobarbital sodium and injected the mixture in 25 patients with epilepsy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain was then performed to determine intracerebral distribution of the amobarbital sodium. Results of SPECT were compared with those of conventional and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The distribution of Tc-99m HMPAO and, presumably, amobarbital sodium varied from patient to patient. SPECT revealed a statistically different distribution from that predicted with conventional angiography. The distribution also often differed from that of DSA, although the difference was not significant. SPECT revealed infrequent delivery to mesial temporal lobe structures. This emphasizes the need for caution in the use of the intracarotid amobarbital sodium test to predict the outcome of removal of these areas. 
4	Geriatric endocarditis: avoiding the trend toward mismanagement. The average age of patients with endocarditis is increasing. It is becoming a disease of the elderly, especially related to use of prosthetic heart valves and IV lines or catheters associated with bacteremias. Recognition is the major problem in the elderly patient since many features of the disorder are often attributed to aging. The diagnosis should be considered in the elderly patient with fever or other unexplained findings. Blood cultures are indicated to prevent misdiagnosis. 
2	Determination of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum using the polymerase chain reaction: clinical significance and correlation with serological and biochemical markers. Sera from 98 patients with various stages of chronic hepatitis B virus infection were studied to determine the clinical significance of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum detected by the polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into three groups according to their HBsAg and HBeAg status. Group I (n = 31) had detectable HBsAg and HBeAg, group II (n = 46) had HBsAg but not HBeAg and group III (n = 21) consisted of patients who were once chronic hepatitis B virus carriers but had lost HBsAg during follow-up. Group I patients usually had significant liver disease (raised serum aminotransferases), had higher titers of HBsAg and had been infected with hepatitis B virus for a shorter period than patients in the other two groups. All patients in group I had hepatitis B virus DNA detectable by polymerase chain reaction and 94% had sufficient hepatitis B virus DNA present for detection by dot-blot hybridization. Group II patients had lower mean serum aminotransferase activities and titers of HBsAg than those in group I. Serum hepatitis B virus DNA was detectable by polymerase chain reaction in 78% but in only 30% of group II patients by dot-blot hybridization. Group II patients who did not have hepatitis B virus DNA detectable by polymerase chain reaction had mean serum aminotransferase levels within the normal range and had a younger mean age than those with hepatitis B virus DNA. Group III patients generally had no evidence of active liver disease. 
2	Mucosal intussusception to avoid ascending cholangitis. Many methods have been devised to prevent ascending cholangitis following Kasai's hepatic portoenterostomy for biliary atresia. To investigate the effectiveness of mucosal intussusception in preventing ascending cholangitis, 20 mongrel dogs were randomized to undergo Roux-en-Y cholecystjejunostomy and common bile duct ligation with or without mucosal intussusception. Aeromonas hydrophila was instilled into the gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial cultures were grown from samples taken from the gallbladders and lower jejunum, and blood chemistry and barium studies were performed. The barium studies showed satisfactory lack of reflux in all ten dogs with mucosal intussusception. Only two of them had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder 3 days after bacterial instillation into the jejunum. All ten dogs in the control group had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder. Our results showed that the mucosal intussusception group had a significantly lower rate of recovery of organisms from the gallbladder compared with the control group when the organisms were instilled into distal intestine (P less than 0.05). The method is worthy of clinical trial as a means of preventing or treating ascending cholangitis. 
4	Effect of atenolol and diltiazem on heart period variability in normal persons. Several time and frequency domain measures of heart period variability are reduced 1 to 2 weeks after myocardial infarction, and a reduced standard deviation of normal RR intervals over a 24 h period (SDNN) is associated with increased mortality. The predictive accuracy of heart period variability may be reduced by drugs used to treat patients after myocardial infarction. Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers. During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001). The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%. Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h. Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability. The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers. 
5	Disruption of the human SCL locus by "illegitimate" V-(D)-J recombinase activity. A fusion complementary DNA in the T cell line HSB-2 elucidates a provocative mechanism for the disruption of the putative hematopoietic transcription factor SCL. The fusion cDNA results from an interstitial deletion between a previously unknown locus, SIL (SCL interrupting locus), and the 5' untranslated region of SCL. Similar to 1;14 translocations, this deletion disrupts the SCL 5' regulatory region. This event is probably mediated by V-(D)-J recombinase activity, although neither locus is an immunoglobulin or a T cell receptor. Two other T cell lines, CEM and RPMI 8402, have essentially identical deletions. Thus, in lymphocytes, growth-affecting genes other than immune receptors risk rearrangements. 
5	Treatable abdominal pathologic conditions and unsuspected malignant neoplasms at autopsy in veterans who received mechanical ventilation. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine, in medical patients who received mechanical ventilation, the frequency and types of major unexpected diagnoses at autopsy that, if known before death, would probably have led to improved survival (class I errors) or substantively changed management but not survival (class IIB errors). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six medical intensive care units in a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-two autopsied patients of the 401 veterans who received mechanical ventilation and died in the hospital. RESULTS: The class I error rate was 12%. Abdominal pathologic conditions--abscesses, bowel perforations, or infarction--were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain, results of examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued. Six percent of patients had extensive malignant neoplasms (class IIB errors). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentation of potentially treatable abdominal pathologic conditions is a common cause of class I errors in veterans who receive mechanical ventilation. Conversely, several patients with unrecognized terminal conditions underwent intensive intervention. If the information gained at autopsy had been known before death, management would have probably changed substantively in 18% of patients. 
4	Round fingerpad sign: an early sign of scleroderma. We describe a clinical skin sign in scleroderma termed round fingerpad sign. This term refers to disappearance of the peaked contour on fingerpads and replacement with a hemisphere-like fingertip contour; this change is especially apparent on the ring fingers. A positive round fingerpad sign was found in 72 of 72 ring fingers in 36 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis in 69 of 72 ring fingers in patients with mixed connective tissue disease, and in 24 of 24 ring fingers of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly. In contrast, a negative round fingerpad sign was seen in 240 of 240 fingers in normal women (controls). The high sensitivity of this sign is noteworthy. A positive round fingerpad was seen in sign not only typical scleroderma patients but also in groups with less severe skin sclerosis (i.e., in those patients with mixed connective tissue disease or those with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly). The sign is a new and useful clinical marker for the early diagnosis of scleroderma.
