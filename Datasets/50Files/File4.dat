1	Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in a 41-year-old man with XXY karyotype and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: report of a case. We report a case of adenocarcinoma of the prostate in a 41-year-old man with 47XXY karyotype (Klinefelter's syndrome) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The increased incidence of malignancy in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome has been well documented for certain neoplasms. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate has not been reported previously in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome and a 47XXY karyotype. Absence of mosaicism was confirmed by peripheral lymphocyte, skin fibroblast, bone marrow cell and spleen stroma fibroblast cultures. Chronic lymphocyte leukemia, especially the T-cell cytotoxic/suppressive variant, may additionally add to an immunological deficit. Since carcinoma of the prostate, Klinefelter's syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are common, the lack of a previous report is interesting. Etiological aspects are discussed. 
5	Tissue expansion in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The authors report their experience using skin expanders in 11 patients with severe bed sores. The expanders, with different volumes, from 250 to 1000 cc, were generally overfilled using the cutaneous tonometer. In fact, with the information revealed by this apparatus on the skin in expansion, the authors were able to reduce the filling intervals without risking ulceration. In their experience, the results obtained were satisfactory: All patients treated achieved surgical recovery. The authors see a wide future for skin-expander use in pressure-ulcer treatment. They have a working hypothesis about using expanders to progressively advance sensitive skin in areas subject to ulceration. This hypothesis is based on the possibility of reexpanding the same flap several times, as has been seen in the treatment of other types of pathology. 
4	Effects of intravenous verapamil on left ventricular relaxation and filling in stable angina pectoris. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function is often impaired in coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess whether verapamil could improve LV diastolic properties, 12 patients with CAD undergoing right- and left-sided cardiac catheterization, as well as simultaneous radionuclide angiography, were studied before and during intravenous administration of verapamil (0.1 mg/kg as a bolus followed by 0.007 mg/kg/min). The heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing in both studies. LV pressure-volume relations were obtained. Verapamil decreased LV systolic pressure (130 +/- 22 to 117 +/- 16 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and the end-systolic pressure/volume ratio (2.4 +/- 1.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.05), and increased LV end-diastolic (13 +/- 4 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) and pulmonary capillary pressures (10 +/- 5 to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.005). Despite such negative inotropic effects, cardiac index increased (3.4 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.02). The time constant of isovolumic relaxation shortened (63 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.02); peak filling rate increased (370 +/- 155 to 519 +/- 184 ml/s, p less than 0.001; 2.6 +/- 1.1 to 3.3 +/- 0.9 end-diastolic counts/s, p less than 0.02; and 4.1 +/- 1.6 to 5.5 +/- 1.5 stroke counts/s, p less than 0.001). 
3	Gene mapping and other tools for discovery. Genetic mapping provides a means of understanding the molecular basis of inherited diseases whose biochemistry is unknown. Adequate pedigrees, informative genetic markers, and accurate identification of the disease phenotype are necessary. For dominant inheritance, mapping studies can be done in a single large pedigree; the larger the number of affected individuals sampled the better the estimate of recombination between the gene causing the disease and one or more nearby genetic markers. For recessive inheritance, nuclear families with more than one affected sibling provide the best information. The development of many polymorphic DNA markers on the human genome has contributed to the success of mapping unknown genes because, as the genome is now densely covered with markers, the probability is good that at least one marker will be linked to the disease locus in a family that is segregating a disease allele. Most genetic markers now in use depend upon restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), which are either the result of single-base-pair substitution or the presence of a variable number of tandemly repeated oligonucleotide units at a locus (VNTRs). RFLPs can be recognized by digesting DNA with restriction enzymes and separating the fragments by size on an electrophoretic gel. VNTRs can vary widely among individuals, and they provide more linkage information than single-site polymorphic markers because family members are more likely to be heterozygous. Genetic maps of each chromosome, constructed from linkage data relating marker loci to one another in normal reference families, permit rational choices of markers for disease-mapping studies. 
5	Reduction of postoperative morbidity following patient-controlled morphine The present study examined the impact of two methods of pain management on recovery in 38 women undergoing hysterectomy. One group received IV morphine in the recovery room and IM morphine on the ward on a PRN basis (PRN group). In the other group, a loading dose of morphine 8 mg IV was given when the patient first complained of pain and patient-controlled IV morphine (PCA) was initiated and continued for 48 h (PCA group). Both groups received similar amounts of morphine overall, differently distributed over time. The PCA patients received 8 mg.h-1 in the recovery room (approximately 2.5 hrs) and less thereafter. The PRN patients received approximately 2 mg.h-1 for the entire 48-hr period. Pain control was better throughout convalescence and less variable across time with PCA management. Minute ventilation also recovered faster and by day four was 25 per cent above the preoperative baseline in the PCA group. In addition, oral temperature became normal one day earlier, ambulation recovered more rapidly and patients were discharged from hospital earlier. The data suggest that early treatment with relatively high, self-titrated morphine doses may alter the course of the metabolic response to surgery. 
5	Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease. We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease. Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease. 
1	Characterization in vitro of a human tumor necrosis factor-binding protein. A soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammatory responses. A cysteine-rich, highly glycosylated 30-kD TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) purified from urine may have a role in regulation because it protects in vitro against the biological effects of TNF. The cytotoxic effect of TNF on the fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 was inhibited by 50% at a 10-fold excess of TNF-BP. The binding of TNF to the receptor was partially reversed after the addition of TNF-BP. Results from biosynthetic labeling of cells with 35S-cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF-BP indicated that TNF-BP is formed and released at the cell surface by cleavage because no corresponding cellular polypeptide was observed. A cellular 60-kD polypeptide, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-BP, may correspond to the transmembrane TNF-receptor molecule and be the precursor of TNF-BP. Thus, TNF-BP appears to be a soluble form of a transmembrane TNF-receptor. Moreover our results demonstrate that the production of TNF-BP is increased when the TNF receptor is downregulated in cells by treatment with TNF or by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters. TNF-BP may be an important agent that blocks harmful effects of TNF, and, therefore, useful in clinical applications. 
1	Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21. Human breast cancer is usually caused by genetic alterations of somatic cells of the breast, but occasionally, susceptibility to the disease is inherited. Mapping the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer may also allow the identification of early lesions that are critical for the development of breast cancer in the general population. Chromosome 17q21 appears to be the locale of a gene for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer in families with early-onset disease. Genetic analysis yields a lod score (logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage) of 5.98 for linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to D17S74 in early-onset families and negative lod scores in families with late-onset disease. Likelihood ratios in favor of linkage heterogeneity among families ranged between 2000:1 and greater than 10(6):1 on the basis of multipoint analysis of four loci in the region. 
5	Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma. The percentage of necrosis in a primary osteosarcoma after the patient has received preoperative chemotherapy is prognostic and is usually used to select subsequent chemotherapy. However, the percentage of necrosis that occurs spontaneously, without preoperative chemotherapy, has not been adequately studied. The examination of histologic macrosections of 76 osteosarcomas from patients who had not received preoperative treatment and of 20 patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy revealed a significant difference in the percentage of necrosis. There was minimal spontaneous necrosis, but necrosis after preoperative chemotherapy was usually extensive. The larger the tumor, the greater the percentage of spontaneous necrosis; however, size did not correlate with the percentage of necrosis with preoperative chemotherapy. Survival among those patients who did not receive preoperative treatment correlated with the size and percentage of necrosis. Necrosis in an osteosarcoma in a patient who has received preoperative chemotherapy can be considered the result of chemotherapy and not a spontaneous event. 
3	Presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis of myotonic muscular dystrophy with linked DNA probes. Advances in neurogenetics are facilitating clinical care. Localization of the mutant gene that causes myotonic muscular dystrophy (DM) to chromosome 19 enabled our predictive testing using linked DNA probes in 74 members of 12 families at risk. Individuals sought either diagnostic confirmation or exclusion with childbearing in mind, or requested prenatal diagnosis. Valuable information was provided for 11 of 12 families. Of 14 individuals at 50% risk, 12 learned they did not have DM, two learned they did (although presymptomatic), and prenatal diagnoses of affected fetuses were made in three families--all with high degrees of certainty. The future opportunity for prenatal diagnosis was provided for 3 other families. The potential health risks to an affected female and her affected or nonaffected fetus provide cogent reasons for physicians to inform DM families in their care about these important advances and opportunities to avert grave complications. 
5	Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review. The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years. Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy. Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time. 
2	Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation. In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team. There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction. Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients. Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions. Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively). The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities. 
5	Cerebral falciparum malaria mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We have described a patient with cerebral falciparum malaria who had rapidly progressive CNS deterioration, renal failure, hemolytic anemia associated with striking and varied erythrocyte morphologic changes, and thrombocytopenia. The initial diagnosis was thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) of unknown origin. Reexamination of the peripheral smear of this comatose patient led to correct diagnosis and effective treatment in this case of cerebral falciparum malaria--another of medicine's great mimickers. 
2	Gallstone pancreatitis. Choosing and timing treatment. Patients with gallstone pancreatitis are often seen initially by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality. Initial management should include supportive medical care and surgical consultation. The timing of surgery is then dictated by serum enzyme levels and liver function test results as well as by the patient's condition. The role of endoscopic intervention is currently evolving. Whether surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy is preferable as primary therapy for gallstone pancreatitis remains unresolved. However, sphincterotomy with stone extraction is a viable option in selected cases, especially in patients who have severe gallstone pancreatitis. 
4	Obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and response to antihypertensive drugs. Responsiveness to antihypertensive medications was investigated cross-sectionally in 559 individuals comprising all treated hypertensive patients identified within a representative sample (n = 3,532, aged 40-70 years) of the Jewish population in Israel. A rate of dosage score (a summed ranking of dosages of all drugs taken) of two or more increased significantly with increasing levels of body mass index (BMI) from 37.5% in levels less than 23, 54.9% in levels 23.0-29.9, and 76.4% in levels of 30 or greater (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, gender, arm circumference, and ethnic group, confirmed the independent effect of BMI on dosage score (p less than 0.001). At each level of dosage score, mean blood pressure levels were equivalent at all levels of BMI after adjusting for potential confounders. This indicates that achieved blood pressure level and not BMI itself was the main determinant of the higher dosing regimens prescribed at higher levels of BMI. In representative subgroups, glucose tolerance (n = 372) and hyperinsulinemia (n = 190) were determined and were found to be positively associated with a dosage score of two or more (p less than 0.05) independently of BMI. These effects could not be accounted for by poor compliance or by altered drug absorption or disposition since overnight urinary drug excretion and plasma drug concentrations 2 hours after ingestion, measured in 80 randomly selected patients from the study group, were not different across BMI categories at similar dosages. 
5	Thoracoplasty: current application to the infected pleural space Thoracoplasty, once commonly used in the management of cavitary pulmonary disease, continues to find application in the obliteration of infected pleural spaces. This study reports a series of 13 patients receiving thoracoplasty between 1976 and 1989. Five patients had chronic apical empyema spaces without prior resection of lung tissue. Two of the empyemas were due to tuberculosis, two were due to atypical mycobacteria, and one was due to postpneumonic empyema. All patients had extensive destruction of upper lobe tissue. Eight patients had undergone prior pulmonary resection; 3 had persistent infected spaces in the early postoperative period, 3 had development of empyemas and bronchopleural fistulas late (5 to 19 years) after pulmonary resection, and 2 had postpneumonectomy empyema. All patients had rigid cavity walls preventing space obliteration by rib removal alone and required concomitant resection of the thickened pleura and intercostal muscle tissues. Bronchopleural fistulas were present in 11 patients and were closed with adjacent nonintercostal muscle. All patients survived and had successful obliteration of the infected spaces with acceptable physiological and cosmetic results. We conclude that thoracoplasty remains a useful procedure in the management of the infected pleural space in select patients. 
4	Dynamic association between artery shear flow condition and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in human hypertension. 1. Blood cells and vascular endothelial cells are subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically generated shear stress forces. In vitro, membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation. 2. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients. 3. Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter, and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1. Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator. The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma. 4. Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02), shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy. In contrast, neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, in vitro per se. 5. In the overall population, strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001), but also between their absolute values, suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport. 
2	Oxygen free radicals in acute pancreatitis of the rat. This study aimed to assess the role of oxygen free radicals in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by infusion of the CCK-analogue cerulein (5 micrograms/kg per hour) for 30 minutes, 3.5 hours, and 12 hours. After the infusion, serum enzymes and conjugated tissue dienes and malondialdehyde were measured and tissue samples were subjected to electron and light microscopy. Electron microscopy after 30 minutes showed moderate intracellular alterations. After 3.5 hours of cerulein infusion interstitial oedema and intravascular margination of granulocytes in the pancreatic gland were seen. After 12 hours histological evaluation showed pronounced zymogen degranulation, extensive tissue necrosis, and migration of granulocytes into the tissue. Amylase and lipase activities increased 15 and 35-fold respectively during this time. After 30 minutes of cerulein infusion conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde increased, they reached their peak after 3.5 hours and decreased to normal values after 12 hours. Treatment with superoxide dismutase (100,000 U/kg/hour) and catalase (400,000 U/kg/hour) either before or after the start of the cerulein infusion prevented lipid peroxidation and reduced zymogen degranulation and tissue necrosis. Tissue oedema and inflammatory response, however, were not affected in any of the treated rats. Oxygen free radicals are instrumental in the development of acute pancreatitis. Even after its onset, scavenger treatment reduced the tissue damage normally observed. 
5	Remodeling of the rat right and left ventricles in experimental hypertension. Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in renovascular hypertension is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the extracellular space and around intramyocardial coronary arteries. Even though the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was previously found to attenuate this interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, the relative importance of arterial and ventricular systolic pressures versus circulating angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (AL) in promoting hypertrophy and collagen accumulation in renovascular hypertension is uncertain. By drawing on the in-parallel arrangement of the right and left ventricles, with respect to their coronary circulation, and the in-series mechanical alignment of the ventricles, with a pressure-overloaded left and a normotensive right ventricle, this study sought to address this uncertainty. Three models of experimental hypertension, each having a different circulating AII and AL profile, were examined and compared with their controls: renovascular hypertension, where both AII and AL are increased; infrarenal aorta banding, where AII and AL are normal; and a chronic infusion of AL, where AII is suppressed or normal and AL is increased. In renovascular hypertension, as well as with AL, we found a significant rise in the interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area of the pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. This remodeling was not seen in either ventricle with infrarenal aorta banding despite comparable systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, in experimental arterial hypertension in the rat, myocyte and nonmyocyte compartments of the myocardium are under separate controls: myocyte hypertrophy is most closely related to ventricular loading while circulating AII and AL, acting alone or in concert with other humoral factors, regulate the accumulation of collagen within the right and left ventricles. 
2	Anorectal dysfunction in patients with urologic disturbance due to multiple sclerosis. Anorectal function was evaluated in 11 patients with voiding dysfunction due to multiple sclerosis. In six patients with constipation, three also had symptoms of obstructed defecation and one patient was incontinent due to stercoral diarrhea. One patient was only fecal incontinent and one patient had obstructed defecation as the only symptom. Three patients had no anorectal symptoms. Anal manometry in the women compared with a control group revealed significant lower anal resting and squeeze pressures, although no significant difference of rectal sensation to distention with air was found. Pudendal nerve terminal latencies were obtained in seven patients and were all normal. In four patients latency could not be demonstrated due to poor contraction of the sphincter on stimulation of the pudendal nerve. Two of these patients were incontinent and two had both constipation and obstructed defecation. It is concluded that patients with voiding symptoms due to multiple sclerosis often reveal anorectal symptoms or motility disorders. Although anal sphincter function is reduced, fecal incontinence is not prevalent in this group. The reason for this lies probably in the fact that many of the patients are constipated, thus securing fecal continence. 
5	Idiopathic and symptomatic trigeminal pain. The trigeminal reflexes (corneal reflex, blink reflex, masseter inhibitory periods, jaw-jerk) and far field scalp potentials (nerve, root, brainstem, subcortical) evoked by percutaneous infraorbital stimulation were recorded in 30 patients with "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia (ITN) and 20 with "symptomatic" trigeminal pain (STP): seven postherpetic neuralgia, five multiple sclerosis, four tumour, two vascular malformation, one Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and one traumatic fracture. All the patients with STP and two of those with ITN had trigeminal reflex abnormalities; 80% of patients with STP and 30% of those with ITN had evoked potential abnormalities. The results indicate that 1) trigeminal reflexes and evoked potentials are both useful in the examination of patients with trigeminal pain, and in cases secondary to specific pathologies provide 100% sensitivity; 2) in "symptomatic" and "idiopathic" paroxysmal pain the primary lesion affects the afferent fibres in the proximal portion of the root or the intrinsic portion in the pons; 3) primary sensory neurons of the A-beta fibre group are involved in both paroxysmal and constant pain, but in the latter the damage is far more severe. 
5	Follow-up of patients who underwent arterial switch repair for transposition of the great arteries Thirty infants underwent arterial switch for transposition of the great arteries within the first week of life (mean age, 2.8 days). An additional three patients underwent repair at 5 1/2, 8, and 9 1/2 months of age. Six (18.2%) of 33 patients died. All the survivors were not receiving cardiac medications or diuretics at the time of the last follow-up visit. Examination of 24 of 27 survivors at 1 to 5 years of age revealed normal growth in 75% of the patients. Two patients had height, weight, and head circumference below the fifth percentile for age. Four patients had height and weight appropriate for age but head circumference below the fifth percentile. Neurodevelopmental testing yielded normal findings in 18 patients. Three patients were considered suspect and an additional three were abnormal neurodevelopmentally. Head circumference less than the fifth percentile, abnormalities on computed tomographic scans of the brain, and emergency balloon atrial septostomy or emergency switch operation were more likely to occur in patients who had low neurodevelopmental scores. We conclude that the majority of patients who undergo arterial switch repair demonstrate normal growth and development and no impairment of cardiovascular function. However, significant morbidity in the form of neurodevelopmental problems may occur. 
5	Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Optimal treatment for unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas remains controversial. This study was done to examine the relationship between perioperative jaundice and postoperative morbidity, and type of palliative biliary bypass and postoperative morbidity and jaundice clearance. Seventy-six patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas were studied. Forty-nine patients underwent one of four different types of palliative bypass: 1, cholecystojejunostomy (n = 22); 2, choledochojejunostomy (n = 11); 3, choledochoduodenostomy (n = 9), and 4, cholecystoduodenostomy (n = 7). Age, sex and preoperative health status were similar for all operative groups, as well as for those with and without postoperative morbidity. The postoperative complication rate was 33 per cent and there was one postoperative death. Length of preoperative jaundice and peak preoperative bilirubin levels were independent of morbidity. Postoperative morbidity was similar for each type of bypass used and no significant difference was found when cholecystoenteric (1 and 4) and choledochoenteric (2 and 3) bypass were compared. The results of this study support the view that postoperative morbidity is not directly related to the presence of jaundice preoperatively. Furthermore, the rate of jaundice clearance and the occurrence of postoperative complications are not dependent on the type of bypass used. 
5	Nonsurgical management of breast infections in nonlactating women. A word of caution. Management options for infectious mastitis have traditionally been limited to surgical drainage. With the advent of percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA), nonoperative treatment may be an alternative, though criteria for use have not been defined. During a 30-month period, 22 women presented with breast infection. Treatment was instituted based upon the clinical stage of infection. Patients with cellulitis (n = 8) were managed with diagnostic FNA/antibiotics. Those with focal abscess (n = 10) underwent FNA of the cavity/antibiotics. Patients with multiloculated abscess (n C = 3) underwent urgent surgical drainage. Of the 19 patients initially treated nonoperatively, resolution occurred in nine (47%); stage of infection did not effect outcome. Surgical drainage was required in the remainder; two cancers were found. FNA cytology in these (and all) patients was negative for malignancy. All underwent mammography during treatment. In 17 (77%) cancer was considered of low probability. The only patient with a mammogram highly suspicious for cancer had fat necrosis on biopsy. Bacterial cultures were positive in 79 per cent, virtually all with Gram (+) cocci. Four patients harbored Gram (-) organisms as well, two in concert with breast cancer. Conclusions: 1) select breast infections can be successfully managed nonoperatively, 2) the accuracy of FNA and mammography in the diagnosis of breast cancer may be impaired by coincident infection, 3) the finding of a Gram (-) breast infection warrants abandonment of nonoperative management in favor of tissue confirmation of the disease process. 
3	An evaluation of a 30-gauge needle for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. A 30-gauge spinal needle was evaluated for Caesarean section, using a combined epidural/spinal technique, in 50 mothers. Spinal anaesthesia failed in six mothers and was inadequate in another six. General anaesthesia was required on one occasion. A 25% overall failure rate suggests that a 30-gauge needle is not a practical proposition for routine clinical practice. 
4	Effect of delayed captopril therapy on left ventricular mass and myonecrosis during acute coxsackievirus murine myocarditis. The effect of captopril on coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Thirty-two, 3-week-old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0 of the study, then randomized into a placebo group or a captopril group starting on day 3 of infection. On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052). We conclude that captopril is beneficial in decreasing left ventricular mass and the amount of myocardial necrosis and calcification in the short term in the murine myocarditis model. 
4	Renal manifestations of NaCl sensitivity in borderline hypertensive rats. Compared with the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibits exaggerated alterations in renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory function during volume expansion (exaggerated natriuresis) and environmental stress (antinatriuresis). The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat and develops hypertension with increased dietary NaCl intake. The present investigation sought to determine whether the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress. Borderline hypertensive rats fed a 1% NaCl diet remained normotensive and exhibited renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress that were similar to those of their Wistar-Kyoto parent. Borderline hypertensive rats fed an 8% NaCl diet developed hypertension and exhibited responses that were similar to those of their spontaneously hypertensive parent. Thus, the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress. The results suggest that increased dietary NaCl intake is able to induce or unmask the capabilities for these responses, which are genetically conveyed to the borderline hypertensive rat by the spontaneously hypertensive rat parent in latent forms. 
4	The use of PTFE graft to correct anomalous drainage of persistent left superior vena cava. A new technique to correct persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC) drainage into the left atrium is described in a 14-year-old patient with situs inversus, left atrial isomerism common atrium, and mitral valve regurgitation. During surgery, occlusion of the LSVC markedly increased the venous pressure, precluding its ligation. Because of the malposition of the heart and the unusual atrial anatomy, correction with an intra-atrial baffle was not attempted. After correcting the intra-cardiac anomaly, the LSVC was divided and anastomosed to the "right" atrial appendage using a segment of PTFE graft. The postoperative course was uneventful and an angiogram demonstrated excellent performance of the graft. 
5	Efficacy and safety of intravenous nicardipine in the control of postoperative hypertension. IV Nicardipine Study Group. In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) nicardipine was compared with placebo in the control of postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. One hundred twenty-two patients (17 cardiac and 105 noncardiac surgery) met the entry criteria (systolic BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) and were randomized (3:2) to receive IV nicardipine (n = 71) or placebo (n = 51). Therapeutic response (greater than or equal to 15 percent reduction in BP from baseline) was achieved in 94 percent of patients treated with IV nicardipine vs 12 percent with placebo (p less than 0.001). The mean response time and infusion rate for IV nicardipine were 11.5 (+/- 0.8) minutes and 12.8 (+/- 0.3) mg/h, respectively. The magnitude of BP reduction was similar in both cardiac and noncardiac postsurgical patients. Blood pressure control was sustained with minimal dose adjustments of IV nicardipine (3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/h) during a prolonged maintenance infusion period of 6.8 +/- 0.5 h. A reflex mean increase in heart rate of 5 bpm was seen in patients treated with IV nicardipine. Sixteen patients (15 noncardiac and one cardiac surgery) had a sustained heart rate of greater than 100 bpm, with a mean increase of 24 bpm from the baseline. In all these patients except three, tachycardia was resolved while receiving nicardipine. None of these patients who had development of tachycardia during nicardipine therapy had exhibited ST segment changes indicative of ischemia. One patient with tachycardia at baseline had exhibited ST segment depression (3 to 4 mm) during nicardipine treatment, which was resolved following discontinuation of nicardipine therapy and application of nitroglycerin (Nitropaste). Hemodynamic evaluation revealed that IV nicardipine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and significantly increased cardiac index with no change in heart rate. These hemodynamic changes were similar in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. Adverse experiences reported with IV nicardipine included hypotension (4.5 percent), tachycardia (2.7 percent), and nausea/vomiting (4.5 percent). In the placebo group, the incidence of adverse experience was 6 percent, with an equal distribution of hypotension (2 percent), nausea/vomiting (2 percent), and headache (2 percent). No clinically important changes in laboratory variables related to IV nicardipine were reported. In conclusion, these findings indicate that nicardipine, a titratable intravenous calcium channel blocker, can rapidly and effectively control postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. 
3	Speech, velopharyngeal function, and hearing before and after orthognathic surgery. Articulation, voice, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were examined in 34 patients before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after orthognathic surgery. Thirty of the 34 patients had articulation errors before surgery. Errors on the sibilants /s/ and /z/ occurred most frequently, followed by those on /j,zh,ch/ and /sh/. Errors were predominantly distortions with both visual and acoustic components. After surgery, articulation improved spontaneously in the absence of intervention. Most of the preoperative articulation errors were eliminated by 3 months postoperative, but, thereafter, a gradual decline was noted so that by 12 months, errors occurred on /s/ and /z/. Voice, resonance, velopharyngeal port area, and hearing sensitivity were not altered by surgery. This study suggests that severe skeletal malocclusions requiring surgical correction have deleterious effects on the patients' articulation of consonants and that surgical alteration leads to the correction of most of these errors. 
5	Doppler assessment of pulmonary artery pressure and extrapulmonary shunting in the acute phase of hyaline membrane disease. The natural history of pulmonary artery pressure and extrapulmonary shunting in acute hyaline membrane disease was studied by serial Doppler echocardiography in 57 preterm infants, 38 with, and 19 without, hyaline membrane disease. Pulmonary artery pressure was assessed non-invasively by its inverse relationship with the ratio of pulmonary artery Doppler time to peak velocity: right ventricular ejection time. The mean ratio was significantly lower in the infants with hyaline membrane disease. The mean ratio for each infant with hyaline membrane disease varied widely and did not correlate with criteria of maturity or severity of disease. Individual ratios correlated with arterial pH. Between 60-80 hours after birth, 14 of 18 infants with hyaline membrane disease (78%) and one of 19 without (5%) had patent ductus arteriosus. Left to right and bidirectional shunting at ductal and atrial level were common; pure right to left shunting was uncommon. The mean ratio seen with bidirectional shunting was significantly lower than that seen with left to right shunting. Ratios and patterns of extra pulmonary shunting were similar when the fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) was greater than 0.9 compared with when it was less than 0.9. Pulmonary artery pressure is high during the acute phase of hyaline membrane disease but varies widely among infants. A few infants have extrapulmonary right to left shunting, and these infants are difficult to detect clinically. 
2	An epidemic outbreak of cryptosporidiosis: a prospective community study from Guinea Bissau. In the first year of a prospective community study of childhood diarrhea conducted in a semiurban area in the capital of Guinea Bissau, Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 73 (6.0%) of 1216 episodes of diarrhea. The parasite was the second most prevalent intestinal parasite, and the only one significantly associated with diarrhea (OR = 2.79, P = 0.0006). The seasonal distribution was striking, with a peak prevalence in the beginning of the rainy season (May 17.6%) when an epidemic outbreak of diarrhea started. The prevalence was highest in children younger than 18 months, an age at which prevalences of other intestinal parasites were low. This reverse age pattern may possibly be explained by the small infective dose needed to create severe infections, by air-borne transmission and by the development of protective immunity. 
4	Dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging: a new marker of triple-vessel disease. To investigate the significance and mechanism of dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging, we performed both dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging and dipyridamole radionuclide angiography on 83 patients with known angiograms. The dipyridamole/delayed ratio of the left ventricular dimension from the thallium-201 image was defined as the left ventricular dilatation ratio (LVDR). An LVDR greater than the mean + two standard deviations in patients without coronary artery disease was defined as abnormal. Twenty-two of 83 patients showed an abnormal LVDR, and 18 of the 22 patients (82%) had triple-vessel disease. By defect and washout analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying the patients as having triple-vessel disease was 72% and 76%, respectively, whereas LVDR had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 93%. When LVDR was used in combination with the defect and washout criteria, sensitivity increased to 84% without a loss of specificity. In those 22 patients with abnormal LVDRs, end-diastolic volume measured by radionuclide angiography did not change after dipyridamole infusion. Dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging reflected relative subendocardial hypoperfusion induced by dipyridamole rather than actual chamber enlargement. The LVDR was moderately sensitive and highly specific for triple-vessel disease and provided complementary information to dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging. 
5	Synthesis of 70K stress protein by human leukocytes: effect of exercise in the heat. To determine whether reinduction of 70,000-Da (70K) stress protein synthesis could be used as an assay for thermal history and/or cellular levels of 70K stress protein in hyperthermic humans, leukocytes were obtained before and after 2 h of exercise and then incubated at 37 or 41 degrees C. Five healthy males completed 2 h of treadmill exercise consisting of running at 4-6 km/h for 30-45 min followed by 75-90 min of walking up a 2-10% grade. This exercise bout was performed by two subjects in hot (46 degrees C, 15% relative humidity) and by five subjects in cooler (30 degrees C, 40% relative humidity) environmental conditions. Exercise resulting in rectal temperature (Tre) less than 40 degrees C did not alter the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C. In contrast, exercise resulting in Tre greater than 40 degrees C reduced the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C. A protein immunoblot, probed with an antibody specific for the inducible 72K stress protein, showed that the reduction of 35S-labeled 70K stress protein in these postexercise leukocyte samples occurred without marked elevations of this protein. In vitro incubation of human leukocytes at 40 degrees C for 15-120 min reduced, in a time-dependent manner, the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized during a subsequent 41 degrees C heat stress. This reduction of 70K stress protein synthesis in 41 degrees C-treated leukocytes was abolished when cycloheximide was present during the 40 degrees C preincubation. 
5	Mechanisms of edema formation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The contribution of inflammatory cells. Most of the central nervous system (CNS) endothelium regulates the passage of solutes and functions as a blood-brain barrier (BBB). During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, loss of BBB function occurs. The authors have previously shown an increase in endothelial transcytotic activity associated with decreased mitochondrial content as evidence of BBB dysfunction in EAE. These changes occurred in the capillary bed and correlated with CNS edema and clinical signs. In the present report, a fixation procedure before infusion of the intravascular tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in rats at the height of clinical EAE has been used. In these animals, tracer leakage was only noted in inflamed venules with diameters of 12 to 19 mu. The authors detected several mechanisms of passive leakage: 1) increased junctional permeability; 2) increased interendothelial space; 3) leakage alongside migrating inflammatory cells. Some small capillaries showed necrotic changes with minimal tracer leakage. This report demonstrates that BBB disruption also occurs via nonendocytic mechanisms that may be induced by inflammatory cells. 
4	Percutaneous popliteal approach for angioplasty of superficial femoral artery occlusions. Angioplasty using the percutaneous popliteal approach was utilized in 50 patients (PTS) to recanalize 59 occluded superficial femoral arteries which had been unsuccessfully canalized by using the antegrade approach because of either a flush origin occlusion or inability to maintain the guide wire in the true lumen. All PTS had claudication; 8 had rest pain; 3 had non-healing ulcers. The laser Probe was used in 17 cases and the Rotablator in 3 cases. Occlusion length varied between 1 and 40 cm: 7 lesions were less than 10 cm (group 1); 9 were between 10 and 20 cm (group 2); and 43 were greater than 20 cm (group 3). An angiographic success was obtained in 48/59 lesions (81%): 14/16 (87%) in groups 1 and 2 and 34/43 (79%) in group 3. Three PTS needed complementary common femoral endarterectomy and one required percutaneous aspiration of a thromboembolus. Complications included: arterial perforation and/or dissection (without clinical sequelae) in 11 and a popliteal hematoma in 1 PT. One patient with a severely ischemic leg underwent successful emergency vascular surgery, while another limb salvage patient required below-knee amputation. There was no worsening of limb ischemia from any popliteal approach attempt. At discharge, 39 patients (78%) whose outcome would have been unsuccessful with the traditional antegrade approach were clinically improved after utilizing the popliteal approach to achieve a successful angioplasty procedure. 
1	A population-based study of functional status and social support networks of elderly patients newly diagnosed with cancer. We assessed the functional status and social support networks of 799 men and women aged 65 years or older newly diagnosed with cancer and living in six New Mexico counties. Functional limitations included depending on others for transportation (33%) and mental incompetence or poor recent memory (42%). The percentage of patients with functional limitation increased sharply with increasing age. In a substantial number of patients there was also evidence for poor social support networks; 26.5% of subjects lived alone and 38.9% had no children living in the vicinity. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of having a poor social support network included non-Hispanic white ethnicity, advanced age, low income, and being a recent migrant to the area. Subjects with functional limitations were more likely to have poor social support networks than subjects without such limitations. The deleterious combination of impaired functional status and a limited social support network may explain why elderly cancer patients are at increased risk for not receiving appropriate therapy. Given the potential complexities involving the evaluation and appropriate treatment of cancer, care must be taken to adequately assess functional status and support mechanisms of older patients, and to provide adequate support to ensure compliance with treatment. 
5	Late results with Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprosthesis. From 1977 to 1984, 429 patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR), and 339 underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR) with a Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthesis. Early mortality for AVR was 4.6% (isolated AVR, 1.9%) and for MVR was 5.3% (isolated MVR, 4.1%). Follow-up was 99.3% complete at a mean of 5.9 years. Actuarial event-free rates at 10 years for AVR and MVR were, respectively, 1) for structural valve deterioration, 91.4 +/- 3.2% versus 75.1 +/- 4.0% (p less than 0.01); 2) for nonstructural dysfunction, 100% versus 97.8 +/- 1.6% (p = NS); 3) for thromboembolism, 90.6 +/- 2.3% versus 87.3 +/- 2.6% (p = NS); 4) for anticoagulant-related bleeding, 95.3 +/- 1.1% versus 88.6 +/- 2.4% (p = 0.05); 5) for endocarditis, 87.8 +/- 5.7% versus 90.6 +/- 2.4% (p = NS); 6) for reoperation, 91.0 +/- 2.5% versus 74.4 +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.01); 7) for valve-related mortality, 76.1 +/- 6.9% versus 71.4 +/- 5.2% (p = 0.01); 8) for permanent physical impairment, 85.0 +/- 3.0% versus 71.5 +/- 3.6% (p less than 0.01); and 9) for combined operative mortality, valve-related mortality, and reoperation, 68.7 +/- 6.4% versus 51.5 +/- 4.9% (p = 0.01). No structural valve dysfunction was observed in any AVR patient whose valve was inserted after age 70. Age at operation was the only factor that predicted structural valve deterioration (p less than 0.01). 
5	Steroid hormone abnormalities in women with severe idiopathic constipation. Patients with severe idiopathic constipation are almost exclusively women of reproductive age. To investigate the possibility of a sex hormone abnormality in this condition, we have compared a range of sex hormones during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in 23 healthy women (mean age 33 years) with those in 26 patients with severe idiopathic constipation (mean age 32 years, spontaneous bowel frequency less than one per week). In the patients there was a reduction in the follicular phase of progesterone (4.5 v 4 nmol/l, p = 0.006, median value, controls v patients), 17 hydroxyprogesterone (9.7 v 5.8 nmol/l, p = 0.01), cortisol (387 v 245 nmol/l, p = 0.008), testosterone (2.3 v 1.8 nmol/l, p less than 0.001), androstenedione (10.3 v 8.4 nmol/l, p = 0.02), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (5.1 v 3.0 mumol/l, p = 0.03). In the luteal phase there was a reduction of oestradiol (483 v 350 pmol/l, p = 0.015), cortisol (322 v 242 nmol/l, p = 0.047), and testosterone (2.4 v 1.7 nmol/l, p = 0.003). The concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin, prolactin, luteinising hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone were not significantly different in either phase of the cycle. Women with severe idiopathic constipation have a consistent reduction in steroid hormones. 
2	Hepatitis B vaccination and interleukin 2 receptor expression in chronic renal failure. Only 50 to 60% of dialysis patients develop anti-HBs antibodies following hepatitis B vaccination. The nonresponder state correlates with impaired monocyte function, decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) production of T cells, and an upregulation of the IL-2 receptor system. In the present study we examined anti-HBs production after hepatitis B vaccination and the in vitro expression of IL-2 receptors in nondialyzed patients with various degrees of chronic renal failure. Forty-four patients with impaired renal function were immunized with 2 micrograms recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and boostered after one and six months. Prior to the first injection IL-2 receptor expression of activated T cells was studied by an in vitro proliferation assay. Sixty-four healthy subjects served as controls. After completion of the third vaccination 55.0% of the patients acquired antibody titers greater than 10 U/liter. The seroconversion rate did not differ between patients with lower (less than 3.5 mg/dl) and higher (greater than 3.5 mg/dl) creatinine levels. In nonresponders IL-2 receptor expression (stimulation index, SI = 10.09 +/- 1.80) was elevated compared to healthy controls (SI = 4.62 +/- 0.35, P less than 0.002) or patients who responded with a high antibody titer (greater than 50 U/liter, SI = 3.12 +/- 0.43, P less than 0.001). Patients who produced low antibody titers (less than 50 U/liter) also presented with enhanced IL-2 receptor expression. These data show that an impaired antibody production following hepatitis B vaccination and an enhanced IL-2 receptor expression of T cells may already be present in early stages of chronic renal failure. 
5	Pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: atypical presentations. Severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and markedly elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase developed in a 29-year-old-woman in whom one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine death. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy developed with good fetal outcome in the next pregnancy. This case suggests that pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are part of a clinical spectrum. Moreover, classic abnormalities of liver function tests need not be present in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
1	Are three substages of clinical B prostate carcinoma useful in predicting disease-free survival? The B1 nodule, a 1.5 cm area of induration surrounded on at least two sides by prostatic tissue of normal consistency, was defined by Jewett in 1968 as the stage of prostatic cancer best suited for treatment and cure by radical prostatectomy (RP). The area of prostatic induration suitable for RP was subsequently extended to less than one lobe (Stage B1); this extension of induration was supported by the study of Walsh and Jewett in 1980 showing a 51 percent survival free-of-disease at fifteen-year follow-up. Subsequently, clinical staging systems evolved which substaged clinical B into three categories of induration: B1N = less than 1.5 cm nodule, B1 = greater than 1.5 cm but less than one lobe, and B2 = one lobe or both lobes. To determine if digital assessment of these progressively greater degrees of induration would translate into different intervals to first progression, whether local or distant, we reviewed prostate diagrams and descriptions of all Stage B patients treated by Iodine-125 interstitial implant and external beam radiation therapy between 1974 and 1985 at our institution. Forty-six patients had B1 nodules, 78 patients B1 (less than one lobe), and 52 patients B2 (one lobe or greater). Mean follow-up was fifty-five months. We found B1N, which was also associated with well-differentiated grade and a normal acid phosphatase, to have the longest interval to progression. 
4	A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. 
2	Abdominal wall pain: an alternative diagnosis. The cause of abdominal pain need not necessarily reside in the viscera; the abdominal wall is another source of symptoms. Some causes of abdominal wall pain are obvious, e.g. hernias, but not so others such as nerve entrapment syndromes. This review is concerned with causes of abdominal wall pain which, although common, may be easily overlooked. 
5	Interferon alfa therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Effects on hepatitis B virus DNA in the liver. Pretrial and posttrial liver biopsy samples from 124 adult patients who participated in two randomized, controlled trials of interferon alfa therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were analyzed to determine the effects of interferon on the replication of HBV in the liver. Replicative forms of HBV DNA were detected in the pretrial biopsy samples from all and posttrial biopsy samples from 74% treated patients and 86% controls. Replicative forms of HBV DNA were detected in the posttrial biopsy samples from all patients who remained positive for hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in the serum, in 77% treated patients and 80% controls who cleared HBV DNA in the serum but who remained positive for hepatitis B e antigen, but in only 19% treated patients and 40% controls who cleared HBV DNA as well as hepatitis B e antigen in the serum. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly lower in patients whose posttrial biopsies did not contain replicative forms of HBV DNA. In summary, we demonstrated that in most patients with chronic HBV infection treated with interferon alfa, serological response was associated with the disappearance of replicative forms of HBV DNA in the liver. 
5	Intravenous but not intracolonic epidermal growth factor maintains colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned rat colorectum. The role of epidermal growth factor in the proliferation of normal and premalignant colonocytes in vivo is not fully understood. In particular, the relative importance of its possible systemic and intraluminal routes of action has not been fully clarified. Rats with surgically defunctioned distal colorectums were used, and mini osmotic pumps were implanted to study the effects of intraluminal and IV administration of epidermal growth factor on colonocyte proliferation. Within 2 weeks of bypass, colonocyte proliferation in defunctioned colorectum has decreased to about one third the rate in normal colorectum or in colorectum proximal to the defunctioning colostomy. Intraluminal epidermal growth factor, infused from the time of operation did not reverse this hypoplasia, whereas IV epidermal growth factor maintained colonocyte proliferation at approximately the normal rate in bypassed colorectum. This model is suitable for testing other putative colonic mitogens for possible intraluminal and systemic effects. 
5	Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion in the United Kingdom: survey of clinical practice. Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and tend to recur after simple aspiration. Pleurodesis may prevent recurrence of the effusion; many agents and techniques have been described. A questionnaire was sent to 448 clinicians in the United Kingdom to determine how pleurodesis is performed in practice. There was a 56% overall response, with replies from 101 respiratory physicians, 88 general physicians, 29 thoracic surgeons, and 35 general surgeons. General surgeons saw few cases of malignant pleural effusion and rarely performed pleurodesis. A patient with recurrent malignant pleural effusion would usually be managed with pleurodesis by 76 (76%) respiratory physicians, 26 (30%) general physicians, and 23 (81%) thoracic surgeons; a further 29 (33%) general physicians would refer such patients to another specialist. Most medical pleurodesis were performed by junior staff, whereas consultant thoracic surgeons were more likely to be concerned with the procedure. All the thoracic surgeons used an intercostal tube drain, usually with suction. An intercostal tube drain was used routinely by only 54 (54%) of the respiratory physicians and 28 (32%) general physicians. Thoracic surgeons preferred talc for pleurodesis whereas physicians most commonly used tetracycline. The variety of methods in use supports the need for randomised, controlled studies to determine the most effective technique of pleurodesis. 
1	Substance-P is present in a subset of thyrotrophs in the human pituitary. Substance-P immunoreactivity and tachykinin-like peptides are present in the pituitary gland of several mammalian species. In humans, however, the biochemical nature and cellular localization of pituitary substance-P has not been defined. We report here that substance-P-immunoreactive material is present in low concentrations in both the anterior and posterior lobes of the human pituitary gland. Gel chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography indicate that the majority of the substance-P immunoreactivity in human pituitaries elutes as authentic substance-P and its oxidized derivative. Immunohistochemical studies showed substance-P-immunoreactive fibers and terminals in the posterior pituitary gland and occasional substance-P-immunoreactive cell bodies in the anterior lobe. The substance-P-immunoreactive cells were found to colocalize with a small subpopulation of TSH beta-immunoreactive cells (thyrotrophs). Substance-P immunoreactivity was also found in a pituitary microadenoma that contained numerous TSH beta-immunoreactive cells. These studies indicate that substance-P is present in the human pituitary gland, and they suggest a relationship between substance-P and thyroid function. 
4	Noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography. A completely noninvasive method for estimating left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation has been devised with the use of continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and brachial sphygmomanometry. Of 46 patients studied with mitral regurgitation, 35 (76%) had jets with distinct Doppler spectral envelopes recorded. The peak ventriculoatrial gradient was obtained by measuring peak mitral regurgitant velocity in systole and using the modified Bernoulli equation. This gradient was then subtracted from peak brachial systolic blood pressure, an estimate of left ventricular systolic pressure, to yield left atrial pressure (left atrial pressure = systolic blood pressure - mitral regurgitant pressure gradient). Noninvasive estimates of left atrial pressure from 35 patients were plotted against simultaneous recordings of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure resulting in the correlation y = 0.88x + 3.3, r = 0.88, standard error of estimate = +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Therefore, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and sphygmomanometry may be used in selected patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation for noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure. 
1	Breast cancer screening: who should be included? The recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are reviewed in regard to screening for breast cancer. In contradistinction to those issued by some other national organizations, screening for breast cancer using mammography at ages 40-49 is not recommended. It is concluded that the scientific evidence is insufficient at present to recommend mammography screening for women aged 40-49. The recommendations of the task force are: all women over age 40 should receive an annual breast examination; all women should have mammography every one or two years beginning at age 50 and concluding at approximately age 75 unless disease has been detected; and it may be prudent to begin mammography at an earlier age for women at high risk of breast cancer. These recommendations are appropriate in light of the available evidence; though at present there is no evidence that clinical examination of the breasts at any age reduces breast cancer mortality; the upper age beyond which breast cancer screening no longer has a significant effect in reducing breast cancer mortality is unknown; and there is no evidence that women at high risk for breast cancer benefit to a different degree from screening than women not at high risk. 
5	Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. A new neurocutaneous syndrome with normal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. A number of inherited disorders of cornification have been related to abnormal lipid metabolism. In the recessively inherited Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, defined by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spasticity, fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency has recently been reported. These patients accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. We postulate that this patient has a novel neurocutaneous syndrome that may be secondary to abnormal lipid metabolism. 
2	Clinical experience with biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Biliary lithotripsy is a new and important development in the nonsurgical management of gallbladder, cystic duct, and bile duct stones. Most patients do not require general or epidural anesthesia with newer second-generation machines. Patient selection and the use of adjuvant therapy to aid fragment clearance are important issues that are discussed. Results from different centers are compared but few long-term results are yet available, i.e., longer than 18 months. 
5	Internal mammary artery and saphenous vein graft patency. Effects of aspirin. As part of two Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Trials, we obtained angiographic patency data for internal mammary artery (IMA) and saphenous vein grafts to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery at 1 year after coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients received either aspirin 325 mg q.d., aspirin 325 mg t.i.d., aspirin 325 mg and dipyridamole 75 mg t.i.d., or placebo. Aspirin was initiated either 12 hours before or 6 hours after operation. Patients were stratified preoperatively for extent of disease and randomized to the therapies outlined above. There was no randomization to IMA versus saphenous vein grafts to the LAD. When the patients taking placebo were compared with those taking aspirin, there were no differences in the IMA (100.0% versus 92.1%, p = 0.385) or vein graft (88.8% versus 90.4%, p = 0.675) patency rates. The patency rate, irrespective of treatment, for all IMA grafts was 92.8% (220 of 237) versus 90.1% (345 of 383) for all vein grafts to the LAD (p = 0.309). Thus, both the IMA and vein grafts had excellent patency rates at 1 year. Aspirin did not alter this at 1 year, and there were no differences between IMA and vein graft patency to the LAD. 
4	Death at cardiac catheterization: coronary artery embolization of calcium debris from Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthesis. The case described is a death due to embolization of calcium debris from a bioprosthesis, dislodged at cardiac catheterization. As more bioprosthetic valves are implanted, and more of them fail long-term with calcification, such complications of the invasive study of these valves may be expected. 
1	Insulinomas: localization with selective intraarterial injection of calcium. To facilitate the noninvasive preoperative localization of islet cell tumors less than 15 mm in diameter, the authors examined the use of calcium as an insulin secretagogue in an arterial stimulation venous sampling (ASVS) technique. In four patients with episodic hypoglycemia, calcium gluconate (0.01-0.025 mEq Ca2+/kg) was injected directly into branches of the celiac plexus (gastroduodenal, splenic, and hepatic arteries) and the superior mesenteric artery. In all patients, serum levels of insulin rose abruptly in blood samples taken from the right hepatic vein 30 and 60 seconds after the infusion of calcium into the artery supplying the tumor; injection into an artery not supplying the tumor did not result in a similar rise. Accurate localization of the insulinomas was verified at surgery in three patients. In the fourth patient, who did not undergo surgery, arteriographic results were positive for insulinoma at the predicted site. On the basis of these results, the authors believe noninvasive ASVS may replace invasive portal venous sampling as the most effective method for the localization of occult insulinomas. 
3	EEG correlation of improvement in hemolytic-uremic syndrome after plasma infusion. We report a previously undescribed electroencephalographic pattern of epochs of diffuse delta background (85-240 sec) alternating with epochs of classic "burst suppression" (90-270 sec) in a 13-month-old girl with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. A dramatic electroencephalographic improvement was evident on continuous monitoring of cerebral function 3 hours after initiating fresh frozen plasma infusion, well before any clinical improvement was apparent. This patient, in addition to the unusual electroencephalographic findings, illustrates the role of continuous electrophysiologic monitoring of cerebral function and supports the use of fresh frozen plasma in hemolytic-uremic syndrome. 
5	Cluster headache: the effect of low oxygen saturation The present study concerns the possible relationship between hypoxia and the generation of cluster headache attacks. Fifteen controls and 25 cluster headache patients were studied. The patients were allocated into two groups according to cluster headache stage, i.e. cluster or remission period. During the tests, all the subjects were asked to inhale 12% oxygen (88% N2) for 30 min, and the decreasing oxygen saturation (SaO2%) was monitored. Patients in the remission period showed nearly the same decrement of SaO2% as controls. At the end of the test, patients in the bout showed significantly less reduction of SaO2% than the controls. In 5 patients, the test was carried out both in and outside the cluster periods. The tendency to less decrement in oxygen saturation in the cluster phase was as marked with this comparison, but the difference between the groups was not significant, probably partly due to the low number of tests carried out. Only one patient got a typical attack. It seems that hypoxia of this magnitude per se is not the cause of attacks. The different pattern with respect to SaO2% following 12% O2 inhalation in cluster headache may be due to an abnormality in central regulation and/or chemoreceptor sensitivity. 
5	Quality-of-life-adjusted evaluation of adjuvant therapies for operable breast cancer. The International Breast Cancer Study Group OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a single cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with longer duration chemotherapy for premenopausal women or chemoendocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer using a quality-of-life-oriented end point, Q-TWiST (quality-adjusted analysis of TWiST: Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity). DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial--International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG: formerly Ludwig Group) Trial V. SETTING: IBCSG participating centers in Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, Yugoslavia, Spain, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and South Africa. PATIENTS: Data were available for 1229 eligible patients with node-positive breast cancer who were randomized to receive one of three adjuvant treatments after at least a total mastectomy and axillary clearance. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either a single cycle of perioperative chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and leucovorin; or six cycles (6 months) of a conventionally timed chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone for premenopausal women or this combination plus tamoxifen for postmenopausal women; or both perioperative and conventionally timed chemotherapy for a 7-month course of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: At 5 years of median follow-up, patients who received the longer duration therapies had an improved 5-year disease-free survival percentage (53% compared with 36%; P less than 0.001) and 5-year overall survival percentage (73% compared with 63%; P = 0.001) compared with those who received the single perioperative cycle alone. By 3.5 years, the greater burden of toxic effects associated with the longer duration treatments was balanced by their superior control of disease. Within 5 years of follow-up, even after subtracting time with adjuvant treatment toxicity, patients gained an average of 2.2 months of Q-TWiST if treated with the longer duration therapies compared with the single cycle (P = 0.03). The gain for premenopausal patients was 2.8 months (P = 0.05), whereas the gain for postmenopausal women was 1.5 months (P greater than 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Six or seven months of adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoendocrine therapy improve both the quantity and quality of life for patients with node-positive breast cancer compared with a single short course of perioperative combination chemotherapy. 
4	Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):862-70] Serum levels of DHEA sulfate are inversely associated with cardiovascular death in men, and urinary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels are inversely associated with clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. These observations may be related to the antiproliferative effects of DHEA, resulting in inhibition of atherosclerotic intimal hyperplasia. To examine the relation between these steroids and a direct measure of coronary atherosclerosis, plasma DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels were determined in 206 middle-aged patients (103 men, 103 women) undergoing elective coronary angiography. Plasma DHEA sulfate levels were lower in men with at least one stenosis greater than or equal to 50% compared with those without any stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (4.9 +/- 2.7 versus 6.1 +/- 3.5 nmol/ml, p = 0.05). Levels of DHEA sulfate were also inversely related to the number of diseased coronary vessels (r = -0.20, p = 0.05) and a continuous measure of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (r = -0.25, p = 0.01) in men. The association between DHEA sulfate levels and extent of coronary artery disease was independent of age and other conventional risk factors for coronary disease. In women, there was no association between plasma DHEA or DHEA sulfate levels and coronary disease. These data demonstrate a consistent, independent, inverse, dose-response relation between plasma DHEA sulfate levels and angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis in men. Plasma DHEA sulfate may be another important and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. 
1	Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome. We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage. Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia. None had hemimegalencephaly. We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients. 
5	Catecholaminergic systems in the medulla oblongata in parkinsonian syndromes: a quantitative immunohistochemical study in Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and striatonigral degeneration. We investigated tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the medulla oblongata corresponding to the A1 and A2 cell groups in autopsy tissue of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 3), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 3), striatonigral degeneration (SND) (n = 2), and in controls (n = 4). The estimated total number of TH-positive neurons in the A1 and the A2 regions was normal in PD and PSP patients. The sparing of medullary catecholaminergic cells in PD and PSP may be related to their minor degree of melanization and the possibility that intermediate compounds associated with the oxidative catabolism of norepinephrine and epinephrine may be less cytotoxic than those generated by degradation of dopamine. Patients with SND showed a marked loss of TH-immunoreactive cells in the A1 and the A2 groups, which may contribute to the impairment of vasomotor control characteristic of the disease. 
1	Percutaneous urinary diversion in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Twenty-two patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer underwent percutaneous urinary diversion; at the time, all but one had metastatic disease. Eleven patients received postnephrostomy therapy. The median survival time for all the patients was one hundred nineteen days. Overall, 41 percent of the patients' remaining lifetime was spent in the hospital. Six never left the hospital and 10 required rehospitalization; the remaining 6 patients were never rehospitalized. The median survival time for this group of patients was shorter than the expected survival of similar patients without ureteral obstruction. It appears that percutaneous urinary diversion does not improve the quality of life of these patients. 
4	Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography: a statement by a task force committee of the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, controlled, prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve, it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase. 
5	Hemorrhoids. A practical approach to an aggravating problem. Although hemorrhoids are considered a minor medical problem, they may cause considerable discomfort and anxiety. Fortunately, treatment is often simple and surgery is rarely necessary. In this practical article, Dr Cocchiara describes internal and external hemorrhoids, a classification system, and treatment choices based on the degree of involvement. 
4	Clinical and hemodynamic correlates of sympathetic nerve activity in normal humans and patients with heart failure: evidence from direct microneurographic recordings. To characterize the neural excitatory state of heart failure, simultaneous measurements of efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (by microneurography) and rest hemodynamics were obtained in 10 normal subjects (age 25 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SEM) and 29 patients with heart failure (age 49 +/- 2 years; New York Heart Association functional class II to IV; left ventricular ejection fraction 21 +/- 1%; cardiac index = 2.16 +/- 0.13 liters/min per m2; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 23 +/- 2 mm Hg). Sympathetic nerve activity was significantly higher in the patients with heart failure (54.7 +/- 4.5 bursts/min) than in normal subjects (16.7 +/- 2.2 bursts/min, p less than 0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that sympathetic activity in these human subjects was most strongly and inversely correlated with left ventricular stroke work index (r = -0.86, p less than 0.0001) and stroke volume index (r = -0.85, p less than 0.0001). There was a strong positive correlation between sympathetic nerve activity and pulmonary artery diastolic (r = 0.82, p less than 0.0001) and mean (r = 0.81, p less than 0.0001) pressures. Similar correlations were seen when patients with heart failure were analyzed separately. There was no significant correlation between sympathetic nerve activity and mean arterial pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction (by radionuclide ventriculography), cardiac chamber size (by echocardiography) or arterial oxygen tension in the patients with heart failure. Direct measurements of sympathetic nerve activity correlated closely with plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001) in patients with heart failure. Thus, sympathetic nerve activity at rest parallels impairment of cardiac performance in patients with heart failure. 
3	Obstructive sleep apnoea in children undergoing routine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Sleep screening was used to discover the incidence of sleep apnoea in 50 children undergoing routine adenotonsillectomy for recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, randomly selected from the waiting list. Preoperative assessment included a detailed parental history, physical examination, and lateral cephalometry, in order to identify factors that might alert the clinician to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea. There were 2 equal groups of snorers and non-snorers (grade 0); 1 patient was found to have the sleep apnoea syndrome (IV), 9 patients had obstructive snoring with apnoeic episodes (III), 3 patients had snoring with a disrupted sleep pattern (II), and 12 patients snored with no disruption of sleep (I). In identifying patients with apnoea, a history of snoring was unhelpful, whereas one of breathing irregularities was found to be highly specific. Nasal obstruction correlated poorly; however, there was a significant relationship between tonsillar position and size and sleep grade (Chi-squared P less than 0.01). Stepwise regression analysis showed a large contribution to the grading was made by the size of the oropharyngeal airway measured by lateral cephalometry. The children in grade II-IV were re-studied 3 months post-operatively and all reverted to grades 0 or I. 
3	Fulminating multiple sclerosis-like leukoencephalopathy revealing human immunodeficiency virus infection. A 66-year-old French homosexual man and a 42-year-old Brazilian man with no known risk factors for HIV infection developed headaches, asthenia, and neurologic episodes of abrupt onset. CT showed multiple hypodense, nonenhancing lesions. Serology for HIV was positive. They died respectively 2 months and 1 month after onset of the illnesses. Autopsy in both cases showed multiple, well-demarcated, demyelinating foci in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum with histologic features characteristic of recent plaques of multiple sclerosis. There were no multinucleated giant cells or microglial nodules. Immunostaining for HIV was negative. Although a random coincidence of MS and HIV infection cannot be ruled out, the close temporal relationship between the 2 disorders suggests a possible etiologic association. 
5	Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. To determine the clinical outcome of patients requiring emergency repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, we reviewed 23 such procedures performed for ongoing myocardial ischemia refractory to medical management. The operative mortality was 17%. On follow-up, an average of 24.9 months after emergency reoperation, 14 of the 19 survivors (74%) had recurrent angina. As compared to a randomly selected group of 25 patients who underwent elective repeat CABG procedures during the same time period, the incidence of late cardiac events was significantly higher (79% in the emergency group, 30% in the elective surgery group) and fewer patients had received internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts (9% vs 52%). Emergency repeat CABG operations have considerable operative mortality and poor postoperative functional results with the majority of survivors developing recurrent ischemic syndromes within a short period of time. 
3	Cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To investigate the influence of central cholinergic deficit on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the neuropsychological performance of a group of 20 patients who were treated with anticholinergic drugs (mean daily dose, 10.2 mg) with that of a group of 20 patients who received no anticholinergics. The two groups were matched for all the variables of parkinsonism and levodopa therapy. At the dose used, there was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for intellectual, visuospatial, instrumental, and memory function. In contrast, in the group that received anticholinergics severe impairment was observed on tests believed to assess frontal lobe function. These results suggest that the lesion of the ascending cholinergic neurons, which has been demonstrated post mortem in PD, may play a role in the subcorticofrontal behavioral impairment of this disease. 
5	Orbital inflammatory disease associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Orbital inflammatory disease in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is rare and presents a diagnostic dilemma as well as a therapeutic challenge. Ours appears to be the sixth such case reported in the literature. 
1	Differential effects of the stimulation of complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) on cell proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. The regulatory role of CR1 and CR2 on B cell activation and proliferation has been investigated by using B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells are clonal expansions of B lymphocytes frozen at specific stages of activation. They displayed two patterns of response upon surface Ig (sIg) cross-linking in terms of in vitro proliferation and intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization: cells from patient F (first pattern) proliferated in the presence of mitogenic anti-mu antibodies, whereas cells from patient A (second pattern) did not respond to sIg cross-linking but proliferated in the presence of low m.w. B cell growth factor and IL-2. Coculture of A or F cells with C3b-bearing SRBC led to a two- to four-fold increase in thymidine incorporation in cultures containing low m.w. B cell growth factor but not in cultures containing rIL-2. This enhanced proliferation was inhibited by F(ab')2 polyclonal rabbit antihuman CR1 antibodies. Only cells which proliferated in the presence of anti-mu (cells F) responded to cross-linking of sIg with a rise in intracellular Ca2+. No increase in calcium mobilization was observed after co-cross-linking of CR1 and sIg on A and F cells with mAb or polyclonal anti-CR1 antibodies. Co-cross-linking of CR2 with sIg only led to an enhanced intracellular Ca2+ rise in F cells but not in A cells. The lack of CR2-mediated synergy in Ca2+ rise in A cells indicates that the synergy occurs only if there is a proper coupling of sIg to phospholipase C. CR1-induced proliferation of B cells does not involve the signaling pathways of sIg. These results provide additional evidences for the role of C3 fragments in modulation of human B cell activation. 
2	Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy: an overview. Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) was reintroduced 12 years ago. Since that time, over 400 patients have undergone PPPD with approximately 41 per cent having chronic pancreatitis and 54 per cent having pancreatic and other periampullary malignancies. Reported 5-year survivals in this latter group have been comparable to those achieved by the classic Whipple procedure. The postoperative mortality rate in 339 reported patients has been 3.8 per cent. Postoperative morbidity, including delayed gastric emptying, has been similar to that of the classic Whipple operation. However, PPPD has been associated with fewer late problems with dumping, diarrhoea, delayed gastric emptying (8.6 per cent), and marginal ulceration (3.6 per cent). Moreover, most patients undergoing PPPD have been able to return to their preoperative and preillness weight. The additional advantage of decreased operative time makes PPPD an attractive alternative to the classic pancreatoduodenectomy. 
4	Gastric outlet obstruction caused by traumatic pseudoaneurysm of superior mesenteric artery. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are extremely rare. We describe two cases of posttraumatic proximal SMA pseudoaneurysms with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Repair was accomplished by aorta-SMA bypass with saphenous vein. Injuries to the proximal SMA are easily missed at laparotomy, especially if intestinal ischemia or hematomas are absent. Recognition and repair are stressed to avoid the complications associated with pseudoaneurysm formation. 
4	Acute hemodynamic effects of captopril in children with a congestive or restrictive cardiomyopathy The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children (age, 0.3-18 years) with cardiomyopathy. Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy, whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg). Blood pressures were measured in the aorta, pulmonary artery, right atrium, and pulmonary capillary wedge position; cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique. Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate, severe hypotensive response. In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac index increased by 22%, from 2.3 to 2.8 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and stroke volume increased by 22%, from 23 to 28 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 units.m2 (p less than 0.01), but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly. In contrast, four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril, but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension (mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg). Thus, captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy. In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy, however, captopril did not affect cardiac output, but it did decrease aortic pressure. These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease. 
1	Basal cell carcinoma arising in pemphigus vulgaris of the lower eyelid. A 59-year-old woman on continuous treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for pemphigus vulgaris of 14 year's duration presented with an enlarging nodular lesion on the right lower eyelid. The neoplasm, diagnosed as basal cell carcinoma, was excised conserving the lid margin, and eyelid reconstruction was done with a rotated cheek flap. Wound healing proceeded without complications in spite of immunosuppressive treatment, and the final cosmetic and functional result was satisfactory. 
3	Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. 
4	Determinants of carotid intima-media thickness: a population-based ultrasonography study in eastern Finnish men. We investigated the determinants of maximal intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries in a population-based sample of 1224 Eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54 or 60 years. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic examination was performed as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD). The maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) varied between 0.48 mm and 4.09 mm (mean value +/- SD, 0.94 mm +/- 0.38 mm). Age (standardized partial coefficient, beta = 0.238, P less than 0.0001), ambulatory pulse pressure (beta = 0.130, P less than 0.0001), cigarette-years of smoking (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), serum LDL cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), history of ischaemic heart disease (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.070, P = 0.0113) and diabetes (beta = 0.068, P = 0.0072) were most strongly associated with IMT. This study confirms the role of systolic blood pressure, smoking and serum LDL cholesterol levels as major risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness. 
4	The normal mediastinum in blunt traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta and brachiocephalic arteries. In a review of 52 articles, published between 1953 and 1989, 656 patients with blunt traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta or brachiocephalic arteries were identified. Of these, 608 (92.7%) had an abnormal mediastinum on initial chest radiographs obtained in the emergency department, thus allowing early detection of the vascular injury. Unfortunately, 48 (7.3%) of these patients had a normal mediastinum on their initial chest radiographs. This appears to occur when the traumatic pseudoaneurysm is not accompanied by associated mediastinal hemorrhage or hematoma formation, and the pseudoaneurysm is either small or is situated in such a way that it does not alter the mediastinal contour. The use of accessory clinical and radiographic signs to indicate the need for aortography has been shown to be of very low yield, but would have allowed the early detection of an additional 5.6% of the reported cases. Performing aortography solely on the basis of a history of major decelerating blunt trauma to the thorax remains the only way, in the acute emergency department setting, to detect the 1.7% of patients with aortic or brachiocephalic arterial rupture who have no mediastinal abnormality or accessory clinical or radiographic signs of vascular injury. There is evidence from the literature, however, to suggest that the evaluation of serial chest radiographs obtained at close intervals for the first month following trauma for the development of mediastinal abnormality or large hemothorax is an acceptable alternative to the routine performance of aortography in those blunt chest trauma victims with no clinical or radiographic suspicion of vascular injury. 
5	Antithrombotic efficacy of continuous extradural analgesia after knee replacement. We have studied the effect of extradural analgesia on postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Forty-eight patients were allocated randomly to receive either general anaesthesia or extradural analgesia with local anaesthetics for 3 days. All patients wore compressive elastic stockings and no anticoagulant drugs were administered. Bilateral venography was performed 10 days after surgery. Continuous extradural analgesia did not impede mobilization of the patients. One case of nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in a patient who received general anaesthesia. The use of continuous extradural analgesia resulted in a significant difference in the total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (18% compared with 59% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.02]. The incidence of calf vein thrombosis was 12% compared with 45% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.05). 
1	In vitro and in vivo consequences of VLA-2 expression on rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Cloned integrin alpha 2 subunit complementary DNA was expressed on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to give a functional VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1) adhesion receptor. The VLA-2-positive RDA2 cells not only showed increased adhesion to collagen and laminin in vitro, but also formed substantially more metastatic tumor colonies in nude mice after either intravenous or subcutaneous injection. These results show that a specific adhesion receptor (VLA-2) can markedly enhance both experimental and spontaneous metastasis. In contrast to the metastasis results, there was no difference in either the in vitro growth rate or apparent in vivo tumorigenicity of RD and RDA2 cells. 
1	Palliative operations for colorectal cancer. A review of 96 consecutive patients who underwent palliative surgery for primary colorectal cancer was undertaken to clarify the value of palliation achieved with surgical treatment. The overall rate of postoperative mortality was 8 percent (8 of 96) and the overall rate of postoperative morbidity was 24 percent (23 of 96). The mortality rate was 5 percent (3 of 66) after resective surgery and 17 percent (5 of 30) after nonresective surgery. Three deaths were related to the malignant disease, three were related to the intra-abdominal infection, and two were related to formation of intestinocutaneous fistulas. Of the 8 patients who died, 1 had a tumor with local visceral involvement only and 7 had a tumor with more distant spread. Median survival was 10 months for all patients, 15 months for patients treated with resective surgery, and 7 months for nonresected patients. Five patients (5 percent) have survived for longer than 5 years. The median relief of preoperative cancer symptoms was 4 months (4 months after resective surgery and 1 month after nonresective surgery). Twenty-five patients have undergone second surgery. It is concluded that palliative resective surgery for colorectal cancer can improve patient comfort with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate when cancer growth is localized and in favorable cases with more distant spread, whereas nonresective surgery fails to achieve symptom relief. 
1	Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma of the tongue. A case of posterior tongue lymphoma associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) that occurred as a lesion in the lingual dorsal portion is reported in a 64-year-old woman. Initially, a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma was considered as no findings associated with ATL except lymphadenopathy and serum anti-ATLA antibodies were present. Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered with favorable results; however, 4 months later, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia developed, and 2 months later, generalized lymphadenopathy and hypercalcemia evolved. At this time, a diagnosis of ATL was made. The patient died of renal dysfunction 6 months after the initial presentation. In suspected cases of ATL and malignant diseases of T-cell lineage, namely, malignant lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, the presence of HTLV-1 infection should be confirmed by testing for anti-ATLA antibodies. 
4	Coronary balloon angioplasty through diagnostic 6 French catheters. We investigated the use of ultralow profile balloon catheters (Scimed ACE, USCI Probe, Cordis, Orion) for coronary angioplasty through 6 French diagnostic catheters (Schneider, Cordis). Contrast injection was assisted with a Hercules pump (Cordis) in all cases. During 21 procedures, angioplasty of 27 lesions in 20 selected patients was attempted (1.3 lesion/procedure). Twelve lesions were in the right, 10 in the left anterior descending, and 5 in the left circumflex coronary artery. Balloon size varied between 2.5 and 3.5 mm. Twenty lesions could be successfully dilated (74%) through the 6 French catheter and 7 lesions required an exchange to a 7 French angioplasty guiding catheter. For 5 cases, another balloon was also necessary to complete the procedure. The final overall success rate was 100% per patient and per lesion and there were no major complications. Despite the small internal catheter lumen (1.22 mm) coronary visualization was adequate, and mechanical support was good. Failures of 6 French catheters were attributed to insufficient torque control and excessive friction when the balloon crossed the tapered end of the diagnostic catheter. Coronary angioplasty through a diagnostic 6 French catheter is feasible and may represent a reasonable alternative for simple cases that are done during the same session as the diagnostic angiography. Once available, 6 French high flow angioplasty guiding catheters without a tapered tip should improve success while retaining the advantage of a small femoral puncture site. 
1	Biology of basal cell carcinoma (Part II). Host-tumor relationships involve several factors that can enhance or suppress neoplastic growth. This second part of a review of basal cell carcinoma biology examines the role that hormones, cytokines, local and systemic immunity, congenital and genetic syndromes, and environmental factors play in the development of this neoplasm. Theories of etiology and pathogenesis are discussed, and transplantation and cell culture techniques used to study this cancer are explored. Valuable second-line therapies for treatment of multiple tumors are reviewed, and important areas of present and future research are emphasized. 
1	Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer. The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y. During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed. Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake. A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8). The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake. Adjustment for different potential confounding factors did not alter the results. The present data suggest that breast cancer is associated inversely with energy intake and weakly positively with energy-adjusted fat intake. 
1	Bronchoalveolar carcinoma: factors affecting survival. One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients (65 men and 69 women) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Mean age was 65 years. Lobectomy was done in 100 patients, pneumonectomy in 10, segmentectomy in 5, and wedge excision in 19. Only 10 patients had lymph node metastases (7.5%). The neoplasm was solitary in 111 patients (82.8%); 97 were in stage I, 4 were in stage II, 9 were in stage IIIa, and 1 was in stage IIIb. There were two operative deaths (1.5%). Thirty-nine complications occurred in 31 patients. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Recurrent bronchoalveolar carcinoma developed in 45 patients. Five- and 10-year survival for patients in stage I was 75.2% and 62.0%, respectively. Survival for patients with T1 N0 M0 neoplasms was identical to expected survival and was 90.5% at 5 years, as compared with 55.4% for patients with T2 N0 M0 disease, only 35.9% for patients with multiple bilateral disease, and 0.0% for patients with bilateral disease (p less than 0.0001). Other significant factors adversely affecting survival included the presence of signs and symptoms, diffuse malignant invasion, mucin-producing tumors, and the histological absence of scar. We conclude that bronchoalveolar carcinoma has a unique natural history that is more influenced by local neoplastic processes than by lymph node metastases. Early aggressive pulmonary resection is safe and offers the potential for cure. The presence of bilateral cancer, however, is ominous. 
1	Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicating multiple myeloma. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicated the course of two patients with multiple myeloma. The diagnosis was established in both cases by bronchoalveolar lavage, which demonstrated the typical pneumocysts. Clinical and roentgenographic improvement in both patients was observed following a course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One patient had lymphocyte subsets performed with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.8; both patients were HIV antibody-negative by ELISA. Both patients tolerated prophylactic TMP-SMX given concurrently with the subsequent chemotherapy for myeloma. We suggest that the immune defect seen in multiple myeloma may have placed these patients at risk for opportunistic infections such as P carinii pneumonia; however, as opposed to patients with AIDS, our patients tolerated therapy with TMP-SMZ quite well. 
3	Induction, blockade and restoration of a persistent hypersensitive state. A new model of chronic hypersensitivity was developed in the rat by daily intraplantar administration of either prostaglandin E2 dopamine or isoprenaline, for a period of 2 weeks. Like other hyperalgesic mediators, dibutyryl-cAMP, when applied to the paws, caused an acute effect but did not produce persistent hypersensitivity. The persistent hypersensitive state was not affected by a typical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (indomethacin), was temporarily inhibited by a centrally acting analgesic (morphine), was partially inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) and abolished by a single dose of peripherally acting analgesics such as dipyrone or N-methyl morphine. Once the residual hypersensitivity had been abolished with dipyrone or N-methyl morphine, a small dose of prostaglandin E2, dopamine or Interleukin-1 beta, which in normal animals causes a mild and short lived effect, restored the persistent hypersensitive state. This ability to restore the persistent effect was not observed with intraplantar administration of dibutyryl-cAMP. Our results suggest the existence of a peripheral trace of inflammatory pain, a phenomenon which may be associated with stimulation of neuronal adenylate cyclase and protein synthesis. This concept may explain part of the puzzle of chronic inflammatory pain and lead to the development of new analgesics. 
4	Distinguishable types of dyspnea in patients with shortness of breath. Dyspnea frequently accompanies a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations. 
4	New operative method for distal aortopulmonary septal defect. A new technique is described for repairing distal aortopulmonary septal defect with aortic origin of the right pulmonary artery in a 26-day-old neonate. To prevent the narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery in the distal aortopulmonary septal defect caused by conventional intraluminal prosthetic patch reconstruction, rerouting of the right pulmonary artery using native aortic wall tissue without artificial material was performed. This method seems to be superior to the conventional method, especially during the neonatal period. 
1	When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis. Autonomic neural impulses that accompany discharges during a seizure can cause a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, anginal chest pain, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Either generalized or focal seizures may generate such signs and symptoms. A better appreciation of cardiac problems caused by epilepsy is helpful in preventing misdiagnosis, because the clinical picture in such a patient may be confusing. 
5	China White epidemic: an eastern United States emergency department experience. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to isolate significant clinical or demographic findings concerning overdose patients treated during a China White (3-methyl fentanyl) epidemic and compare them with data for all unintentional narcotic overdose patients during a 24-month period. DESIGN: We reviewed charts from 85,246 patient visits to our emergency department during the 24-month period of January 1987 through December 1988 to study this narcotic epidemic. Data from the Allegheny County Coroner's Office pertaining to unintentional drug overdose deaths that occurred during this same period also were reviewed. SETTING: The first outbreak of narcotic overdoses in the eastern United States involving China White occurred in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in 1988. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they met the criteria of a suspected unintentional narcotic overdose, but excluded if they were not given naloxone. INTERVENTIONS: Emergency physicians became suspicious of China White use after an unusual increase in narcotic overdoses presenting to the ED coupled with "routine drug of abuse" screens negative for opiates despite dramatic patient responses to naloxone. In most of the cases in which specific testing was done, there were positive indicators of fentanyl derivatives. Investigations found China White present in street drugs and paraphernalia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A cluster was defined as a time period with a statistically significant increase in overdoses over the expected number for an interval of equal length. Although there were no significant clinical differences in case presentation during the 24-month period, there was a statistically significant 13-fold increase in overdoses during the September through November 1988 cluster (mean, 13 vs 0.95 per month, P less than .001 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A dramatic increase in unintentional drug overdose deaths occurred in the county during this cluster. A total of 18 fentanyl-positive unintentional drug overdose deaths, predominantly male (89%) and black (56%), with an age range of 19 to 44 years (mean, 34.9 years), were reported by the county coroner (13 during the cluster). Narcotic overdoses and unintentional drug overdose deaths declined sharply with confiscation of a clandestine China White laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: China White was responsible for a dramatic rise in unintentional drug overdose deaths in Allegheny County in 1988. There were no significant clinical differences between China White overdose survivors and other unintentional narcotic overdose victims. Overdoses responsive to naloxone with inconsistent routine toxicologic screens may be due to a fentanyl analogue. 
2	Norwalk virus genome cloning and characterization. Major epidemic outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis result from infections with Norwalk or Norwalk-like viruses. Virus purified from stool specimens of volunteers experimentally infected with Norwalk virus was used to construct recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) and derive clones representing most of the viral genome. The specificity of the clones was shown by their hybridization with post- (but not pre-) infection stool samples from volunteers infected with Norwalk virus and with purified Norwalk virus. A correlation was observed between the appearance of hybridization signals in stool samples and clinical symptoms of acute gastroenteritis in volunteers. Hybridization assays between overlapping clones, restriction enzyme analyses, and partial nucleotide sequence information of the clones indicated that Norwalk virus contains a single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense, with a polyadenylated tail at the 3' end and a size of at least 7.5 kilobases. A consensus amino acid sequence motif typical of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases was identified in one of the Norwalk virus clones. The availability of Norwalk-specific cDNA and the new sequence information of the viral genome should permit the development of sensitive diagnostic assays and studies of the molecular biology of the virus. 
2	"Mini-perforation" of the colon--not all postpolypectomy perforations require laparotomy. In a 10-year experience with 4,784 consecutive colonoscopic polypectomies, the need for operative intervention in just two of seven perforations indicates that patients with specially defined, limited perforations can usually be treated nonoperatively. This specific complication, which has been termed "mini-perforation," is generally detected within 6-24 hours of polypectomy, and is characterized by local pain and tenderness, without signs of diffuse or spreading peritoneal irritation. Free intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal air on x-ray documents the actual perforation. Complete resolution of symptoms within 24-48 hours confirms the diagnosis of "mini-perforation." Success depends on good bowel preparation for colonoscopy, and early recognition of perforation, with institution of bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics. The "mini-perforation" spontaneously closes, probably by omental adherence. Frequent serial clinical examinations are mandatory so that frank perforation with advancing peritonitis will be promptly recognized and treated surgically. An understanding of the three levels of cautery injury to the colon wall--"serosal burn," "mini-perforation," and "frank perforation" are essential in managing the complications of colonoscopic polypectomy. 
4	Clinical results of femoropopliteal bypass using externally supported (EXS) Dacron grafts: with a comparison of above- and below-knee anastomosis. As of the end of September 1989, 52 EXS Dacron grafts had been implanted for femoropopliteal bypass operations. The distal ends of 27 grafts were anastomosed to above-knee popliteal arteries and those of 25 grafts to below-knee popliteal arteries. The cumulative patency rate of above-knee grafts was 71.3% at 54 months, and that of below-knee grafts was 78.8% at 48 months (n.s.). Kinking and stenosis of the arteriosclerotic proximal and/or mid popliteal artery when the knee was bent were angiographically remarkable. These changes may explain why some femoropopliteal grafts occlude with time and why the late results of above-knee grafts are not much better than those of below-knee grafts. 
5	High survival rate in advanced-stage B-cell lymphomas and leukemias without CNS involvement with a short intensive polychemotherapy: results from the French Pediatric Oncology Society of a randomized trial of 216 children. From April 1984 to December 1987, the French Pediatric Oncology Society (SFOP) organized a randomized trial for advanced-stage B-cell lymphoma without CNS involvement to study the possibility of reducing the length of treatment to 4 months. After receiving the same three intensive six-drug induction courses based on high-dose fractionated cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX), and cytarabine in continuous infusion, patients were evaluated for remission. Those who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomized between a long arm (five additional courses with two additional drugs; 16 weeks of treatment) and a short arm (two additional courses; 5 weeks). For patients in partial remission (PR), intensification of treatment was indicated. Two hundred sixteen patients were registered: 15 stage II nasopharyngeal and extensive facial tumors, 167 stage III, and 34 stage IV, 20 of the latter having more than 25% blast cells in bone marrow. The primary sites of involvement were abdomen in 172, head and neck in 30, thorax in two, and other sites in 12. One hundred sixty-seven patients are alive in first CR with a minimum follow-up of 18 months; four are lost to follow-up. Eight patients died from initial treatment failure, 14 died from toxicity or deaths unrelated to tumor or treatment, and 27 relapsed. The event-free survival (EFS), with a median follow-up of 38 months, is 78% (SE 3) for all the patients, 73% (SE 11) for the stage II patients, 80% (SE 3) for the stage III patients, and 68% (SE 8) for the stage IV and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. One hundred sixty-six patients were randomized: 82 in the short arm and 84 in the long arm. EFS is, respectively, 89% and 87%. Statistical analysis confirms equivalence of both treatment arms with regard to EFS. Moreover, morbidity was lower in the short arm. This study confirms the high survival rate obtained in the previous LMB 0281 study without radiotherapy or debulking surgery and demonstrates the effectiveness of short treatment. 
1	Effectiveness of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin combination chemotherapy in good-prognosis metastatic testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (CEB) was evaluated as initial chemotherapy in 76 patients with good-prognosis metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) between 1984 and 1988. The classification of eligible patients included Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) stages IM, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IV0ABCL1, and IV0ABL2. Four courses of combination chemotherapy were administered in a 21-day cycle, and surgical excision of residual mass was performed in 27 cases (23 laparotomies and four thoracotomies). At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 24 months from start of chemotherapy (range, 6 to 54 months). The 2-year cause-specific survival probability was 98.5%, the single cause-related mortality being caused by bleomycin pneumonitis. Five patients failed CEB chemotherapy, but all have been successfully salvaged with a combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy, follow-up from completion of all treatment being 35 to 44 months. The toxicity of CEB included bone marrow suppression and alopecia in all patients but no significant neurotoxicity or ototoxicity, and minimal renal toxicity. Only four (5%) patients had a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate greater than 15%. In 51% of patients, the hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL. The WBC count nadir was less than 1,500/microL in 11% of treatment cycles and in 16% the platelet nadir fell below 50,000/microL. Decreases in the WBC and platelet counts were of very brief duration. Only one of 310 CEB cycles was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and there were no episodes of thrombocytopenic purpura or bleeding. We conclude that the CEB combination represents an effective alternative to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in good-prognosis NSGCT and that the replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin leads to reduced toxicity. 
5	Dissection of the aorta associated with congenital malformation of the aortic valve. The association of congenital aortic valve malformation and aortic dissection is analyzed. Over a 30 year period, 186 patients with non-iatrogenic aortic dissection were studied at necropsy. The aortic valve was tricuspid in 170 (91.4%), bicuspid in 14 (7.5%) and unicuspid in 2 (1.1%). Among the 16 patients with aortic dissection and a congenitally malformed valve, the age at death ranged from 17 to 82 years (mean 52) and 13 (81%) were men. The entrance tear of the aortic dissection was located in the ascending aorta in all 16 patients with a malformed valve but in only 68% of those with a tricuspid aortic valve. The aortic valve was stenotic in 6 of the 16 patients with a congenitally malformed valve. Fatal rupture of the false channel occurred after acute ascending aortic dissection in each of the 11 patients (none with healed dissection) who did not have operative therapy for the dissection. Two of the 16 patients with a malformed valve compared with no patient with a tricuspid aortic valve had aortic isthmic coarctation. Histologic sections of aorta from 10 patients disclosed severe degeneration of the elastic fibers of the media in 9 patients. Thus, a congenitally malformed aortic valve appears to be present at least 5 times more frequently in adults with than in those without aortic dissection, and in our patients the entrance tear was always in the ascending aorta, which usually had severe loss of elastic fibers in its media. 
2	Bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, endoscopically indistinguishable from angiodysplasia, in an 8-yr-old boy. An 8-yr-old Japanese boy was hospitalized, complaining of active hematochezia. He was shown to have a cherry-red, blood-oozing area of vascular dilation with mucosal prominence in the sigmoid colon by endoscopy, but had no other mucocutaneous vascular abnormalities. A family history was noncontributory. Under the clinical diagnosis of angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon, he underwent an elliptical resection of the part, based on the intraoperative endoscopic findings. However, histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a totally different picture from that seen in angiodysplasia: the thin-walled, markedly ectatic, nontortuous veins with hemorrhage were seen only just below the muscularis mucosae, around which the normal ones were shown to coexist. He has had no rebleeding for the past 3 yr. This lesion is considered to be an isolated congenital visceral telangiectasia involving veins. 
1	Serial magnetic resonance imaging in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We prospectively performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies during the neonatal period, and at 4 and 8 months of age, on 15 term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and compared the results with their neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months of age. Cerebral palsy developed in nine infants, two infants were classified as having abnormalities of tone and delayed motor milestones that were suggestive of cerebral palsy, and four infants were normal. Structural abnormalities, delayed myelination, or a combination of the two were detected with MRI at 8 months of age in all nine infants with later development of cerebral palsy. Three of the four normal infants and one infant with suggestive abnormalities had normal serial MRI findings. Each of the remaining two infants (one normal, one with suggestive abnormalities) had isolated persistent ventricular dilation on all three MRI studies. Our results suggest that 8 months appears to be the earliest time at which MRI findings correlate well with later adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in this population. 
3	The efficacy of brainstem auditory evoked potentials in acoustic tumor surgery. As the identification of patients with small acoustic neuromas and salvageable hearing increases, intraoperative auditory nerve monitoring has been used increasingly in an attempt to improve the hearing preservation rate. Far-field recordings obtained by brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), at times enhanced by electrocochleography, have become a standard method of intraoperative auditory nerve assessment. To evaluate the usefulness of this monitoring technique, the hearing preservation results of a series of unmonitored acoustic tumor removals were compared to a series of patients monitored via the standard brainstem auditory evoked potentials. With comparable average tumor sizes, 4 of 7 unmonitored patients had hearing preserved at preoperative levels compared to 4 of 9 monitored patients. Neither preoperative BAEP assessments nor absolute tumor size were predictive of hearing preservation. This report brings into question the effectiveness of far-field intraoperative BAEP monitoring during acoustic tumor resection and suggests that direct auditory nerve monitoring may be more appropriate. 
2	Interferon alfa therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Effects on hepatitis B virus DNA in the liver. Pretrial and posttrial liver biopsy samples from 124 adult patients who participated in two randomized, controlled trials of interferon alfa therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were analyzed to determine the effects of interferon on the replication of HBV in the liver. Replicative forms of HBV DNA were detected in the pretrial biopsy samples from all and posttrial biopsy samples from 74% treated patients and 86% controls. Replicative forms of HBV DNA were detected in the posttrial biopsy samples from all patients who remained positive for hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in the serum, in 77% treated patients and 80% controls who cleared HBV DNA in the serum but who remained positive for hepatitis B e antigen, but in only 19% treated patients and 40% controls who cleared HBV DNA as well as hepatitis B e antigen in the serum. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly lower in patients whose posttrial biopsies did not contain replicative forms of HBV DNA. In summary, we demonstrated that in most patients with chronic HBV infection treated with interferon alfa, serological response was associated with the disappearance of replicative forms of HBV DNA in the liver. 
5	Evidence for motor neuropathy and reduced filling of the rectum in chronic intractable constipation. Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is now frequently offered to patients with slow transit constipation who have severe symptoms and no response to more conventional medical treatment. If this operation is to be successful, the underlying problem should be delay in the progress of contents through the colon but no mechanical or functional obstruction in the small bowel or rectum. We have used a recently described technique of prolonged ambulant manometry and electromyography to investigate anorectal function in these patients. Pressure data were collected using a 2 mm diameter intrarectal probe carrying microtransducers, and external anal sphincter activity was assessed by a pair of silver-silver chloride surface electrodes. Fourteen control subjects and eight patients with colonic inertia were studied. Sampling reflexes, indicative of rectal filling, occurred at mean (SEM) rates of 7.4 (2.0)/hour in controls but were significantly reduced in patients (2.4 (0.3)/hour (p less than 0.01]. Recurrent rectal motor complexes were seen to occur in both groups at intervals of 76 (1.8) minutes in controls and 64.9 (7.2) minutes in patients (p less than 0.1), and with amplitudes of 42.4 (2.1) mmHg and 9.2 (0.7) mmHg (p less than 0.001), respectively. External sphincter electromyographic spike activity did not differ between groups. Our results support the concept of reduced transit of faeces to the rectum from the colon over a 24 hour period in slow transit constipation and suggest that a motor neuropathy may also be present in the rectum. 
5	Periapical lesions of mandibular bone: difficulties in early diagnostics. It is often difficult to establish a correct diagnosis on the basis of initial clinical and roentgenologic symptoms in mandibular bone disease. In this paper these problems are discussed, and some suggestions are made to overcome them. The discussion is based on cases of osteogenic sarcoma, histiocytic lymphoma, and chronic osteomyelitis. The patients were a boy and two middle-aged women, all of them with primary clinical symptoms of pain and swelling, diffuse roentgenologic changes in mandibular bone, uncertain response to treatment, and an unusual progress of the disease. 
2	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. With more than 500,000 cholecystectomies performed per year, great interest has developed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure offers the patient reduced hospital stay, faster return to work, less pain, and improved cosmetic results. In September 1988, we developed a technique of performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy that we have now performed in more than 800 cases with good results. The technique allows the surgeon to fully evaluate the common duct via operative cholangiography and has allowed us to use a laparoscopic approach in all patients who were candidates for cholecystectomy. The technique offers a minimally invasive alternative to open cholecystectomy. 
5	Maternal serum screening for aneuploid pregnancy by alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, and unconjugated estriol. A number of serum screening protocols are either currently in use or proposed to identify pregnant women under 35 years of age who are at increased risk for a Down syndrome fetus. It has been suggested that these same screening methods be applied to gravidas over 35 years of age to identify those women who should be offered amniocentesis. To evaluate the efficacy of screening for detection of aneuploid pregnancy in this age group, the serum samples of 34 women who underwent amniocentesis and who had confirmed fetal aneuploidy were assayed for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), hCG, and unconjugated estriol (E3). These concentrations were compared with those of 85 women with known euploid pregnancy who underwent amniocentesis for advanced maternal age. The mean multiple of the median (MoM) for each of the three markers was significantly different from control values in cases of trisomy 21 (AFP median MoM = 0.82; unconjugated E3 median MoM = 0.77; and hCG median MoM = 1.89). These differences were not found when other aneuploidies were considered. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cases and controls and examined for their ability to predict the need for amniocentesis, based on currently recommended risk levels. There was a significant difference between the mean likelihood ratio for cases of trisomy 21 compared with that of controls (mean likelihood ratio = 13.48); there was no significant difference for other aneuploidies (mean likelihood ratio = 1.08). Of the 16 cases of trisomy 21 analyzed, four would not have been diagnosed antenatally if recommendation against amniocentesis had been made based on each woman's individual age-specific risk as modified by her likelihood ratio. 
1	Predicting radionuclide bone scan findings in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate cancer: prostate specific antigen is superior to all other clinical parameters. Presently, the standard staging evaluation of prostate cancer includes digital rectal examination, measurement of serum tumor markers and a radionuclide bone scan. To evaluate the ability of local clinical stage, tumor grade, serum acid phosphatase, serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) to predict bone scan findings, a retrospective review of 521 randomly chosen patients (mean age 70 years, range 44 to 92 years) with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate cancer was performed. Local clinical stage, tumor grade, acid phosphatase, PAP and PSA all correlated positively with bone scan findings (p less than 0.0001). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, however, PSA had the best over-all correlation with bone scan results. The median serum PSA concentration in patients with a positive bone scan was 158.0 ng./ml., whereas men with a negative bone scan had a median serum PSA level of 11.3 ng./ml. (p less than 0.0001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, local clinical stage, tumor grade, acid phosphatase and PAP were evaluated in combination with PSA to assess whether these parameters increased the ability of PSA alone to predict bone scan findings. None of these clinical parameters, irrespective of the combination used, contributed appreciably to the predictive power of PSA alone. A probability plot with 95% confidence intervals was constructed that allows the practicing urologist to estimate on an individual basis the probability of a positive bone scan for any given serum PSA value. The most significant finding of this study, however, was the negative predictive value of a low serum PSA concentration for bone scan findings. In 306 men with a serum PSA level of 20 ng./ml. or less only 1 (PSA 18.2 ng./ml.) had a positive bone scan (negative predictive value 99.7%). This finding would suggest that a staging radionuclide bone scan in a previously untreated prostate cancer patient with a low serum PSA concentration may not be necessary. 
4	Transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping assessment of atrial septal defect. Transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging was performed in 19 adult patients (mean age 35 years) with an atrial septal defect demonstrated by cardiac catheterization or at surgery, or both. The transesophageal study correctly identified and classified 19 of 19 shunts in contrast to 16 of 18 shunts identified by the transthoracic approach. The area of the atrial septal defect was calculated by assuming it to be circular and taking the maximal Doppler color flow jet width at the defect site as its diameter. The pulsed Doppler sample volume was placed parallel to the shunt flow direction at the defect site to obtain the mean velocity and flow duration. From these values, the shunt volume was calculated as a product of the defect area, mean velocity, flow duration and heart rate. The calculated shunt flow volume obtained by transesophageal study showed a good correlation with shunt flow volume (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) obtained at cardiac catheterization. The size of the defect by transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping correlated fairly well with the size estimated at surgery (r = 0.73, p = 0.004). It is concluded that transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging is useful in the detection and classification of atrial septal defects and in the assessment of shunt volumes. 
5	Ki67 index and S-phase fraction in human breast carcinomas. Comparison and correlations with prognostic factors. In a prospective study of 148 consecutive breast adenocarcinomas, proliferative indices of the same surgical tumor sample were performed by immunohistologic staining (Ki67 index) with the use of the Ki67 monoclonal antibody, which binds to a nuclear antigen only expressed in cycling cells, and by flow cytometry-derived S-phase fraction (SPF). Measurable Ki67 and SPF indices were obtained in 142 cases and 99 cases, respectively, and in 96 cases by both methods. In aneuploid tumors, a significant but low (P less than 0.05, r = 0.3) relationship was observed between Ki67 index and SPF. When compared with clinical, pathologic, and biochemical parameters these two proliferative indices were shown to be associated with nuclear grading and mitotic index. Additionally, correlations were observed between Ki67 index and node involvement (P less than 0.02) and between SPF and estrogen receptors (P = 0.002). These results show that (1) proliferative indices are obtained in 96% of surgical samples with Ki67 versus 67% with SPF and that (2) Ki67 index and SPF may provide complementary data with respect to prognosis. 
3	Murine retroviral neurovirulence correlates with an enhanced ability ofvirus to infect selectively, replicate in, and activate resident microglial cells [published erratum appears in Am J Pathol 1991 May;138(5):1058] To determine the biologic basis of ts1 MoMuLV neurovirulence in vivo, newborn CFW/D mice were inoculated with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wt MoMuLV and the temporal response to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), spleen, and thymus was studied comparatively. Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection. 
1	Endosonography of pararectal lymph nodes. In vitro and in vivo evaluation. One hundred thirteen patients with carcinoma of the rectum were evaluated for lymph node metastases by endorectal ultrasound. With the use of 7.5 MHz and based on different echo patterns, two main groups of lymph nodes can be differentiated: hypoechoic and hyperechoic lymph nodes. Compared with pathologic findings, hypoechoic lymph nodes represent metastases, whereas hyperechoic lymph nodes are visualized due to unspecific inflammation. Lymph node metastases can be predicted with a sensitivity of 72 percent and inflammatory lymph nodes with a specificity of 83 percent. The physical basis of the differentiation of lymph nodes was assessed in vitro by the determination of ultrasound parameters (speed of sound, acoustic impedance, attenuation, and backscattered amplitude). The attenuation coefficient of benign lymph nodes [2.5 dB/(MHz x cm)] is significantly higher than the mean value of lymph node metastases [1.3 db/(MHz x cm)]. The results demonstrate that involved nodes can principally be differentiated from not involved nodes. Micrometastases, mixed lymph nodes, and changing echo patterns within inflammatory nodes explain the accuracy rate of 78 percent. 
4	Assessment and counseling of coronary risk factors by family practice residents. A study was undertaken to determine (1) the likelihood that patients seen for episodic health care in a family medical center have been assessed and counseled for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, and (2) the likelihood that patients having an identified risk factor have been assessed and counseled regarding other CHD risk factors. One thousand five hundred twenty-eight medical records were randomly selected from all visits occurring over two periods in 1986 and 1987 to 122 residents in an eight-site family medicine residency network. Patients with cardiovascular disease and those younger than 20 or older than 65 years of age were excluded. Assessments were made of (1) smoking history, blood pressure, weight, physical activity, and dietary content during the previous 12 months; (2) family history of cardiovascular disease during the previous 12 months and in the initial patient history; (3) and blood cholesterol during the prior 5 years. Risk-factor counseling practices were examined for the previous 12 months. Blood pressure was assessed in 96% of patients, smoking in 40%, cholesterol in 26%, and family history in 52%. Ninety-six percent of hypertensive patients were counseled for hypertension, but only 45% of smokers and 20% of patients with hypercholesterolemia were counseled for those risk factors. Of patients having a given risk factor, assessment for any other risk factor occurred in fewer than 60% of cases. Patients having a documented positive family history were only slightly more likely than other patients to be assessed for additional risk factors. There is continued need for enhancing coronary risk-factor assessment and counseling by resident physicians. 
4	Ventricular late potentials and induced ventricular arrhythmias after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death are rare but recognized complications after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. We prospectively studied 31 patients (19 boys and 12 girls, mean age +/- standard deviation 7 +/- 4 years) with postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, by means of right-sided cardiac catheterization, 24-hour Holter monitoring, body-surface and intracavitary signal-averaging (gain 10(5) to 10(6), filters of 100 and 300 Hz) and programmed ventricular stimulation (1 and 2 extrastimuli, 3 basic cycle lengths, right ventricular apex and outflow tract). All patients were asymptomatic and none had documented or suspected ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular late potentials were detected in 10 of 31 patients (32%) and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in 12 of 31 patients (39%). No sustained VT was induced by programmed ventricular stimulation but nonsustained VT was induced in 3 patients (10%). Patients with inducible VT more often had late potentials (3 of 3 vs 7 of 28, p less than 0.01), and spontaneous ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) during Holter monitoring (3 of 3 vs 9 of 28, p less than 0.05). To predict VT inducibility, late potentials had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 75%, a positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 100%. For spontaneous VPCs, the figures were 100, 68, 25 and 100%, respectively. It is concluded that shortly after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, the presence of both spontaneous VPCs and ventricular late potentials are associated with an increased incidence of inducible VT. Conversely, the absence of VPCs and ventricular late potentials may identify patients at low risk of subsequent ventricular arrhythmias. 
1	The value of immunohistochemistry for collagen IV expression in colorectal carcinomas. The Dukes' classification has well-established prognostic value in colorectal cancer patients. Yet, in each Dukes' class, the survival of individual patients may vary considerably. Recent studies show prognostic significance of genetic alterations in colorectal carcinoma. However, the importance of tumor stromal components noted in the surrounding tissue may have been overlooked by the methods used. Therefore, in a longitudinal study of 154 patients with colorectal cancer operated on between 1967 and 1974, the authors determined the influence on prognosis of lymphocytic infiltration and expression of collagen type IV in tumor stroma. Also, age, sex, Dukes' classification, grade of tumor differentiation, vasoinvasion, and the number of positive lymph nodes were analyzed. Follow-up was at least 15 years. Lymphocytic infiltration and collagen IV expression were scored as mild, moderate, or severe. Survival was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model. The density of lymphocytic invasion showed no significant influence on survival. Collagen IV expression analyzed as a single variable was significantly (P = 0.038) related to better prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. By multi-variate analysis collagen IV expression showed a trend toward better prognosis that was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Dukes' classification (P less than 0.001), the presence of vasoinvasion (P = 0.009), and lymph node status (P = 0.04) significantly influenced survival. In conclusion immunohistochemistry for collagen IV is an important additional staining technique with prognostic value. In addition, collagen IV immunostaining facilitates recognition of vascular invasion by highlighting the basement membrane of vessels. 
3	Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures. Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy. We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors. After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline. After right lobectomy, there was no change. Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks. 
5	Intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia during carotid surgery. One of the problems in carotid surgery is the intraoperative detection of brain ischemia. None of the methods (EEG; stump pressure) applied so far have been successful. Branston et al. (1974) found a threshold relationship between cortical cerebral blood flow and cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). As the local blood flow fell below about 16 ml/100 g/min a progressive reduction occurred in the amplitude of the cortical evoked potential (N20/P25), implying a fundamental failure of neuronal function in the somatosensory cortex. We have monitored cortical SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) during 734 CEA's (carotid endarterectomies) in order to find an index of risk of incipient cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping, to determine the need for shunting and the causes of early irreversible neurologic deficits. In 59 cases evaluation of SEP was not possible because of technical difficulties. During 586 CEA's no alteration of SEP occurred. However, 4 patients had an immediate postoperative neurologic deficit, while the SEP remained normal. Abnormal SEP occurred in 89 cases and in 6 of these an irreversible loss of SEP was seen. These patients awoke with a new neurologic deficit. We found a reversible abnormal SEP in 83 cases. Reversible changes of SEP occurred mainly during carotid clamping. The diagnostic sensitivity of intraoperative SEP monitoring in predicting neurologic outcome was 60% with a specificity of 100%. 
5	The butterfly rash and the malar flush. What diseases do these signs reflect? The butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders. Systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs. In pellagra, symmetric keratotic areas on the face are always accompanied by lesions elsewhere on the body. Erysipelas produces brawny, fiery red facial lesions, and scarlet fever causes facial eruptions as part of a generalized eruption. Lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face. Carcinoid syndrome often causes flushing attacks that vary in duration, and facial flushing that lasts throughout treatment may accompany chemotherapy if the patient has a hypersensitivity reaction. Deep-red rashes and/or lichenoid lesions may be caused by graft-versus-host disease in a patient undergoing bone marrow transplantation. 
1	Familial ovarian cancer in Israeli Jewish women. Among 310 women with ovarian cancer of epithelial origin, eight ovarian cancer-prone families were identified, accounting for 24 cases. Five first-degree relatives underwent prophylactic oophorectomy, and early ovarian carcinoma was diagnosed in one of them. Familial aggregation of ovarian cancer occurs in the Israeli Jewish population. 
1	Use of various epithelial tumor markers and a stromal marker in the assessment of cervical carcinoma. The epithelial cell tumor markers squamous cell carcinoma antigen, CA 125, CA 15-3, and TAG 72, and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, an indicator of collagen metabolism, were evaluated in 111 cervical carcinoma patients. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen was pathologic in 47%, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in 40%, CA 125 in 13%, CA 15-3 in 30%, and TAG 72 in 9% of the 91 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The squamous cell carcinoma antigen, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, and CA 125 correlated with the clinical stage. The predictive value of a pathologic squamous cell carcinoma antigen was 78% and that of a negative result 68%. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen further increased the detection rate by approximately 20% from that obtained by squamous cell carcinoma antigen alone. In 16 patients with advanced disease, squamous cell carcinoma antigen correlated with the behavior of the disease in eight, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in nine, and CA 125 in six patients. Pathologic squamous cell carcinoma antigen, CA 125, CA 15-3, TAG 72, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen appeared in 11, 32, 31, 31, and 47% of 19 patients with adenocarcinoma, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen is clinically useful in squamous cell carcinoma but poor in adenocarcinoma, for which the other markers are better. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen, CA 125, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be used for monitoring the behavior of advanced squamous cell carcinoma. 
4	Possible mechanisms of abnormal norepinephrine sensitivity and reactivity of resistance vessels and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. A hypothesis. This study examined structural and functional changes of mesenteric resistance vessels in early, developing, and established stages of hypertension development in spontaneously hypertensive rats in an attempt to identify possible mechanisms of the development and maintenance of hypertension. Our results suggest that the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be caused by genetic structural and functional abnormalities of resistance vessels. Both abnormalities may be caused by hyperreactivity to norepinephrine through an altered signal transduction process, including the regulation of protein kinase C in smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
5	Artificial urinary sphincter insertion in congenital neuropathic bladder. A series of 44 patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction due to congenital myelodysplasia underwent implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS); in 26 patients a reconstructive procedure was performed at the same time. Five patients who initially had AUS implantation alone developed detrusor hyper-reflexia and required a clam cystoplasty. Forty patients (90%) are continent, 2 are occasionally damp and 2 are wet and awaiting further surgery; 66% of patients who underwent AUS insertion and reconstruction were found to have significant residual urine and they perform intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). In patients with a good bladder capacity and normal compliance and detrusor hyper-reflexia controlled by anticholinergic drugs, cystoplasty is not necessary at the time of AUS insertion. 
3	Delirium: masquerades and misdiagnosis in elderly inpatients. Delirium is an organic mental disorder defined as transient, fluctuating global dysfunction of cognition. It is common in elderly medical inpatients, yet its varied presentation is often missed or misdiagnosed. 
2	Colonic motor activity in acute colitis in conscious dogs. The changes in motor activity of the colon during acute colitis were investigated in six conscious dogs. The motor activity was recorded with seven strain-gauge transducers. Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon. 
4	Timing of corticosteroid treatment. Effect of lung lymph dynamics in air injury in awake sheep. In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury. 
5	A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization. A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. 
5	Ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors are characterized by trisomy 12. Eleven ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors including 1 thecoma, 2 fibromas, 6 fibrothecomas, and 2 granulosa cell tumors, were karyotyped after direct harvest and/or short-term tissue culture. Bilateral fibrothecomas from one patient appeared to lack cytogenetic aberrations: the remaining nine tumors were characterized by trisomy for chromosome 12. Cytogenetic aberrations in the two granulosa cell tumors were much less complex than those described previously in undifferentiated carcinomas; accordingly cytogenetic analyses might be useful in distinguishing these categories. The consistent occurrence of trisomy 12 in different varieties of granulosa-stromal cell tumors suggests a common mechanism of oncogenesis within this diverse group of neoplasms. That mechanism probably involves promotion of low-grade, orderly cell proliferation. 
1	The management of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The management of nine patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei was reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection of tumor is the standard of treatment, with many patients requiring multiple laparotomies. Chemotherapy, including the use of cisplatin is not effective. Long-term nutritional support provides a better quality of survival for select patients. 
5	Surgical removal of subfoveal neovascularization in the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. We treated two patients with presumed ocular histoplasmosis, subfoveal neovascular membranes, and progressive visual acuity loss to 20/400. Vitreoretinal surgical techniques were used to remove the subfoveal membranes. Visual acuity returned to 20/20 with seven months of follow-up in one patient (Case 1) and to 20/40 with three months of follow-up in the other patient (Case 2). No evidence of persistent or current subretinal neovascular membranes in either patient have been noted. These preliminary results suggest that vitreoretinal surgical techniques may be successful in mechanically removing subfoveal neovascular membranes with preservation of overlying neurosensory retina and thus preservation of central visual acuity. 
1	Multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma: report of a case with anogenital pruritus at presentation. A case of multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma of the perianal skin and vulva in a 79-year-old woman is presented, and the embryologic basis for the multicentricity is discussed. Histologically, cloacogenic carcinoma can be differentiated from other small cell neoplasms that affect the area. Cloacogenic carcinoma should be considered a rare cause of anogenital pruritus. It is important to perform an early biopsy of anogenital lesions that do not respond to conventional therapy. 
5	A comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of cefotetan and cefoxitin in surgical prophylaxis. Safety and efficacy were evaluated and compared retrospectively in 77 patients who received cefotetan (CTN) and 51 patients who received cefoxitin (CFX) for surgical prophylaxis. Both groups were similar with respect to age and gender. Surgical procedures were similar between groups (e.g., obstetric/gynecologic, renal transplant, colon, exploratory laparotomy, gastroduodenal, hernia repair). Postoperative infectious complications were more common in the CTN group (11.6 percent [9/77]) than in the CFX (7.8 percent [4/51]) group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. A higher incidence of wound infections was noted in the CTN group (5.2 percent [4/77]) than in the CFX group (2.0 percent [1/51]); this difference was also not significant. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy were more likely to develop infectious complications when CTN was used for prophylaxis (p = 0.0001). Clinically significant blood loss was not noted during surgery. Elevations in prothrombin times (greater than 1 sec) occurred in 27.3 percent (3/11) of CTN and 11.1 percent (1/9) of CFX patients (not significant). Except for the small subset of patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, CTN appeared to be as safe and effective as CFX when used for surgical prophylaxis. Although not statistically significant, the increased incidence of wound infections in the CTN-treated patients requires further study in a prospective randomized comparison. 
1	High-dose chemoradiotherapy supported by marrow infusions for advanced neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study [published erratum appears in J Clin Oncol 1991 Jun;9(6):1094] We conducted a pilot protocol at seven Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) institutions to examine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of using a common regimen of high-dose chemoradiotherapy (HD CT/RT) supported by autologous or allogeneic marrow infusions in children with metastatic neuroblastoma (NBL) in first or second remission. During a 57-month period, we accrued 101 patients. We report here results for the 81 who completed treatment at least 2 years ago. The HD CT/RT regimen consisted of melphalan 60 mg/m2/d for three doses, and total body irradiation (TBI) either 1.5 Gy (n = 27) or 2.0 Gy (n = 54) twice daily for six doses. Twenty-three patients also received irradiation consisting of 1.2 Gy twice daily for 10 doses to persisting disease sites. Seventy-four were given autologous and seven allogeneic marrow, 64 autologous marrows being purged immunomagnetically. Fifty-four children were in first complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission and 27 in second CR or PR. As of October 1, 1990, follow-up was from 32 to 72 months. Forty-seven of these 81 children relapsed, 10 died of complications, one of unknown cause, and 23 continue in remission, including 21 of the 54 treated in first remission, and 16 who completed treatment more than 3 years ago. The 2-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS) probabilities are first CR (CR1) 32% (SE 10%), first PR (PR1) 43% (SE 9%), second CR (CR2) 33% (SE 27%), and second PR (PR2) 5% (SE 5%). Probability of EFS correlated with remission number (first better than second, P less than .001), with interval from diagnosis to HD CT/RT (greater than 9 months better than less than 9 months, P = .055), and with TBI dose (12 Gy better than 9 Gy, P = .031). These encouraging results may partly reflect selection for this treatment of patients with NBL who have a slower disease pace. 
1	Regulation of HLA class II molecule expressions by IFN-gamma. The signal transduction mechanism in glioblastoma cell lines. We examined the signal transduction mechanism responsible for the IFN-gamma-induced HLA class II molecule expressions on glioblastoma cell lines, T98G and A172. A series of experiments demonstrated that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G cells. In addition to the activation of PKC, calcium influx appeared to be involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G. Northern blot analyses with actinomycin D or cycloheximide revealed that these second messengers induce the transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, we examined the region of the DPB gene that is responsible for IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription by gene transfer of a series of 5' and 3' deletion mutants in which the upstream region of the DPB was linked to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. By using these deletion mutants, it appeared that the region between -152 and -126 bp contains a critical IFN-gamma-responsive element. Taken together, these results suggest that IFN-gamma activates PKC and stimulates calcium influx, resulting in the induction of transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis. In DPB gene, we speculate that preexiting protein(s) phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of Ca2+ might directly bind or indirectly interact with the region between -152 and -126 bp of the upstream sequence, leading to the induction of the transcription (possibly in concert with other nuclear protein(s) bound to the promoter sequences). 
4	Alcohol and pyruvate cardioplegia. Twenty-four-hour in situ preservation of hamster hearts. Isolated hamster hearts were first perfused with a normal Krebs-Henseleit medium to demonstrate comparable viability of hearts before perfusing and storing them for 24 hours in one of three solutions. The three solutions were a physiologic saline with pyruvate as the substrate and 4% alcohol to arrest the heart (group 1), a standard cardioplegic solution (group 2), and an alcohol-free physiologic saline with pyruvate as the substrate (group 3). Recovery in terms of rate/pressure product and oxygen consumption after 30 minutes of reperfusion was 81% and 93%, respectively, for group 1, 13% and 32% for group 2, and 70% and 72% for group 3. Percent of physiologic recovery was not related to recovery of adenosine triphosphate. The adenosine triphosphate level returned to approximately 40% control level in all three groups, and in all three groups inorganic phosphate remained approximately 320% over control level after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Phosphocreatine level significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2, as a result of improved oxygen consumption. Intracellular pH, determined by phosphorous 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was physiologic in groups 1 and 3 but alkaline in group 2. This alkalinity may have been caused by leaky membranes. Pyruvate helped preserve mitochondrial function during depressed oxygen delivery, such as was seen during the 24-hour storage period. Four percent alcohol arrested the heart; combined with pyruvate plus alcohol solution were better than a standard cardioplegic solution for maintaining functional capability. 
1	Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans. The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia. Sampling was done in the peripheral artery, the mesenteric vein in five of the six patients, the hepatic vein, and the peripheral vein, as well as in urine. Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure. Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11. No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred. The total body clearance exceeded the hepatic clearance by 38%. It was concluded that the extrahepatic extraintestinal clearance of morphine probably occurred through the kidney. 
5	Through-knee amputation in high-risk patients with vascular disease: indications, complications and rehabilitation. During a 10-year period 104 patients (mean age 72 years) had 106 through-knee amputations. Indications for surgery were: limb gangrene, 67 (64 per cent); ischaemic ulceration, 22 (21 per cent); rest pain, 9; knee contractures, 6. Thirty patients had had previous unsuccessful vascular reconstructive surgery and five had had a failed femoral embolectomy. The through-knee disarticulation used lateral skin flaps. The mortality was 21 (20 per cent). Of the 83 survivors, 59 (71 per cent) underwent uncomplicated primary wound healing; 36 (43 per cent) of the survivors were unsuitable for rehabilitation on a prosthesis. The remaining 47 (57 per cent) were walking before discharge 30-130 days (mean 68 days) after amputation. Through-knee amputation is a rapid, relatively bloodless, amputation and is a useful debridement procedure. The many surgical and functional advantages, in conjunction with the recent reports of better rehabilitation compared with the above-knee or Gritti-Stokes amputation, suggests that the through-knee amputation deserves greater consideration. 
4	Multiplexing studies of effects of rapid atrial pacing on the area of slow conduction during atrial flutter in canine pericarditis model. BACKGROUND. We report that rapid atrial pacing interrupts atrial flutter when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse is blocked in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit. To characterize the area of slow conduction during atrial flutter and rapid pacing, we studied 11 episodes of induced atrial flutter, mean cycle length 157 +/- 20 msec, in eight dogs with sterile pericarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Atrial electrograms were recorded simultaneously from 95 pairs of right atrial electrodes during the interruption of atrial flutter by rapid atrial pacing, mean cycle length 139 +/- 21 msec. Areas of slow conduction during atrial flutter were demonstrated at one to three sites in the reentry circuit. After rapid pacing captured the reentry circuit, one area of slow conduction either disappeared (10 episodes) or the degree of slow conduction in an area of slow conduction decreased (one episode). Both changes were in association with activation of the region by a wave front from the pacing impulse that arrived from a direction different than that during the induced atrial flutter. Interruption of atrial flutter during rapid pacing occurred when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse blocked in an area of slow conduction that had either newly evolved during rapid pacing (seven episodes) or that was previously present (four episodes). CONCLUSIONS. Areas of slow conduction present during atrial flutter and rapid pacing of atrial flutter are functional and depend on both the atrial rate and the direction of the circulating wave fronts. Interruption of atrial flutter by rapid pacing results from block of the orthodromic wave front of the pacing impulse in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit. 
1	The recombinant immunotoxin anti-Tac(Fv)-Pseudomonas exotoxin 40 is cytotoxic toward peripheral blood malignant cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a recombinant single-chain immunotoxin containing the heavy and light variable regions of the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody fused to a mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). Anti-Tac binds to the p55 subunit of the human interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor, and anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 kills human or monkey cell lines that contain either the intact IL-2 receptor or its p55 subunit alone. To assess the usefulness of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 in treatment of IL-2 receptor-positive leukemia, we tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six patients with adult T-cell leukemia. In each of the six patients, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was extremely cytotoxic to the malignant cells. Metabolic activity and sensitivity of the fresh cells improved when a small amount of IL-2 (10 units per ml) was present during incubation. The toxin concentration necessary to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% after 16-hr incubation of cells with immunotoxin varied from 1.6 to 16 ng/ml (2.5-25 x 10(-11) M). In every case, binding was by means of the Tac antigen because anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 cytotoxicity was prevented by adding excess anti-Tac antibody. Moreover, anti-Tac alone or an inactive mutant of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 without ADP-ribosylation activity had very little cytotoxic activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls, from a patient with Tac-negative leukemia, and from adult T-cell leukemia patients without significant peripheral blood involvement were not sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40. These results indicate that anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a potent cytotoxin against adult T-cell leukemia cells in vitro and warrants clinical testing. 
4	Sequential or fixed sample trial design? A case study by stochastic simulation. The properties of Wilcoxon's rank sum test for fixed sample size and a Wilcoxon-type two-sample sequential test have been illustrated and compared by means of stochastic simulation. Data from a real fixed sample trial have been used, both for resampling from the original data, and for construction of an idealized theoretical distribution. The sequential and the fixed sample test obtain equal power, but the sequential test mostly includes considerably fewer patients to reach a conclusion, i.e. the mean and median number of patients included are both much lower than the fixed sample size. Under the hypotheses only a small fraction of the simulation runs exceed the fixed sample size. These findings exemplify results obtained in theoretical analyses and simulation studies covering a wide range of distributions. In our opinion sequential tests have obvious advantages and are in many cases better alternatives than fixed sample tests in clinical trials. 
1	Intracranial arachnoid cysts in children. A comparison of the effects of fenestration and shunting. The best operative intervention for children with arachnoid cysts remains the subject of controversy. Recent reports stress that craniotomy for cyst fenestration is associated with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality and may leave the child shunt-independent. The cases of 40 pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts treated between 1978 and 1989 are reported. Five children with mild symptoms and small cysts that remained stable on follow-up studies have not required surgical intervention. Of 15 patients with cysts initially treated by fenestration, 10 (67%) showed no clinical or radiographic improvement postoperatively and have undergone cyst-peritoneal (eight patients) or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting (one patient), or revision of a VP shunt placed for hydrocephalus before cyst fenestration (one patient). Two other patients with existing VP shunts required no further procedures. Thus, only three (20%) of 15 patients initially treated by fenestration remain shunt-independent after a median follow-up period of 8 years. The 20 other patients were initially treated by cysts shunting and all improved postoperatively; shunt revision has been necessary in six (30%) of these 20 patients because of cysts recurrence. Cyst location influenced the success of shunt treatment; none of the seven middle cranial fossa cysts treated by shunting have required revision, but results with cysts in other locations were less favorable. In all locations, though, shunting was more successful than fenestration. It is concluded that cyst-peritoneal or cyst-VP shunting is the procedure of choice for arachnoid cysts in most locations, including those in the middle cranial fossa. 
5	Antiepileptic drug intoxication: factors and their significance. A retrospective chart review (1979-1985) was performed to identify probable causes of intoxication with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We identified 141 patients meeting clinical and laboratory criteria for intoxication and 17 with clinical signs but with serum concentrations within the therapeutic range. The majority were epileptic patients; almost half were treated with monotherapy, most with phenytoin (PHT). The causes of intoxication in the epileptic patients were iatrogenic (41%), inappropriate dose self-adjustment (34%), suicide attempt (18%), inappropriate caretaker dose adjustment (9%), accidental ingestion (8%), unrecognized drug interaction (6%), and association with intercurrent illness (2%). Twenty-two patients had more than one probable cause of intoxication. In nonepileptic patients the causes were suicide attempt (50%), accidental ingestion (27%), and iatrogenic (23%). Most patients had signs of ocularmotor and vestibulocerebellar dysfunction. Rarely described manifestations of intoxication, such as seizures or choreoathethosis, were observed in a few patients. The average hospital stay was 6.9 days; there was no mortality, and all patients recovered fully. We conclude that AED intoxication is a major but preventable cause of morbidity and that suicide attempts are an important and underrecognized contributor in both epileptic and non-epileptic patients. 
4	Vascular and calcemic effects of plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Circulating substances that increase intracellular calcium, and other circulating substances that increase blood pressure, have been described in hypertensive animals and humans. In this study, we report the existence of a factor of the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats that does both. These effects were dose-dependent, and the time course for such effects was correlated with the time course for potentiation of pressor agents by the plasma. In addition, the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats was found to inhibit the depressor effects of parathyroid hormone. Our results confirm the presence of a circulating hypertensive factor in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats, which may act by increasing calcium uptake in vascular smooth muscle. These findings may also help explain the secondary increase in parathyroid hormone noted in some forms of human and experimental hypertension. 
3	Non-drug related asystole associated with anaesthetic induction. A patient is presented where routine venepuncture associated with anaesthetic induction resulted in bradycardia and asystole. The case highlights the need for special caution with, and ECG monitoring throughout induction for, patients with a history of syncope. It also demonstrates the need for caution when attributing cardiovascular events during induction to the effect of the induction agents used. 
3	Effect of the topical anesthetic EMLA on the efficacy of pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains. EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a new topical anesthetic composed of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine in an oil-in-water emulsion cream. It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children. However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment. We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment. One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment. The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA. The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site. We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment. 
2	Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in infantile cholestasis. The difficulty of distinguishing surgically correctable causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in infants from other causes means that some infants may undergo laparotomy and intraoperative cholangiography unnecessarily, and others may be referred for surgery too late. In an attempt to improve the diagnostic accuracy in infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when standard methods produced equivocal results, we have been using prototype paediatric duodenoscopes (PJF 7.5 and XPJF 8.0; Olympus) to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). From 159 infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, 11 were referred for ERCP, which was performed in nine. In four in whom bile ducts were definitely visualised laparotomy was avoided. Operative cholangiography confirmed patent bile ducts in one in whom visualisation had been uncertain. Three of four in whom bile ducts were not seen had extrahepatic biliary atresia. Visible bile drainage in the fourth excluded atresia. No major complications ensued but there was radiological evidence of gall bladder perforation in one (common hepatic duct block) and overinflation with air was a problem until finer cannulae (Wilson-Cook) were introduced. In appropriately selected patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ERCP with paediatric duodenoscopes in experienced hands may provide useful diagnostic information. 
5	Intrinsic vasodilation protects Wistar Kyoto rats from progressive glomerulosclerosis after unilateral nephrectomy. Genetically determined differences in functional and structural determinants that govern the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis (GS) were studied in aging sham-operated or unilaterally nephrectomized male rats of two strains. Wistar rats showed an increase of proteinuria and GS with age, which was enhanced by unilateral nephrectomy (UN). In contrast, intact and UN Wistar Kyoto rats did not show an increase of proteinuria with age and 7 months after UN, no GS was seen in these rats. Systemic blood pressure was comparable in both strains and was not affected by UN. Functional studies in a separate group of rats 1 month after UN showed an identical increase in glomerular filtration rate in both strains as compared with sham-operated controls. The Wistar rats did not show an effect of UN on renal plasma flow, and consequently, there was an increase in filtration fraction, in contrast to Wistar Kyoto rats, which showed an increase in renal plasma flow with an unchanged filtration fraction. Glomerular volume was increased in both strains at 1 month and 7 months after UN. Mesangial expansion was not observed at 1 month after UN in either strain, which indicates that this is not a decisive factor in the development of GS. These data indicate that the genetically determined susceptibility to the development of GS in these two rat strains may be related to the degree of vasoconstriction, whereas glomerular volume expansion per se does not lead to GS but can well be a consequence of hyperfiltration. These studies are concordant with previous studies that revealed the role of hemodynamics in the pathogenesis of GS irrespective of glomerular expansion. 
5	Renal artery stent placement with use of the Wallstent endoprosthesis. The Wallstent endoprosthesis was placed in 12 renal arteries of 11 patients; a total of 15 stents were placed. Indications for placement were restenosis after dilation and insufficient result after dilation. In two patients, malpositioning of the stent required placement of a second stent. Complications included a case of massive cholesterol embolization and a case of unexplained transient hematuria, proteinuria, and deterioration of renal function. At repeat angiography of seven renal arteries after stent placement, one was occluded and required thrombolysis and dilation. Another showed restenosis due to shortening of the stent and required redilation and, later, placement of another stent. This stent became occluded after 1 month. In this patient and in three other cases, angiography disclosed tissue buildup in the stent but without significant stenosis after this short-term follow-up. After a clinical follow-up of 6.7 months +/- 3.4 in 10 patients treated for hypertension, three were cured, four were improved, and three were unchanged when blood pressure levels before stent placement were compared with those obtained after stent placement. 
2	Iron and the liver. Iron is essential for life, but iron overload is toxic and potentially fatal. The liver is a major site of iron storage and is particularly susceptible to injury from iron overload, especially when (as in primary hemochromatosis) the iron accumulates in hepatocytes. Iron can be taken up by the liver in several forms and by several pathways including: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric or monoferric transferrin or ferritin, (2) reduction and carrier-facilitated internalization of iron from transferrin without internalization of the protein moiety of transferrin, (3) electrogenic uptake of low molecular weight, non-protein bound forms of iron, and (4) uptake of heme from heme-albumin, heme-hemopexin, or hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Normally, pathway 2 is probably the major one for uptake of iron by hepatocytes. Iron is stored in the liver in the cores of ferritin shells and as hemosiderin, an insoluble product derived from iron-rich ferritin. Iron in hepatocytes stimulates translation of ferritin mRNA and represses transcription of DNA for transferrin and transferrin receptors. The major pathologic effects of chronic hepatic iron overload are: (1) fibrosis and cirrhosis, (2) porphyria cutanea tarda, and (3) hepatocellular carcinoma. Although precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown, iron probably produces these and other toxic effects by increasing oxidative stress and lysosomal lability. Vigorous efforts at diagnosis and treatment of iron overload are essential since the pathologic effects of iron are totally preventable by early vigorous iron removal and prevention of iron re-accumulation. 
4	Incidence and clinical significance of ST segment elevation after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. To study the incidence and clinical significance of postshock ST segment elevations, we recorded 12-lead ECGs immediately after transthoracic direct-current electrical cardioversion in 146 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Among 23 patients (19%), acute ST segment elevations amounted to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mV (mean +/- SD) and occurred after 243 +/- 114 joules (cumulative dose) in the precordial leads only in 14, concomitantly in precordial and inferior leads in two, and in the precordial and anterolateral leads in seven. They normalized within 1.5 +/- 0.8 minutes. Occurrence of ST segment elevation was related to previous pericardiotomy (p less than 0.00001) and age (p = 0.01). Estimation of myocardial enzyme release did not show evidence of myocardial damage. Patients with ST segment elevations had a lower conversion rate (48% versus 76%, p = 0.005). Long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm was also diminished (35% versus 59%, p = 0.03). Results of this study show that postcardioversion ST segment elevation occurs predominantly in postpericardiotomy patients and may be associated with an unfavorable arrhythmia prognosis. 
3	Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 3. Intervention strategies. This self-directed learning module highlights advances in the principles of management of brain disorders. It is part of the chapter on rehabilitation in brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. This article covers rehabilitation philosophy, management of cognitive remediation, and behavioral management, with attention to communication disorders, social factors, vocational/educational/avocational issues, treatment of motor deficits, dysphagia, sensory dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and substance abuse. Advances that are covered in this section include pharmacologic and rehabilitative interventions for acute, chronic, and progressive brain injuries and diseases. The learner is directed to articles 1, 2, and 4 in this chapter for supporting information. 
2	The role of prostanoids in the production of acute acalculous cholecystitis by platelet-activating factor. Gallbladder tissue from patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis contains increased amounts of prostanoids when compared to normal gallbladder tissue. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent stimulus of eicosanoid formation. It has been implicated as a mediator of acute inflammatory processes and systemic responses to shock. In this study the role of PAF in acute acalculous cholecystitis was evaluated. Anesthetized cats underwent gallbladder perfusion with a physiologic buffer solution containing [14C]polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable tracer to quantitate mucosal water absorption. Platelet-activating factor was infused into the hepatic artery for 2 hours. Control experiments were performed when vehicle alone was infused. Experiments also were performed when indomethacin was administered intravenously and when indomethacin and PAF were administered. Gallbladder mucosal absorption/secretion and perfusate and tissue prostaglandin E (PGE) and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha) levels were evaluated. Gallbladder inflammation was evaluated by beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase tissue concentrations and by a histologic scoring system. Platelet-activating factor eliminated gallbladder absorption and produced net fluid secretion associated with dose-related increases in perfusate PGE concentrations and gallbladder tissue PGE and 6 keto PGF1 alpha levels when compared to control values. Platelet-activating factor produced significant inflammation in the gallbladder with increases in the histologic score of inflammation and tissue lysosomal enzyme activities. Indomethacin significantly decreased the fluid secretion, prostanoid levels, and inflammation produced by PAF. The results suggest that PAF may induce acute gallbladder inflammation associated with systemic stress through a prostanoid-mediated mechanism. 
3	Peroxisomal disorders. Although peroxisomes were once considered a vestige, their importance in cellular metabolism is clearly established by the many inherited diseases that have been described in the past two decades. Unfortunately there is no definitive treatment for the various disorders, but based on the recognition of the biochemical abnormalities, prenatal testing and appropriate genetic counseling can be provided. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of this group of diseases, as diagnosis and further study of these patients are essential in understanding the basic etiologic mechanisms underlying these complex groups of disorders. Clearly, there is much to be learned about the relationship between biochemical abnormalities and the phenotypic variability of the peroxisomal disorders. 
1	Management decisions in laryngeal carcinoma in situ. Twenty-one patients with laryngeal carcinoma in situ (n = 12) or carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (n = 9) were treated with laser mucosal dissection of the vocal cords and/or superficial laser cordectomy. The normal architecture of the vocal cords was preserved because the depth of vaporization was usually superficial in these early cases. Five patients had recurrence, new tumor, or persistence of abnormal tissue that required additional laser surgical treatments. With a follow-up range of 6 months to 4 years, all patients currently are free of laryngeal abnormality, and no patient has needed open laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy. Transoral endoscopic laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma in situ with or without microinvasion should be the treatment of choice for these early lesions. 
5	Avascular necrosis of bone: a common serious complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: To describe the incidence, presentation, clinical course, and management of avascular necrosis of bone following bone marrow transplantation, and to identify risk factors related to its development and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients developing avascular necrosis after transplantation between March 1974 and May 1988 were identified by means of the Minnesota Bone Marrow Transplant Database and hospital records and included in analysis. Of 902 consecutive patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, 28 developed avascular necrosis of bone. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 642 allogeneic transplant recipients (10.4% by product limit estimate) developed avascular necrosis compared to zero of 260 autologous transplant recipients. Symptoms developed 1 to 62 months (median 12 months) after transplantation. In the 28 patients a total of 91 joints were affected (mean 3.3 per patient, range one to eight joints). The hip joint was most often involved (64% of patients), followed by knee (61%), ankle (29%), shoulder (21%), and elbow (7%). Initial standard radiographs were negative in 13 patients, while in nine patients, technetium-99 scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated changes of osteonecrosis before changes on routine radiographs. Almost all patients had received steroid prophylaxis and therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We observed a significant correlation between the total cumulative dose of steroids and number of joints involved (p less than 0.01). A multivariate analysis (allogeneic transplant patients only) identified acute or chronic GVHD requiring steroid therapy (p = 0.003), and increasing age (p = 0.002) as significant and independent risk factors. Fourteen patients required surgery, including joint replacement in 11 patients. In six of six patients, hip core decompression failed to halt disease progression, and total hip arthroplasty was subsequently required. CONCLUSION: Avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent late complication of bone marrow transplantation, causing significant morbidity and often requiring surgery; diagnosis using conventional imaging techniques may be difficult and treatment remains inadequate. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging and tomographic evaluation of occlusal appliance treatment for advanced internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. This study evaluates the positional relationship of the disc and mandibular condyle in patients with late opening clicks treated with appliance therapy. A total of 30 joints (18 patients) were studied. Twenty-seven of these 30 joints were treated with the appliance until the joints were silent to auscultation. The patients were then evaluated with axial corrected tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the centric occlusion position and with their bite appliance (Sved-type) in place. Comparisons were made between condyle position in centric occlusion and with the appliance in place. Magnetic resonance imaging was then used to evaluate disc positional changes. Each imaging procedure was made in the same sagittal plane. Only changes in condyle positioning could be identified. Evidence of disc repositioning with the appliance in place was seen in only three MRI examinations. The remaining 27 joints continued to exhibit disc displacement with various changes in disc morphology. It is concluded that the concept of "disc capture" is a clinical term only, and that such perceived clinical success should not lead to the assumption that an actual change in intra-articular anatomic relationships has occurred. Joint noises may decrease because joint space is increased, allowing smoother condylar translation beyond disc surface irregularities and positional abnormalities. 
4	Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy. 
4	Restoration of sinus rhythm during two consecutive pregnancies in a woman with congenital complete heart block. In a woman with congenital complete heart block atrioventricular conduction was normal during two successive pregnancies. Pregnancy, labour, and delivery were uncomplicated on both occasions and complete heart block returned post partum. 
2	Perianal streptococcal cellulitis with penile involvement. Perianal streptococcal cellulitis is described occurring in a 5-year-old boy. The condition also involved the penis and presented as a possible case of sexual abuse. The correct diagnosis was established by culturing beta-haemolytic streptococci group A from the penile and perianal skin. 
5	The management of aneurysms and arterio-venous fistulae of the popliteal artery arising from war trauma. Emphasis on sigmoid operative approach. Between 1986-1988, 600 vascular cases arising from the Iran-Iraq conflict were dealt with within an 18 month period and 60 cases of popliteal artery and/or venous disruption were encountered presenting at variable times after injury. A policy of management between the forward and base hospital surgical teams was introduced, observing the following broad categorizations: (a) assessment/referral, (b) assessment/fasciotomy/referral, (c) immediate operation/referral for further operation/review/management. Two types of incision were used to enter the popliteal fossa: (a) a medial incision and (b) a sigmoid posterior incision (which we now favor). The results of this strategy of management and operative technique (when compared with our previous experience within the same time frame) suggested an improved outcome. Fifty-four out of 60 cases had a satisfactory operative result with below-knee amputation being required in only four cases and higher amputations in two others. No operative or postoperative deaths occurred. The implementation of this "vetting policy" at the front line appeared to reduce the number of amputations and assisted the clarification of management criteria in assessing limb viability at the forward hospital when a large number of casualties were being received. Operative access using the sigmoid posterior incision was not associated with any complications, offered better exposure than the medial incision and was technically easier for the surgeon to perform. 
5	Prognostic indicators of the resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survival of the fetus. To delineate any possible prognostic indicators, we reviewed the ultrasonographic and nonmorphometric findings in 19 antenatally diagnosed cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis in which it was chosen to continue the pregnancy. Thirteen fetuses died and six survived. Of all parameters examined, including associated anomalies, abnormal karyotype, location of serous fluid, anemia, and possible cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis, the most sensitive prognostic indicator was the real-time-directed M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the biventricular outer dimension in diastole. All fetuses with biventricular outer dimensions greater than 95% died, whereas all but one with normal biventricular outer dimensions had resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survived. This was highly significant (p less than 0.001) with the predictive value of a normal biventricular outer dimension being 86% and the predictive value of an enlarged biventricular outer dimension being 100%. 
1	Hormonal and enzymatic parameters of hepatic regeneration in patients undergoing major liver resections. Thirteen patients who underwent 40% to 80% removal of their livers had blood samples drawn initially and daily on postoperative days 1 to 7. The enzyme marker of heightened polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, and the indicator of DNA synthesis, thymidine kinase, were measured. In addition, the hormones (insulin, glucagon, estradiol and androgen), which in animals are known to reflect and possibly modulate regeneration, were measured. Changes in all these indices followed the same pattern as in rats, dogs and swine but at a slower rate. Ornithine decarboxylase and estradiol increased within 24 hr, but thymidine kinase and insulin rises did not become statistically significant until 3 to 5 days. Using these plasma or serum indices as surrogate measures of biochemical events in the liver itself, regeneration reached a maximum after 4 or 5 days. By computed tomography scan analysis, restoration of hepatic cell mass was not complete until 3 wk. 
1	Possible involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma. Retinoblastoma tumor formation is initiated by the loss of function of both alleles of the RB-1 gene on chromosome 13. Patients with the hereditary form of retinoblastoma carry a germ line mutation at one of the two homologous gene loci in all cells and have an increased risk for nonocular tumors (mainly osteosarcoma and other mesenchymal tumors) in later life. The authors studied a 38-year-old patient with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) who had been treated for bilateral retinoblastoma by enucleation (left eye) and irradiation (right eye), respectively. Using molecular probes for the RB-1 gene and other loci on chromosome 13, the authors detected a deletion at the RB-1 locus in metastatic SNUC cells that was not present in normal tissue. These findings indicate that somatic mutations at RB-1 locus may be involved in the formation or progression of ectodermal tumors. 
2	Pharmacokinetics and protein binding of cefpiramide in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetics of cefpiramide, a new cephalosporin, were investigated after a single 1 gm intravenous injection in 11 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and compared with those of 11 healthy subjects. In patients with cirrhosis the plasma elimination half-life was three times longer than that in normal subjects. The total plasma clearance was decreased significantly (p less than 0.001): 12.3 +/- 6.5 ml/min in patients and 25.6 +/- 4.6 ml/min in healthy volunteers, respectively. The urinary excretion of unchanged drug (percent of intravenous dose) for patients (69.8% +/- 29.9%) was statistically higher (p less than 0.01) than that for subjects (16.2% +/- 3.9%). The renal elimination became increasingly important with hepatic impairment. Protein binding of cefpiramide was reduced significantly in the group with cirrhosis. The average unbound fraction was 10.4% +/- 9.5% in patients with cirrhosis and 1.9% +/- 0.3% in normal subjects (p less than 0.01). Because the rate of elimination from plasma in patients is slower, the dosage regimen of cefpiramide would probably be modified in cirrhosis. 
3	Cognitive and behavioural impairment among elderly people in institutions providing different levels of care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in elderly patients in institutions providing different levels of care. DESIGN: Prevalence study. SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital. PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion. A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged). All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS). RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%). The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care. When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions. 
2	Effect of race upon organ donation and recipient survival in liver transplantation. The effect of the race of the donor on organ donation and on the outcome of clinical liver transplantation has not been addressed previously. The aims of this study were to determine: (1) the number of organs donated by each of the major racial groups of the United States, (2) the outcome of transplantation of these organs across racial groups, and (3) the pattern of liver disease that required transplantation in each of these racial groups. A significantly higher proportion of organs were donated by white non-Hispanic Americans than either black or Hispanic Americans. There was no significant difference in survival when an organ was transplanted between black and white Americans and vice versa. Postnecrotic cirrhosis from a variety of causes was the most common indicator affecting black and white recipients, while primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis were uncommon in the black population. While the number of organs donated by blacks was low, it was, however, proportional to the number of black recipients in this study. Reasons for the low rate of donation by the black and white Hispanic population are discussed. It is concluded that race is not a criteria to be used in selection of donors for liver transplantation. Educational programs addressing issues of organ donation and transplantation directed towards the black and Hispanic populations are recommended. 
5	Cytogenetic analysis of a granulocytic sarcoma in a patient without systemic leukaemia. Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare complication of leukaemia. Occasionally it presents before the development of systemic leukaemia when diagnosis may be difficult. A case of granulocytic sarcoma occurring in a patient with no overt evidence of leukaemia, but in whom cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow showed a clonal t(12;13) translocation, is reported. Cytogenetic analysis of tissues in this disease may indicate evidence of systemic disease before overt morphological changes. 
5	Impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry at myringotomy [published erratum appears in Pediatrics 1991 Jun;87(6):945] A total of 220 ears undergoing myringotomy and pressure-equalizing tube placement were studied with impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry in a direct comparison for detection of middle-ear effusion. Impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry were equally accurate, detecting the presence or absence of middle-ear effusion in 73% and 72% of ears, respectively. The presence of effusion in ears with tympanographic patterns other than type A and type B was not consistently and reliably predicted. The higher sensitivity of impedance tympanometry (90%) compared with that for acoustic reflectometry (58%) contrasted with the opposite findings for specificities (54% vs 88%). It is concluded that impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry measure different events at the tympanic membrane and their utility lies in the fact that they complement each other. These instruments can aid the experienced otoscopist in confirming a clinical impression and assist the less experienced clinician in validating or improving otoscopic skills. 
5	An angiographic technique for three-dimensional determination of arterial supply patterns in cadaver soft tissue. A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented. In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen. The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection. While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen. 
1	Risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay. From 1987 to 1989, a hospital-based case-control study of cancer of the tongue was conducted in Montevideo, Uruguay, as part of a large study to investigate a number of risk factors for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The study involved interviews with 57 cases and 353 controls and was restricted to men. Relative risks (RR) associated with tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and selected dietary items were obtained by unconditional logistic-regression analysis. Users of black tobacco had a RR fourfold higher than users of blond tobacco, and heavy drinkers of alcohol had a RR of 11.6. Infrequent consumption of vegetables was associated with a significant RR of 5.3, and heavy drinkers of the local infusion "mate" had a RR of 2.5. It was concluded that black tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking were the strongest risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay. Their effects combine according to a multiplicative model. Also, infrequent vegetable intake and mate ingestion contribute to the risk of cancer of the tongue. 
1	Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal septum. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of glandular tissue occurring in the head and neck region. There have been several reports of metastasis of this benign-appearing tumor from the salivary glands to distant sites, suggesting hematogenous spread and implantation. Although occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma on the nasal septum has been described, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of recurrent septal pleomorphic adenoma with histologically benign tissue in an enlarged metastatic ipsilateral submandibular lymph node, suggesting lymphatic spread. The literature concerning the subject is reviewed. Wide septal excision and modified neck dissection is the recommended treatment. 
1	Long survival and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied survival and prognostic factors in all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma seen at a Midwestern teaching hospital from 1947 through 1986. Of the 70 cases, 56 were diagnosed during life and 14 at autopsy. There were 47 males and 23 females with age at diagnosis ranging from 14 to 88. Median survival for the 56 patients diagnosed during life was 106 days. Only 11 patients lived longer than one year. Two patients were long survivors and presumed cured, one living 27 years after diagnosis and surgical treatment and the other 19 years. Cox regression model showed young age at diagnosis and low stage of disease at diagnosis to be significant predictors of long survival. White patients survived nearly twice as long as black patients but the difference was not significant. Gender and year of diagnosis did not appear to be important determinants of survival. Pathologic material was still available for one of the two long survivors and the histology was that of fibrolamellar carcinoma of young adults. 
5	Increase in skin-flap survival by the vasoactive drug buflomedil. The effect of buflomedil to protect skin tissue from ischemia and necrosis was studied in random cutaneous flaps. Measurements were performed by intravital microscopy on the microcirculatory level of capillary perfusion in a flap model in the hairless mouse. In 30 hairless mice, single-pedicle flaps measuring 6 x 16 mm were raised perpendicular to the spine of the animal. This flap develops a reliable amount of necrosis at its distal edge over a period of 7 days. A group of 10 mice received intravenous injections of buflomedil in doses of 3 mg/kg per day diluted in 0.1 ml normal saline beginning 4 hours before flap elevation and for 6 consecutive days postoperatively. In addition, 10 further animals received the same treatment except that it was started 5 minutes after flap elevation. In 10 mice serving as controls, normal saline in equal volumes as in the experimental groups was applied. By means of intravital microscopy, functional vessel density (FVD) was determined in 2.5-mm increments from the flap's base to its distal edge at 1, 6, and 24 hours after elevation. Skin-flap survival was quantified by measuring the necrotic area on day 7 by means of digital planimetry. Functional vessel density was preserved in the distal flap of animals pretreated with buflomedil, revealing a higher functional vessel density at 10.0 mm (p less than 0.01), 12.5 mm (p less than 0.05), and 15.0 mm (p less than 0.001) from the flap's base as compared with controls. 
4	The role of protein kinase C and calcium in the regulation of norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons in hypertension. This study was designed to investigate the role of protein kinase C and calcium in vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 on endogenous norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness during nerve stimulation. Endogenous norepinephrine release and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 inhibited the stimulation-induced norepinephrine release and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of these suppressive responses were more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. Calcium removal from extracellular fluid also reduced the norepinephrine release more strongly in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that the regulation of norepinephrine release might be more dependent on protein kinase C and calcium in the blood vessels of SHR, which could contribute, at least partially, to the pathogenesis of this form of hypertension. 
3	Tarsal tunnel syndrome in athletes. Case reports and literature review. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is being seen in increasing frequency in the athletic population, especially in the running athlete. The sports medicine physician must be cognizant of this entity, including proper diagnostic testing and management. 
4	Response to diet and cholestyramine in a patient with sitosterolemia. In this report, an 11-year-old boy with diffuse tendinous and tuberous xanthomatosis and a plasma sterol concentration of 555 mg/dL, consisting primarily of cholesterol, is described. Three months after changing from an unrestricted diet to a cholesterol-lowering diet, his plasma sterol concentration decreased to 221 mg/dL. Because of the degree and rapidity of his response to diet, sitosterolemia was suspected. According to results of capillary gas-liquid chromatography of his plasma sterols, there was a sitosterol concentration of 31.3 mg/dL (normal less than 1.0 mg/dL), establishing the diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Addition of cholestyramine therapy (8 g/d) to a low sterol diet further lowered his plasma sterol concentration to 173 mg/dL and led to complete regression of all tuberous xanthomata. Tendinous xanthomata regressed at a slower rate. These findings show that the diagnosis of sitosterolemia should be suspected in severely hypercholesterolemic children (total cholesterol greater than 400 mg/dL) whose plasma cholesterol level is highly responsive to dietary manipulation. The rapid and sustained lowering of plasma cholesterol and regression of xanthomata after treatment with diet and cholestyramine suggest that sitosterolemia is a treatable cause of premature atherosclerosis. 
5	Inter-arytenoid glottic bar following intubation. Inter-arytenoid glottic bar is a rare complication of prolonged endotracheal intubation. We present two such cases and their treatment. The aetiology of this complication is multifactorial and involves local factors--local trauma, movement of the endotracheal tube within the larynx, infection, and anatomical influences--together with systemic factors such as in our two cases. The relative importance of these factors is discussed. A comment is also made on the use of a pre-operative topogram and the importance of an ENT assessment in patients with airway problems following prolonged intubation. 
3	Cerebral palsy: why we must plan for survival. The survival of children in the South East Thames region, born between 1970 and 1979 and diagnosed as having some form of cerebral palsy was investigated. Of the 732 children studied, 651 (90%) are still alive, and hence cerebral palsy must be regarded as a condition with which people live rather than a condition of which they die. Survival varies considerably among the different diagnostic groups: those suffering from spasic quadriplegia, dyskinetic and 'mixed' cerebral palsy are most severely affected. Our evidence suggests that, though immobility and severe mental subnormality are the strongest predictors of mortality in children with cerebral palsy, the majority of even the most severely affected patients survive to adulthood. It is therefore appropriate to plan for their survival by funding and evaluating programmes to maximise health, independence, and quality of life. 
3	Malignant glandular triton tumor. A case of left brachial plexus-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing neoplastic, glandular, and rhabdomyoblastic elements in a 39-year-old Chinese man is reported. The authors suggested that this tumor be termed a malignant glandular triton tumor in view of the presence of the adenocarcinomatous component. The patient had extensive local recurrence comprising mainly the Schwann spindle cells within a year after complete piecemeal removal and died 15 months later after the initial presentation. The natural behavior of this tumor, as in other reported cases of malignant triton tumor, is extremely aggressive, unlike malignant schwannoma or glandular malignant schwannoma. The histogenesis of this tumor is likely to be from primitive neural crest cells, Schwann's cell precursors, or metaplastic malignant Schwann's cells. 
5	Phenotypic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta: the mildly affected mother of a proband with a lethal variant has the same mutation substituting cysteine for alpha 1-glycine 904 in a type I procollagen gene (COL1A1). A proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has been shown to have, in one allele in a gene for type I procollagen (COL1A1), a single base mutation that converted the codon for alpha 1-glycine 904 to a codon for cysteine. The mutation caused the synthesis of type I procollagen that was posttranslationally overmodified, secreted at a decreased rate, and had a decreased thermal stability. The results here demonstrate that the proband's mother had the same single base mutation as the proband. The mother had no fractures and no signs of OI except for short stature, slightly blue sclerae, and mild frontal bossing. As a child, however, she had the triangular facies frequently seen in many patients with OI. On repeated subculturing, the proband's fibroblasts grew more slowly than the mother's, but they continued to synthesize large amounts of the mutated procollagen in passages 7-14. In contrast, the mother's fibroblasts synthesized decreasing amounts of the mutated procollagen after passage 11. Also, the relative amount of the mutated allele in the mother's fibroblasts decreased with passage number. In addition, the ratio of the mutated allele to the normal allele in leukocyte DNA from the mother was half the value in fibroblast DNA from the proband. The simplest interpretation of the data is that the mother was mildly affected because she was a mosaic for the mutation that produced a lethal phenotype in one of her three children. 
4	Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker. 
3	Numb chin syndrome secondary to Burkitt's cell acute leukemia. We describe a case of Burkitt's cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with the bilateral numb chin syndrome as the initial symptom of the disease. Postmortem study of the trigeminal nerve showed heavy infiltrations of leukemic cells and destruction of axon and myelin by leukemic cells in the mandibular nerve. 
1	Mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma in diffuse epithelial ingrowth treated by block-excision. We treated a 40-year-old man with an acute, unilateral, open-angle glaucoma caused by a gelatinous translucent material in the anterior chamber. A clinical diagnosis of mucogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by diffuse epithelial ingrowth after ocular trauma one year earlier was suspected, but a primary or secondary ciliary body or iris neoplasm could not be ruled out. A curative 9-mm block-excision was performed. Six years later, intraocular pressure was normal, and the visual function was unchanged. Light and electron microscopy disclosed an island of diffuse columnar epithelium with numerous goblet cells on the iris surface and copious mucinous material extending into the trabecular mesh-work. 
1	Time to recurrence varies inversely with thickness in clinical stage 1 cutaneous melanoma. The thickness of a tumor has been identified as the principal prognostic factor in cutaneous malignant melanoma. However, time to recurrence has not conclusively been related to thickness. A retrospective study of 216 patients with a primary cutaneous malignant melanoma that recurred was conducted to clarify this relationship and investigate possible independent relationships between age at diagnosis and sex of patients to time to recurrence. The results of analysis of linear regression revealed an inverse linear relationship between thickness and time to recurrence (p less than 0.001). Patients more than 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis were shown to relapse sooner than those less than 50 years of age (p = 0.014). Sex was not a significant factor in predicting time to recurrence (p greater than 0.10). These results suggest that thickness of tumor provides an indication of time to recurrence in those patients destined to recur and stress the need for long term surveillance in patients with a history of malignant melanoma because of the possibility of late relapse even with thin lesions. 
1	Impaired production of tumor necrosis factor in breast cancer. Spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by peripheral blood macrophages was investigated in breast cancer. Whereas spontaneous TNF production by macrophages derived from patients with breast cancer was comparable with the one found in healthy controls (P greater than 0.1), LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from patients in the disease-free interval as well as with metastatic breast cancer were found to produce significantly lower amounts of TNF, as compared with macrophages derived from healthy control individuals (P less than 0.0005). However, the production of TNF did not significantly differ between the two patient populations (P greater than 0.05). The impairment of LPS-induced TNF production did not depend upon such characteristics of the primary tumor as size, axillary lymph node and estrogen receptor status, or upon the fact of administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and, in patients with metastatic disease, hormone treatment. To further investigate cytokine production by macrophages, spontaneous and LPS-induced interleukin-1 (IL-1) production was investigated also. However, no difference was found between patients and controls concerning IL-1 generation. The authors thus conclude that LPS-induced TNF production was impaired in breast cancer independent of the presence of detectable metastatic disease, whereas IL-1 production remained unimpaired. 
5	Desmopressin for diabetes insipidus, hemostatic disorders and enuresis. Arginine vasopressin preparations have been used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus for many years. Compared with older antidiuretic agents, the synthetic analog desmopressin is more potent, longer acting and easier to use. It is available for intravenous, subcutaneous and intranasal administration. Desmopressin may be useful in the treatment of hemostatic disorders such as von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia A. It has also been used for nocturnal enuresis. The vasopressor effects of arginine vasopressin preparations have been exploited for use as a temporizing measure in controlling acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Side effects such as hyponatremia and water intoxication are uncommon when these drugs are used with proper precautions. 
1	Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the ileum in an adult. We report a case of primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the ileum occurring in a 45-year-old man. The rhabdomyoblastic nature was immunohistochemically confirmed by positivity with anti-myoglobin and anti-striated actin antisera. We discuss the differential diagnosis with similar tumors. To our knowledge, ileal rhabdomyosarcomas have not been previously reported in adults. 
3	Total knee arthroplasty fixation. Comparison of the early results of paired cemented versus uncemented porous coated anatomic knee prostheses. The results of 18 matched pairs of Porous Coated Anatomic knee prostheses were studied to compare the early clinical and functional performance of cemented versus uncemented fixation with an average five-year follow-up period for both. The knee score improved from a preoperative average of 35 points to a postoperative average of 90 points in the cemented group, and from 38 points to 93 points in the uncemented group. In particular, the individual pain scores and the range-of-motion values were well matched at the three-, six-, and 12-month follow-up visits and showed a steady improvement. Subjectively, all patients were pleased with the results of surgery; one-third preferred the cemented side, one-third preferred the uncemented side, and one-third found no difference in the performance of either knee. The clinical and functional performance of knee prostheses in patients who had one cemented knee and one uncemented knee were comparable and possibly unrelated to the type of fixation method. 
5	Paraileostomy hernia: a clinical and radiological study. Forty-six patients who underwent colectomy with end ileostomy for ulcerative colitis (n = 33) or Crohn's disease (n = 13) have been reviewed for paraileostomy hernia (PIH) formation 1-16 years after surgery. PIH developed in 13 of these patients (28 per cent) and was not related to the original disease or excessive weight gain. Twenty-eight patients underwent limited computed tomography (CT) scanning of the stomal region. Eight of these had a clinically detectable PIH, which was demonstrated on CT. A further two patients had PIH demonstrated on CT which was not detected by clinical examination. The rate of PIH was similar where the stoma emerged lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle (six out of 16 patients, 37 per cent) to where the stoma emerged through the rectus (four out of 12 patients, 33 per cent). Recurrence following operative repair of PIH was common. PIH occurs more frequently than previously supposed. CT can detect PIH and may be useful in evaluating a patient with stoma-related symptoms for occult PIH formation. 
3	Attitudes of major employers toward the employment of people with epilepsy: a 30-year study. Beginning in 1956, major San Francisco Bay area employers were sampled at 10-year intervals for a 30-year period to assess attitudes toward the employment of epileptic workers. In this time, we documented a trend of sustained positive change that appears to validate the efforts of organizations that have focused on raising public awareness of this disorder. 
5	Isoperistaltic intestinal lengthening for short bowel syndrome. Because of improvements in supportive care, many infants now survive massive intestinal loss and have short bowel syndrome. Unfortunately, some survivors are left with an insufficient amount of intestine and cannot be weaned from total parenteral nutrition. An isoperistaltic intestinal lengthening procedure was used to treat surgically two such infants with 25 centimeters of remaining small intestine and absent ileocecal valves. This surgical technique longitudinally divides the short, dilated small intestine into two smaller, parallel lumens that are anastomosed end to end. This procedure preserves all mucosa, prolongs transit time by doubling intestinal length and corrects the ineffective peristalsis by tapering the dilated intestine. The lengthening technique can be performed because of the anatomic division of the intestinal vasculature within two leaves of the mesentery. Longitudinal division between the two leaves maintains vasculature to each side of the intestine. The isoperistaltic intestinal lengthening procedure, as it was successfully applied to two infants, is described in detail. 
4	Effect of intravenous streptokinase on the relation between initial ST-predicted size and final QRS-estimated size of acute myocardial infarcts. Thrombolytic therapy has been documented to reduce acute myocardial infarct size. The previously established relation between initial ST segment elevation and final electrocardiographic (ECG) myocardial infarct size in patients without coronary reperfusion might therefore be altered by thrombolytic therapy. The effect of intravenous streptokinase on this relation was therefore studied in 73 patients with initial acute myocardial infarction who had participated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2). Patients who received streptokinase were considered as one group and patients who did not receive streptokinase as a control group. Final myocardial infarct size, which was estimated from the QRS score, was predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation. In the 40 control patients there was no change from ST-predicted to final QRS-estimated infarct size (median 17.7% versus 18.3%; p = NS). In the 33 patients in the streptokinase group, there was a highly significant decrease from predicted to final myocardial infarct size (median 21.9% versus 16.2%; p less than 0.0002). This decrease was found for both anterior (median 23.7% versus 19.5%; p less than 0.03) and inferior (median 21.9% versus 12.0%; p = 0.001) infarct locations. Multiple regression analysis adjusting for differences in predicted infarct size confirmed the significance of streptokinase on the difference in infarct size (p = 0.006). Based on the variability of the percent change from predicted to final infarct size in the control group, a threshold decrease greater than or equal to 20% is required for identification of salvage. 
5	High ethanol consumption as risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage in young and middle-aged people. We examined the prevalence of high ethanol intake, hypertension, and other risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in a case-control study of 24 young and middle-aged patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We recorded ethanol consumption, history of hypertension, liver disease, cigarette smoking, and mild or severe coagulation disorder in each case of intracerebral hemorrhage and in 48 control patients matched by sex and age. In univariate matched analyses, the frequencies of high ethanol intake (p = 0.009), hypertension (p = 0.05), and coagulation disorder (p = 0.05) were higher in the cases than in the controls. After controlling for possible confounding factors, we found that high ethanol intake and hypertension were the only independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively). The hemorrhagic lesion found in cases with a high ethanol intake tended to be located in the cerebral lobes (p = 0.01), contrasting with the typical basal ganglia location of hypertensive hematomas (p = 0.009). We conclude that chronic, high ethanol intake should be considered as an important risk factor for lobar hematomas in young and middle-aged people. 
3	Musculoskeletal problems in association with cloacal exstrophy. The records of all thirteen patients for whom a diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy had been recorded in our hospitals were analyzed for evidence of musculoskeletal problems. All thirteen patients had spina bifida, four had congenital scoliosis, two had congenital kyphosis, and three had non-congenital scoliosis. All had a lipomeningocele, and eleven had paralysis of the lower extremities. Hydrocephalus and its associated problems were not found, but tethered-cord syndrome was diagnosed in eleven patients. Persistent diastasis of the symphysis pubis was found in all patients. Abduction and external rotation of the hips were more than normal. Mild dysplasia was seen in six of the twenty-six hips. Deformities of the foot were common, and twelve feet had been operated on for correction. Recurrent equinovarus deformity of the foot was associated with tethered-cord syndrome in two patients. 
4	Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. 
4	Intraoperative coronary excimer laser angioplasty: preliminary clinical experience. Diffuse coronary artery atherosclerosis is generally recognized as a deterrent to successful revascularization if it cannot be adequately treated. Mechanical endarterectomy can be useful, but it is not the optimal solution owing to the associated higher incidences of perioperative infarction and mortality. The use of laser energy as an endarterectomy tool appears promising. To investigate the application of excimer laser radiation to intraoperative coronary artery endarterectomy, 15 stenotic lesions in 13 patients were treated with excimer irradiation during coronary artery bypass grafting. Eleven (73%) of the lesions were enlarged by the excimer probe (6 of the successes were in calcified lesions). The 4 arteries not enlarged by the excimer laser all demonstrated calcified lesions. There were 3 perforations and 2 dissections, all but 1 in heavily calcified arteries. The results of this phase 1 safety and efficacy study indicate that excimer irradiation can recanalize most arteries, including total and subtotal occlusions and some calcified lesions. Further evaluation with better delivery systems is needed to determine whether the perforation rate can be reduced. 
5	Localised endosteal bone lysis in relation to the femoral components of cemented total hip arthroplasties. Four cases are described of localised endosteal bone lysis in the femur occurring in association with cemented femoral components that were not obviously 'loose' radiologically. In each, the area of lysis was shown at operation to be related directly to a region in which there was a local defect in the cement mantle surrounding the stem. Via the space between the stem and cement, such defects provide a route through which the contents of the joint cavity may reach the endosteal surface of the femur, subsequently leading to localised bone lysis, and later to frank loosening. 
2	Short-term course of corticosteroids in the treatment of resistant ascites complicating schistosomal liver disease. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of short-term corticosteroids in resistant ascites complicating schistosomal liver disease after 4 wk or more on standard treatment. Thirty-seven patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Group I (18 patients) was put on 40 mg furosemide and 200 mg spironolactone, in addition to a 15-day, tapering dose of prednisone (15, 10, 5 mg). Group II (19) patients received the same diuretics without steroids, and served as controls. At the end of a 2-wk course of therapy, the mean variations were as follows: body weight in patients in Group I ("cases") decreased by 9.8 kg, compared with 4.3 kg in controls; abdominal girth decreased by 7.4 cm in cases, compared with 3.6 cm in controls; urine output increased by 635.9 ml in cases, compared with 364.6 ml in controls; urinary sodium excretion increased by 16.5 mEq/day in cases, compared with 4.1 mEq/day in controls. These differences between cases and controls were found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, there were insignificant differences as regards decrease in blood urea (3.2 g/dl for cases and 2.7 g/dl for controls), decrease in serum creatinine (0.2 mg/dl for both cases and controls), increase in serum albumin (0.3 g/dl in cases and 0.2 g/dl in controls), increase in serum sodium (3.2 mEq/L in cases and 2.7 mEq/L in controls), and increase in serum potassium (0.2 mEq/L in cases and 0.4 mEq/L in controls). We conclude that a short-term course of corticosteroids in conjunction with standard diuretics has proved to be an effective, safe, and economical modality to relieve resistant hepatic ascites. It can be considered a temporary alternative to paracentesis with albumin infusion. 
5	Prediction of risk in noncardiac operations after cardiac operations. To determine the preoperative variables affecting the mortality rate and the development of severe complications in patients who have had myocardial revascularization or a valve replacement and who then undergo a noncardiac operation, we retrospectively studied data from 120 such patients over the 5 years from 1982 through 1986. Thirty-six percent of patients had a noncardiac operation during the first month after the cardiac operation. The mortality rate was 11%, and the morbidity rate was 56%. The statistical comparison of the predictive accuracy of postoperative complications of three simple, widely used classifications (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, New York Heart Association classification, Massachusetts General Hospital cardiac risk index) demonstrated the superiority of the simplified three-class cardiac risk index (Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index; predictive accuracy of 84%). In a multivariate discriminant analysis of 21 variables in this population, five variables (myocardial infarction in previous 6 months, S3 gallop or jugular vein distention, arrhythmia on last preoperative electrocardiogram, emergency operation, delay between cardiac and noncardiac operation) were identified as being the most predictive of a postoperative complication. When these variables were used in the function (DF3) obtained by linear discriminant analysis, the prediction accuracy of a postoperative complication reached 83%. Performance of the new models in a prospective validation population remained satisfactory (75% for Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index three-class index and 72% for DF3). Extensive statistical analysis of our data tested by a validation study provided simple predictive models based on clinical variables easily available even in emergency situations. 
1	Patterns of cervical lymph node metastasis from squamous carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. A consecutive series of 1,081 previously untreated patients undergoing 1,119 radical neck dissections (RNDs) for squamous carcinoma of the head and neck was reviewed to study the patterns of nodal metastases. Primary tumors were located in the oral cavity in 501 patients, in the oropharynx in 207 patients, in the hypopharynx in 126 patients, and in the larynx in 247 patients. Lymph node metastases were confirmed histologically in 82% of 776 therapeutic neck dissections, and micrometastases were discovered in 33% of 343 elective RNDs. Lymph node groups in the neck were described by levels (I to V). Predominance of certain levels was seen for each primary site. Levels I, II, and III were at highest risk for metastasis from cancer of the oral cavity, and levels II, III, and IV were at highest risk for metastasis from carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Supramohyoid neck dissection (clearing levels I, II, and III) for NO patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and anterolateral neck dissection (clearing levels II, III, and IV) for NO patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx are recommended. 
5	Laser placement in noncontact Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. We treated 40 eyes of 40 patients by using noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation to determine whether treatment 1.5 or 3.0 mm posterior to the corneoscleral lumbus was preferable. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. 
3	Effect of flumazenil on midazolam-induced amnesia. We have studied the effect of i.v. flumazenil 0.01 mg kg-1 on the amnesia and sedation caused by midazolam 2 mg and 5 mg i.v. in volunteers in order to determine the relationship between the actions of the antagonist on these two effects. Midazolam caused dose-dependent central neural depression as assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency, and dose-dependent amnesia for word cards. In subjects given flumazenil 5 min after administration of midazolam, fusion frequency readings and memory were restored to levels comparable to those before midazolam administration. These two effects of flumazenil were similar in time course and extent, suggesting that they share the same mechanism of action. Flumazenil given alone had no effect on memory. The study has demonstrated anterograde amnesia following benzodiazepine administration and antagonism by flumazenil. There was neither retrograde amnesia nor retrograde antagonism of amnesia. 
4	Presentation of breast carcinoma as Volkmann's contracture due to skeletal muscle metastases. Metastases to the skeletal muscles are extremely rare. They usually occur during the course of a pulmonary or digestive carcinoma. We describe a case of breast carcinoma presenting with forearm muscle metastases and Volkmann's type contracture. 
1	Diagnosing breast carcinoma in young women OBJECTIVE--To assess the individual and combined diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination, mammography, and fine needle aspiration biopsy in young women with breast cancer. DESIGN--Analysis based on case notes of patients presenting with breast cancer during 1971-89. SETTING--A combined breast clinic. PATIENTS--Consecutive series of 81 women aged less than 36 with histologically proved breast cancer presenting with a discrete mass over 19 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of clinical examination, xeromammography or conventional mammography, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and examination of tissue removed by surgery. RESULTS--The clinical diagnosis was correct in 47 women and radiography in 35. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was correct in 47 of the 63 women in whom it was successfully performed. Fine needle aspiration was significantly more accurate than mammography (78% v 45%, p less than 0.01). Ten (16%) patients had negative results on clinical examination, mammography, and fine needle aspiration. CONCLUSION--Mammography alone seems inadequately sensitive to detect breast cancer in young patients. When all investigations give negative results excision biopsy is the only way of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. 
1	The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation. 
5	Association between urinary symptoms at 7 years old and previous urinary tract infection. The association between current micturition habits and previous urinary tract infection was analysed among 3553 school entrants aged 7 years by means of a questionnaire. A high incidence of urinary infection, confirmed by urine culture, was found (145 (8.4%) in the 1719 girls and 32 (1.7%) in the 1834 boys). There was a significant association between current symptoms that were suggestive of disturbed bladder function and previous urinary tract infection, but only among girls who were over 3 years of age at the time the first episode was diagnosed. 
3	Optic nerve sheath meningoceles. Clinical and radiographic features in 13 cases with a review of the literature Thirteen patients with dilated intraorbital optic nerve sheaths with an expanded, patulous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space were studied with high-resolution computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Eleven patients had bilateral findings. Headache or visual complaints, or both, were present in all patients. Signs of optic nerve dysfunction were present in eight patients. Three patients had visual acuity worse than 20/200. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was mildly elevated in two patients. Three patients underwent a surgical procedure; visual acuity improved in one. The authors propose the term meningocele for this condition and suggest MRI with fat-suppression techniques and off-axis sagittal views as the radiographic procedure of choice. 
3	Antinociception and cardiovascular responses produced by electrical stimulation in the nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus reticularis ventralis, and the caudal medulla. In experiment 1, quantitative regional comparisons of the antinociceptive and cardiovascular responses produced by electrical stimulation in the caudal medulla, including regions such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), nucleus reticularis ventralis (NRV), nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRGC), nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NRPGC), nucleus raphe obscurus (NRO), and medial portions of the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), were made in the rat. Electrical stimulation in all of these regions resulted in inhibition of the nociceptive tail-flick reflex, although the threshold intensity for inhibition was greater for sites in NTS compared to many sites ventral to the NTS. Antinociception was generally accompanied by an increase in mean arterial blood pressure, with the exception of sites in the NRO, where depressor responses were evoked by stimulation. Detailed comparisons between the NTS and NRV revealed that greater intensities of electrical stimulation were required to produce antinociception for sites in the NTS as compared to the NRV. There were no significant differences in threshold intensities for antinociception as a function of rostrocaudal subdivisions of the NTS, but the lateral subdivision of the NTS was significantly more efficacious than the medial subdivision. This mediolateral difference within NTS was primarily due to stimulation in medial sites producing overt movements in some animals, probably due to stimulation of adjacent midline nuclei or pathways. Within the NRV, thresholds for inhibition of the tail-flick reflex were greater for sites in the dorsal subdivision as compared to the ventral subdivision, which contains spinopetal projections from the NRM. The slopes of the lines of recruitment for inhibition of the tail-flick reflex at stimulation sites in either the NTS or NRV were both very steep, similar to other forms of antinociception. In experiment 2, the pulse duration of electrical stimulation was varied for sites of stimulation in the lateral NTS and NRV to generate strength-duration curves. This experiment confirmed that stimulation sites in the lateral NTS required greater current intensities to inhibit the tail-flick reflex than sites in the NRV. However, the chronaxies derived from the strength-duration functions for the NTS or NRV were both approximately 170 microseconds, indicating that the antinociceptive effects in these regions may not be exclusively due to the stimulation of fibers of passage. These results are discussed in terms of the role of the NTS, NRV, and caudal medulla in the modulation of nociceptive responses and cardiovascular function. 
5	Tumor factors predicting for prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. The presence of P24 predicts for response to treatment and duration of survival. Fifty-one patients with metastatic breast cancer were investigated to determine tumor parameters with prognostic significance. Investigations included determinations of P24 content by immunocytochemical means using a monoclonal antibody to P24 protein; immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptors; ploidy analysis by flow cytometry, and histologic grading. There were significant correlations between the presence of P24 and estrogen receptor, between histologic grade and P24 expression, and between estrogen and progesterone receptors. Of the tumor factors investigated only P24 protein was, however, of prognostic significance. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly higher rate of response to treatment as well as more prolonged duration of response and duration of survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. None of the other variables investigated were significantly predictive of outcome. P24 protein may be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. 
1	An epithelial cyst in the cerebellopontine angle. Case report. A case of a benign epithelial cyst in the posterior cranial fossa is described. It had the unique histological feature of a double-layered cuboidal epithelial lining. Detailed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies supported an endodermal origin. The differential diagnosis and the histogenesis of epithelial cysts in the central nervous system are discussed. 
1	Recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus. A benign lesion, not to be mistaken for malignant melanoma. Melanocytic nevi that recur after incomplete removal are pigmented lesions that may clinically and pathologically simulate malignant melanoma in situ. Five examples of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus, with emphasis on light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, are reported herein. Prominent HMB-45 staining in these nevi may cause further confusion in differentiating them from malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevi is discussed, with particular emphasis on distinguishing these lesions from malignant melanoma. Our immunohistochemical observations indicate that the recurrences most likely develop as a result of proliferation of melanocytes remaining in the epidermis and/or adnexae following incomplete removal. The approach and management of recurrent nevi are also discussed. 
5	Overestimation of myocardial infarct size by histologic measurement in a model of occlusion followed by reperfusion. We studied 32 transverse left ventricular slices of myocardium from 16 pigs after 45 to 100 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by 180 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct area for each slice was determined as follows: (1) grossly, by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining of each slice, and (2) microscopically, by complete histologic sectioning of the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained surface of each slice. Planimetry of necrotic and nonnecrotic areas was performed from tracings and photographs of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained slices and from actual histologic sections. When triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and histologic measurements were compared, necrotic tissue area had decreased 11.4% +/- 15.0% (2.59 +/- 1.04 vs 2.09 +/- 0.86 cm2). Nonnecrotic tissue area decreased 20.6% +/- 24.0% (8.31 +/- 3.79 vs 5.16 +/- 2.73 cm2). In this model of ischemia followed by reperfusion, with fixation and processing, viable tissue shrank almost twice as much as necrotic tissue. This differential shrinkage introduces an error resulting in overestimation of infarct size by histologic quantitation. 
5	Resting metabolic rate and energy balance in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic runners. This study investigated metabolic and nutritional factors in association with athletic menstrual dysfunction (AMD). Three groups of women were studied: amenorrheic runners (amenorrheic), eumenorrheic runners (eumenorrheic), and eumenorrheic sedentary controls (sedentary). Amenorrheic and eumenorrheic were similar in age, weight, percent body fat by hydrodensitometry, training pace and mileage, best 10 km race time, years running, and maximal oxygen consumption. When adjusted for body weight or for fat-free mass by analysis of covariance, RMR was significantly lower in amenorrheic than in eumenorrheic and sedentary. The daily caloric intakes of the groups did not differ significantly, but the amenorrheic scored significantly higher than the eumenorrheic and sedentary on a scale of aberrant eating patterns. Amenorrheic high mileage runners seem to have a less adequate diet than eumenorrheic runners but appear to maintain energy balance and stable weight through a reduction in RMR. 
3	Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of two novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, in the kindling model of epilepsy. Comparison with MK-801 and carbamazepine. The orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists CGP 37849 (DL-[E]-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid) and its ethyl ester CGP 39551 were evaluated in amygdala-kindled rats, a model for complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of these novel compounds were compared with those of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imin e] and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, one of the major drugs for treatment of partial and generalized seizures in humans. For comparative evaluation, the compounds were injected i.p. at the following doses: 1 to 10 mg/kg (CGP 37849 or CGP 39551), 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (MK-801) and 20 to 40 mg/kg (carbamazepine), respectively. In contrast to carbamazepine, CGP 37849, CGP 39551 and MK-801 exerted only weak anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats and did not increase the focal seizure threshold. The weak anticonvulsant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats were associated with profound untoward behavioral effects. The behavioral syndrome induced by the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats was characterized by marked ataxia, hyperactivity and, in case of CGP 37849 and MK-801, stereotypies, such as head weaving. The low or absent effectiveness of the novel NMDA receptor antagonists against kindled seizures suggests that these compounds will not be clinically useful antiepileptics against partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Furthermore, in view of the recent clinical findings on psychotomimetic effects of MK-801 in epileptic patients, the similarities in the excitatory effects produced by CGP 39551, CGP 37849 and MK-801 in kindled rats may indicate that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may also produce psychotomimetic effects in humans. 
5	Treatment of traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta. A 15-year experience. Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta is increasing in incidence and remains a highly lethal injury. The morbidity associated with this injury also remains high. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients admitted to our emergency department with ruptured thoracic aortas during a 15-year period to determine the reason for this persistently high morbidity and mortality and to identify any factors that might improve the outcome. We found that patients who are in unstable condition on arrival in the emergency department or who become unstable before reaching the operating room are not likely to survive. Patients who are injured in automobile accidents have a greater chance of survival than do those injured in motorcycle accidents or car-pedestrian accidents. Patients who are in hemodynamically stable condition after aortic injury survive only if diagnosis and treatment are prompt. Major complications of repair following thoracic aortic injury relate primarily to the length of cross-clamp time, and every effort should be devoted to keeping the cross-clamp time less than 30 minutes. 
4	Increased ischemic injury but decreased hypoxic injury in hypertrophied rat hearts. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of ischemic and hypoxic injury in normal versus hypertrophied rat hearts to investigate basic mechanisms responsible for irreversible myocardial ischemic injury. Hearts from rats with bands placed on the aortic arch at 23 days of age (BAND) and sham-operated rats (SHAM, 8 weeks postoperative) were isolated, perfused with Krebs buffer, and had a left ventricular balloon to measure developed pressure. Hearts were made globally ischemic until they developed peak ischemic contracture and were reperfused for 30 minutes. Additional hearts were perfused for 15 minutes with glucose-free hypoxic buffer followed by 20 minutes of oxygenated perfusion. There was an 87% increase in heart weight of BAND compared with SHAM (p less than 0.01). During ischemia, lactate levels increased faster in BAND compared with SHAM, ischemic contracture occurred earlier in BAND than in SHAM despite no difference in ATP levels, and postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure was less in BAND (26.8 +/- 5.6% of control left ventricular pressure, mean +/- SEM) compared with SHAM (40 +/- 4.6%, p less than 0.05). During hypoxic perfusion, lactate release was greater in BAND than in SHAM (48.8 +/- 1.2 versus 26.6 +/- 0.97 mumols/g, p less than 0.01), and with reoxygenation, lactate dehydrogenase release was less in BAND than in SHAM (13.2 +/- 0.7 versus 19.5 +/- 0.2 IU/g, p less than 0.01). After hypoxia and reoxygenation, left ventricular pressure recovery was greater in BAND than in SHAM (93 +/- 8.4% versus 66 +/- 5.3%, p less than 0.01). Thus, this study suggests that hypertrophied hearts have a greater potential for glycolytic metabolism, resulting in an increased rate of by-product accumulation during ischemia, which may be responsible for the increased susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to ischemic injury. 
5	Channel specificity in antiarrhythmic drug action. Mechanism of potassium channel block and its role in suppressing and aggravating cardiac arrhythmias. Although work on class III antiarrhythmics remains at an early stage, these agents still appear to possess greater efficacy and less proarrhythmia than conventional class I agents in those experimental arrhythmia models considered to be most representative of the clinical situation. Although prolongation of repolarization carries with its own tendency for pause-dependent arrhythmogenesis (i.e., torsade de pointes), available data suggest that this may be a function of nonspecificity in potassium channel block rather than a general characteristic of class III activity. The availability of new and more selective blockers of specific cardiac potassium channels under development as class III agents have already helped to clarify basic questions about the ionic mechanism of repolarization in the heart, and one hopes that a growing clinical data base will eventually determine the relative safety and efficacy of these agents in preventing symptomatic and life-threatening arrhythmias. 
5	Physical and psychosocial consequences of total laryngectomy. The incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy and their influence on daily living were studied in 59 laryngectomized patients. Daily sputum production was the principal complaint of these patients (98%), followed by coughing (64%) and the need for frequent forced expectoration (more than 5 times a day) in order to clear the airway (57%). Frequent stoma cleaning (more than 5 times a day) was required by 37% of the patients. Significant correlation was found between respiratory symptoms, voice rehabilitation and several aspects of daily living, including fatigue, sleep problems, social contacts and psychological distress. These findings indicate that respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy are both frequent and troublesome. The development of effective methods for minimizing and/or preventing such respiratory problems would contribute significantly to improving the quality of life of laryngectomized patients. 
1	Pheochromocytoma with electrocardiographic change mimicking angina pectoris, and cyclic change in direct arterial pressure--a case report. A forty-two-year-old man was admitted because of chest pain. Electrocardiograms at admission showed horizontal ST depression in leads, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, and V6. Direct blood pressure monitoring revealed cyclic change between 160/100 mmHg and 70/50 mmHg and heart rate between 80/sec and 120/sec at fifteen minute intervals. The plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were elevated during the episodes of hypertension. Pheochromocytoma was found in the right adrenal gland. These cyclic changes in blood pressure and heart rate are an aid for diagnosis. 
3	Postlaminectomy ossified extradural pseudocyst. Case report. A large ossified spurious meningocele accompanied by recurrent lumbar disc herniation occurred 7 years after posterior intervention for laminectomy and discectomy in a 53-year-old man. The cyst wall, histologically composed of mature bone tissue, was sparsely covered with connective tissue and lined with fibrocyte- or fibroblast-like cells on the inside. The ossified pseudocyst was presumed to have originated from a minute defect in the dura mater which occurred at the time of the first operation. 
5	Electroencephalographic changes during brief cardiac arrest in humans. Slowing and attenuation of the dominant frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are changes commonly used to detect cerebral ischemia. To assess the validity of this method, the EEGs recorded during 93 episodes of circulatory arrest in ten normothermic, lightly anesthetized patients undergoing implantation of automatic internal cardioverting defibrillators (AICDs) were visually inspected for change. The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies. These alternative patterns should be recognized as indicative of cerebral ischemia when intraoperative EEG monitoring is performed. 
1	The role of the immunogenetics laboratory in marrow transplantation. Allogeneic marrow transplants from genotypically HLA-identical siblings have become lifesaving therapy for patients with various congenital and acquired diseases of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Unfortunately, less than 30% of patients in the United States have an HLA-identical sibling; therefore, many are denied the opportunity for potentially curative treatment for otherwise fatal conditions. The results of marrow transplantation from haploidentical family members who were partially compatible for nonshared haplotypes with the patients demonstrated the relevance of HLA compatibility for engraftment and graft-vs-host disease. These results have provided the rationale for using HLA-identical unrelated volunteers as marrow donors. The recent development of a national registry of volunteer bone marrow donors (the National Marrow Donor Program in the United States) has made it possible to access a centralized file of more than 260,000 HLA-typed volunteers. Marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have become feasible. However, our preliminary clinical experience clearly demonstrated an increase in the incidence and severity of graft-vs-host disease. It is likely that standard HLA typing techniques are not adequate to provide data for sufficient donor and recipient matching. It is possible that currently available molecular technology could be applied to HLA typing and donor matching to improve on clinical results. 
4	Severe cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis developing during pregnancy in a case of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a fatal case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developing cerebral and systemic necrotizing vasculitis during pregnancy. The patient was discovered to have SLE at 14 weeks' gestation. Although the symptoms disappeared without treatment with corticosteroid in the 2nd trimester, she presented with meningoencephalitis due to vasculitis in the 3rd trimester. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE. 
5	Hamman-Rich syndrome revisited In this article, we retrospectively review 29 cases of Hamman-Rich syndrome. As in some other recent reports, we have used the term "acute interstitial pneumonia" to emphasize the clinical and pathologic features of these cases and to distinguish them from the more common chronic interstitial pneumonias, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Of the 29 patients, 12 survived, some after a long and complicated hospitalization. The histologic features were those of organizing diffuse alveolar damage, and some patients, including survivors, had extensive fibroblastic distortion of lung parenchyma. The overall survival among these patients was not appreciably different from the survival of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome in general. 
5	Diagnosis of Lyme disease based on dermatologic manifestations. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is most commonly transmitted to humans by a tick bite. Characterized by early and late phases, Lyme disease is a multisystem illness involving the skin, heart, joints, and nervous system. Diagnosis is based predominantly on clinical manifestations, the most specific being dermatologic. Thus, recognizing the dermatologic manifestations of Lyme disease is important for diagnosis and institution of appropriate, effective therapy. Approximately 75% of patients with Lyme disease present with the pathognomonic skin lesion erythema migrans, an expanding erythematous lesion. During early infection, secondary erythema migrans lesions or Borrelia lymphocytoma may occur. Borrelia lymphocytoma commonly presents as an erythematous nodule on the ear lobe or nipple. During late infection, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, an erythematous, atrophic plaque unique to Lyme disease may appear; it has been described in about 10% of patients with Lyme disease in Europe. Fibrotic nodules associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans as well as other sclerotic and atrophic lesions, such as morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, anetoderma, and atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini, have been seen late in the course of Lyme disease. In a few cases, other sclerodermatous lesions, such as eosinophilic fasciitis and progressive facial hemiatrophy, have been linked to B. burgdorferi infection. We review the cutaneous lesions associated with Lyme disease. 
1	Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and HIV infection. We retrospectively reviewed six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated between 1985 and 1988. All six patients were homosexual men. Five patients had AIDS and one was HIV-positive. The most common symptoms and signs were pain (n = 5), mass (n = 5), and bleeding (n = 5). The average tumor size was 3.2 cm with a range of 1-10 cm. Five tumors were located in the anal canal and one at the anodermal junction. One patient was treated with biopsy alone, one with local excision, one with wide local excision and radiation therapy, and two with diverting colostomy. The average follow-up was 8 months. Of the five AIDS patients, two died, one was transferred to a hospice facility, one was lost to follow-up, and one remains alive 1 year following treatment. The HIV-positive patient died secondary to metastatic SCCA. This group of patients raises the question of a possible association between HIV and SCCA. 
5	Acute dissection of the internal mammary artery: a fatal complication of coronary artery bypass grafting. A case of acute traumatic dissection of the right internal mammary artery is presented in a patient who had both IMAs grafted for recurrent angina 10 years after initial vein coronary revascularisation. The event was mistaken for spasm, but because of severe circulatory collapse no time was available to treat the patient appropriately. The purpose of this report is to facilitate the early recognition and avoidance of this potentially fatal complication. 
3	Prevention of cardiovascular disease: risks and benefits of aspirin. Aspirin has been tested for its benefit in preventing cardiovascular disease in randomized trials in three categories of patients. In secondary prevention among those with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient cerebral ischemia, or unstable angina pectoris, 25 randomized trials demonstrated significant reductions from aspirin of 25% for the occurrence of an "important vascular event" (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death), 32% for nonfatal MI, 27% for nonfatal stroke, and 15% for vascular mortality. Among those evolving an MI, the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) showed a significant reduction of 23% in five-week vascular mortality among those started on a one-month regimen of daily aspirin within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of suspected MI. Aspirin also significantly reduced reinfarction, nonfatal stroke, and important vascular events. Finally, in primary prevention, the US Physicians' Health Study (PHS) showed a significant 44% reduction in the occurrence of a first MI among apparently healthy male physicians; numbers of strokes and vascular deaths were insufficient to permit conclusions for these endpoints. Thus, aspirin is of clear benefit in reducing MI, stroke, and vascular death in secondary prevention and among those evolving an MI. It is also beneficial in the primary prevention of MI among men over 40, but data concerning its effects on stroke and vascular death remain inconclusive. 
1	Effect of bleomycin on hematoporphyrin derivative phototherapy of solid tumors. Hematoporphyrin derivative phototherapy (HpD-PT) has been successfully used to localize and treat superficial squamous cell cancers. Bleomycin sulfate is a glycopeptide antibiotic that has antineoplastic properties against squamous cell cancers. Because both HpD-PT and bleomycin chemotherapy are accepted forms of treatment for squamous cell cancer and their cytotoxicity is mediated by singlet oxygen and oxygen radicals, we studied the possibility of enhancing the response of solid tumors to HpD-PT by combining this modality with systemic bleomycin chemotherapy in a murine tumor model. Bleomycin did not enhance HpD-PT significantly. Also, we are not confident that HpD-PT alone or in combination with other agents can eradicate solid tumors; it certainly did not in this syngeneic murine tumor model. 
5	Control of hypertensive emergencies Although uncommon, hypertensive emergencies require prompt recognition and treatment to reduce very high morbidity and mortality rates. Admission to an intensive care unit for treatment and monitoring is essential for optimal care. A Swan-Ganz catheter is often helpful in management. Intravenous nitroprusside sodium (Nipride, Nitropress) is probably the drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies other than those due to eclampsia or pheochromocytoma. 
1	Risk of gastric cancer after gastric surgery for benign disorders. The objective of this review was to evaluate published evidence for the association between gastric resection for benign disorders and subsequent cancer of the gastric remnant. We searched the literature through Medline (1970 to 1988) and through the references of relevant articles. Fifty-eight studies consisting of case series, uncontrolled surveys, and case control or cohort analyses were identified and critically assessed using defined methodological criteria. There were no consistent differences between the expected and observed number of cancers occurring within 15 years after gastric resection. However, all case control studies and seven of the eight cohort analyses, in which the prevalence of cancer was stratified by time since gastric resection, indicated a twofold to fourfold increase in the risk of gastric cancer in patients who survived 15 or more years after gastric surgery. We conclude that most studies of the association of gastric surgery with subsequent gastric cancer have relatively weak designs. Still, the repetitive demonstration of this association by different investigators using different research designs supports the hypothesis that gastric resection increases the risk of cancer in the gastric remnant. 
5	Renal secretion and hepatic clearance of human multiple renin forms. Human active renin can be separated into at least five forms by isoelectric focusing. The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity. 
5	Selected measures of health status for Mexican-American, mainland Puerto Rican, and Cuban-American children. The 1987 National Vital Statistics System and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1982 through 1984) were used to assess the health status of Mexican-American, mainland Puerto Rican, and Cuban-American children by examining the prevalences of pregnancy outcomes and chronic medical conditions. The low-birth-weight rate among Hispanics (7.0%) compared favorably with that of non-Hispanic whites (7.1%) despite the greater poverty and lower levels of education among Hispanics. When examined by Hispanic subgroup, however, significant differences were present, with mainland Puerto Ricans having the highest prevalences of low-birth-weight infants. Premature births were more common among all three Hispanic subgroups than among non-Hispanic whites. Mexican-American and Cuban-American children had a similar prevalence of (3.9% and 2.5%, respectively) chronic medical conditions compared with non-Hispanic white children; Puerto Rican children had a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions (6.2%). When assessed by these health status indicators, Hispanic children seem to have a health status similar to non-Hispanic white children. However, mainland Puerto Rican children seem at greater risk for poor health, reflecting the US Hispanic population's heterogeneity. Health programs targeted at US Hispanics should appropriately consider these group differences. 
5	Hippocampal sclerosis can be reliably detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Two independent blinded observers reported the preoperative MRIs in a series of 81 consecutive patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy who were undergoing temporal lobectomy. We then compared the nature and lateralization of the MRI abnormalities with the pathologic diagnosis and the side of lobectomy. The MRI criteria of hippocampal sclerosis were an increased T2-weighted signal and the signal's confinement to a unilaterally small hippocampus. Imaging was performed in coronal and axial planes, specially orientated along and perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampal body. We found diagnostic MRI abnormalities in 25 of the 27 cases with pathologically proven hippocampal sclerosis (sensitivity 93%, specificity 86%). In addition, we detected all 13 foreign tissue lesions on MRI. Overall, we detected lateralized lesions on MRI that correctly predicted the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe in 72 cases (89%), with 2 possible errors. A learning effect in appreciating the relatively subtle MRI changes of hippocampal sclerosis was apparent in our later cases, as shown by an improved correlation between the 2 observers. This study demonstrates that hippocampal sclerosis can be identified on MRI with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. 
5	Selective evaluation and management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A 16-year experience. Reduction of cardiac mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair remains an important goal. Five hundred consecutive urgent or elective operations for infrarenal nonruptured AAA were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative cardiac status: group I (n = 260, 52%), no clinical or electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD); group II (n = 212, 42.2%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered stable after further evaluation with studies such as dipyridamole-thallium scanning, echocardiography, or coronary arteriography; group III (n = 28, 5.6%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered unstable after further evaluation. Group I had no further cardiac evaluation and groups I and II underwent AAA repair without invasive treatment of CAD. Group III underwent repair of cardiac disease before (n = 21) or coincident with (n = 7) AAA repair. In all instances, perioperative fluid volume management was based on left ventricular performance curves constructed before operation. The 30-day operative mortality rate for AAA repair in all 500 patients was 1.6% (n = 8). There was one (0.4%) cardiac-related operative death in group I, which was significantly less than the five (2.4%) in group II (p less than 0.02). Total mortality for the two groups were also significantly different, with one group I death (0.4%) and seven group II deaths (3.3%), (p less than 0.02). These data support the conclusions that (1) the leading cause of perioperative mortality in AAA repair is myocardial infarction, (2) correction of severe or unstable CAD before or coincident with AAA repair is effective in preventing operative mortality, (3) patients with known CAD should be investigated more thoroughly to identify those likely to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia so that their CAD can be corrected before AAA repair, and (4) patients with no clinical or ECG evidence of CAD rarely die of perioperative myocardial infarction, and thus selective evaluation of CAD based on clinical grounds in AAA patients is justified. 
1	Osteoblastoma of the spine. A review of 75 cases. Clinical and radiologic features of 75 cases of osteoblastoma of the spine were reviewed. In addition to pain, which was the most frequent complaint, 18 patients demonstrated objective neurologic deficit, while scoliosis was observed in 17 patients. Aspirin yielded pain relief in 13 patients. Pathologic fracture was not encountered. The radiologic and histologic characteristics of osteoblastoma of the spine are indistinguishable from those arising in other sites. The typical lesion exhibited a well-defined, geographic margin with a sclerotic, frequently lobulated border. Approximately one half of the cases were predominantly lucent, the remainder displaying varying degrees of matrix mineralization. Distribution of the osteoblastomas through the spinal axis was as follows: cervical-29, thoracic-16, lumbar-17, sacral-13. Other significant findings included posterior element involvement in 73 of 75 cases, and a striking male to female ratio of 2.5 to 1. 
4	Transcardiac release of leukotriene C4 by neutrophils in patients with coronary artery disease. Leukotriene C4 is a potent constrictor of smooth muscle in vitro and may induce coronary vasoconstriction in vivo. To study leukotriene C4 release by neutrophils in patients with coronary artery disease, neutrophils were separated from blood samples taken from the coronary sinus and aorta in 20 patients with stable exertional angina and angiographically documented coronary artery narrowings (group I). Eight patients with normal coronary arteries were also studied (group II). To assess leukotriene C4 generation, neutrophils were incubated with calcium ionophore A 23187 (0.25 microM) and the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were analyzed for leukotriene C4 by radioimmunoassay. Patients in group I had a significantly lower release of leukotriene C4 from neutrophils separated from the coronary sinus blood than from those separated from aortic blood (4.33 +/- 0.69 versus 5.92 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, p less than 0.025), whereas patients in group II had a similar release of leukotriene C4 by the neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood and from aortic blood (6.0 +/- 0.72 versus 6.4 +/- 0.66 ng/ml, p = NS). Moreover, in group I patients, a significant correlation was found (p less than 0.01) between the extent of coronary artery disease (expressed by the Leaman coronary score) and the percent reduction in leukotriene C4 released from neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood as compared with leukotriene C4 produced by neutrophils separated from aortic blood. These data show that neutrophils from patients with coronary artery disease have a reduced ability to produce leukotriene C4 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A 23187. 
3	Widespread functional effects of discrete thalamic infarction. In order to investigate functional effects of various thalamic structures on metabolism in remote, morphologically intact cerebral regions, we used positron emission tomography of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to study regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRGlu) in 11 patients with chronic unilateral or bilateral infarcts strictly confined to the thalamus. Patients were grouped according to computed tomographic scans showing anterior (three), medial (four), or posterior (four) lesions. Compared with a matched group of 11 healthy subjects (hemispheric CMRGlu 35.2 +/- 3.49 mumol/100 g per minute), glucose metabolism was significantly lower in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarction (31.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Patients with bilateral infarcts had lower hemispheric CMRGlu (29.9 +/- 2.74 mumol/100 g per minute) than those with unilateral lesions (32.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Depending on infarct location within the thalamus, there was differential depression of rCMRGlu, with the largest effects on frontal and occipital areas in medial infarctions. Except for ipsilateral thalamic deactivation, metabolic patterns with anterior thalamic infarcts were close to normal, while posterior infarcts mostly depressed rCMRGlu in the visual and in the inferior limbic cortex. Cerebellar metabolic rates were within normal limits in most cases. These patterns of regional cerebral deactivation may be related to categories of thalamic projections--intrathalamic, to limbic system and basal ganglia, diffuse to most cortical areas, and specific to defined neocortical areas. Even small brain lesions may have widespread functional sequelae, potentially demonstrable by positron emission tomography. 
2	A five-year U.S. Army experience with 36,250 abdominal hernia repairs. Thirty-six thousand two hundred fifty abdominal hernia repairs were performed in U.S. Army medical treatment facilities during a five-year period. This study presents data about the type of hernia, incidence of complications by obstruction or strangulation, age, sex, and mortality. Hernias occurring with intestinal obstruction or gangrene (strangulation) are referred to as complicated hernias. Inguinal hernias in children less than two years of age, femoral hernias, and unusual (such as internal or obturator) hernias were found to have an increased incidence of complications. Surgical repair of ventral, umbilical, and femoral hernias was done with a low surgical risk and the presence of complications did not significantly increase this risk. An increased risk of mortality is associated with the repair of complicated unusual hernias and complicated inguinal hernias in patients more than 60 years of age. 
3	Sequencing in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in programming and controlling movement. Central programming deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied in two reaction time (RT) experiments. In Experiment 1, PD patients and controls performed sequences of hand postures that varied in length, the number of different postures (repetitive vs heterogeneous), and the delay interval before movement. Before movement, the PD group planned repetitive movements like controls whereas for heterogeneous sequences RT increased less with sequence length for the PD group, implying less preprogramming. The interresponse time (IRT) data from repetitive sequences showed that the PD group had difficulty controlling movement such that IRTs were faster when sequences were longer, thus allowing more time to schedule the termination of the sequence during the course of movement. For heterogeneous sequences, the PD group made more errors and were slower than controls when changing hand postures, suggesting a deficit in switching between different responses. While RT decreased with a longer delay similarly for both groups, IRT1 continued to improve only for the PD group but similarly for both types of sequences, suggesting a deficit specific to programming the first response. In Experiment 2, subjects made decisions about the number of different hand postures contained within a sequence. PD patients' decision times improved more with a longer delay only for heterogeneous sequences, suggesting a problem in identifying the number of different hand postures. The results have implications for levels of motor dysfunction in PD which emphasize the influence of sequence length and complexity. 
3	Motor-evoked potentials reflect spinal cord function in post-traumatic syringomyelia. The purpose of this study was to examine electrophysiologic abnormalities, including motor-evoked potentials, in a patient with post-traumatic syringomyelia before and after syringopleural shunting. A patient with C5 quadriplegia presented with pain, ascending sensory loss, and new weakness in the left upper extremity two yr after spinal cord injury. MRI revealed a syrinx extending from C2 to T12. We measured central motor conduction times (CMCTs) to the biceps, median F-wave latencies, needle electromyography and motor nerve conduction studies. Six days before surgery, CMCTs were 9.0 ms on the left and 7.8 ms on the right (normal less than 8.0), median F-waves were absent on the left and needle EMG revealed evidence of denervation in the left biceps. Fifteen days after syringopleural shunting at the T7 level, CMCTs had dropped to 6.9 ms on the left and 4.6 ms on the right; the left median F-wave reappeared with a normal latency. Repeat MRI revealed the syrinx to be smaller in diameter. These results suggest that CMCTs measured from magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex may be useful in the diagnosis of post-traumatic syringomyelia, as well as for following such patients postoperatively. 
2	Hepatocyte transplantation into the lung for treatment of acute hepatic failure in the rat. The lung was investigated as a matrix for transplanted hepatocytes in the rat model. Surgically induced fulminant hepatic failure was successfully treated by injection of 5 to 7 x 10(7) isolated hepatocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma in 86% of the animals. No animal, however, survived injection of hepatocytes into the jugular vein. It was found that liver failure is a prerequisite for the intrapulmonary survival of hepatocytes. After regeneration of the native liver, the majority of hepatocytes are cleared away within 6 months. 
3	The neuromuscular pathology of the Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome. The Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) is a recently reorganized disorder in patients ingesting pharmacologic doses of L-tryptophan. We studied the lesions of skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve and skin in 12 cases of EMS. Perimyositis was severe in four, moderate in two, mild in three and absent in three cases. The lesions contained many eosinophils, T-helper cells, mast cells and activated macrophages. Type 2 myofiber atrophy was present in five cases and in one, this was the only pathologic finding. Severe epineurial inflammation was seen in the three sural nerve biopsies. Indirect evidence for peripheral neurologic involvement in three other cases consisted of inflammation surrounding intramuscular nerve twigs (two cases) and neurogenic atrophy (one case). Phlebitis accompanied the connective tissue inflammation in five cases and endarteritis in one. Fasciitis was present in three of four skin biopsies and dermal fibrosis in one. 
5	Occlusion of an "accessory" distal anterior cerebral artery during treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Report of two cases. Two cases are presented in which clip occlusion of a third distal anterior cerebral artery segment occurred during treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Case histories, angiograms, operative descriptions, and postmortem findings are presented. The incidence of this anomalous vessel is reviewed. Preoperative and intraoperative vigilance in determining the presence of this anomaly prior to clip placement is emphasized. 
5	Propafenone treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in patients tolerating oral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that propafenone, administered orally, prevents symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: a 6-month, open-label, dose-finding phase followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase, with each treatment period lasting up to 60 days. SETTING: An outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients with either paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 16) or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 17) were enrolled. Their arrhythmias were documented by electrocardiogram before enrollment. Twenty-three patients (14 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 9 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) were randomized and the data obtained from these patients were used in the efficacy analysis. INTERVENTION: Propafenone (300 mg three times daily in 19 patients, 300 mg twice daily in 3 patients, and 150 mg twice daily in 1 patient) and matching placebo tablets were administered in a randomized sequence. MEASUREMENTS: Symptomatic arrhythmia was documented by telephone transmission of the electrocardiogram. MAIN RESULTS: The time to first recurrence was prolonged for the overall group of 23 patients while they received propafenone (P = 0.004). The recurrence rate of arrhythmia during treatment with propafenone was estimated to be approximately one fifth of the recurrence rate during treatment with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Propafenone is effective in reducing symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. 
5	Total perinatal wastage. A clarification of priorities. The pregnancy outcome of 16,971 women carrying 17,352 living fetuses after 16 weeks gestation was studied. As well as recording perinatal deaths, all losses before 28 weeks and up to one year after delivery were recorded to give a total perinatal wastage rate of 21.6 per 1000 fetuses alive at 16 weeks compared with a perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths plus early neonatal deaths) of 7.8 per 1000 births. All deaths were then classified according to pathological sub-groups. The concept of auditing perinatal care using perinatal mortality was then compared with that using total perinatal wastage. 
2	Surgical management of islet cell dysmaturation syndrome in young children. Islet cell dysmaturation syndrome (ICDS) encompasses the causes of infantile hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia histologically described as islet cell hyperplasia, pancreatic adenomatosis and nesidioblastosis. Eleven infants underwent 14 pancreatic resections for ICDS from 1965 to 1990 at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center for severe hypoglycemia unresponsive to medical therapy. Seizures were the presenting symptoms of hypoglycemia in eight infants. Six patients had nesidioblastosis, four had islet cell hyperplasia and one patient had an adenoma with histologically normal pancreatic islet cells. Four neonates underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection; three with nesidioblastosis required reoperation (90 to 95 per cent resection). Four older infants underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection but required diazoxide for less than six months postoperatively. Three infants underwent 90 to 95 per cent pancreatic resection. None have required reoperation or postoperative medications. All infants are normoglycemic without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and none had postoperative complications. Five infants had preoperative neurologic impairment, with three having severe retardation; all showed some improvement postoperatively, but only one infant now has normal findings on neurologic examination. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical resection should minimize neurologic complications of the ICDS. 
3	Multimodality evoked potential testing in acute mild closed head injury. Multimodality evoked potential (MEP) testing, including brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials, have been reported to be useful in predicting outcome in severe closed head injury. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials have been demonstrated to be abnormal in 10% to 40% of acute mild head injury. A prospective study of 18 patients with mild closed head injury was undertaken to determine the usefulness of MEP screening within two weeks of the acute event. Long latency event-related potentials (P300s), in response to auditory stimuli with an oddball paradigm, were included in the screening. The subjects had several symptoms consistent with the postconcussive syndrome at the time of the evoked potential testing. Only one patient had an abnormal evoked potential response (greater than three standard deviations from the mean) from all the testing done. The standard methods of MEP testing were insensitive to quantifying the possible physiologic changes that are associated with memory deficits, lethargy, and emotional irritability after mild closed head injury. 
4	Increased endothelin in experimental heart failure. Recent studies demonstrate that endothelin, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor peptide, circulates in plasma of normal animals and humans. However, the role of this peptide in pathophysiological states remains unclear. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that circulating endothelin concentrations are increased in experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), a pathophysiological state characterized by activation of vasoconstrictor mechanisms. In anesthetized dogs with CHF produced by 8 days of rapid ventricular pacing (n = 28), circulating plasma endothelin was increased compared with values for normal controls (n = 28; 20.4 +/- 1.4 versus 9.7 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, respectively; p less than 0.0001). A plasma endothelin level of more than 14.0 was a sensitive and specific indicator of significant CHF. Moreover, within the group with experimental CHF, right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated independently with circulating endothelin levels. Based on recent studies demonstrating the physiological actions of twofold increases in circulating endothelin, as observed in the present study, a possible role for endothelin in the pathophysiology of CHF is advanced. 
5	Selective G to T mutations of p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma from southern Africa Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia. Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins are risk factors for HCC, but the molecular mechanism of human hepatocellular carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Abnormalities in the structure and expression of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 are frequent in HCC cell lines, and allelic losses from chromosome 17p have been found in HCCs from China and Japan. Here we report on allelic deletions from chromosome 17p and mutations of the p53 gene found in 50% of primary HCCs from southern Africa. Four of five mutations detected were G----T substitutions, with clustering at codon 249. This mutation specificity could reflect exposure to a specific carcinogen, one candidate being aflatoxin B1 (ref. 7), a food contaminant in Africa, which is both a mutagen that induces G to T substitution and a liver-specific carcinogen. 
4	Silent cerebrovascular disease in the elderly. Correlation with ambulatory pressure. Does the average daily blood pressure correlate with hypertensive cerebrovascular disease better than the casual pressure, as has been reported in other target organ involvement? We investigated the associations of two abnormal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of a vascular etiology, low intense foci (lacunae), and periventricular hyperintense lesions on T1- and T2-weighted images, with both office and average daily blood pressure values in a population of 73 healthy normotensive and hypertensive elderly individuals (70 +/- 6 years old). Lacunae were detected in 34 subjects (47%); the number per subject ranged from 0 to 19 and was significantly correlated with advancing age. Furthermore, these changes were supposedly related to the average of noninvasive ambulatory (24-hour and during awake and asleep periods) pressure recordings but not to office pressures. The grade of periventricular hyperintensity was also significantly associated with advancing age and the average of ambulatory systolic pressure recordings, particularly during sleep, but not with office blood pressure. In comparisons of normotensive, "office hypertensive," and hypertensive subgroups, abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging were appropriate to the level of the 24-hour blood pressure measurements but not to that of clinic pressure. In hypertensive patients, the presence of electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was also associated with greater abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is superior to casual pressure measurements in predicting latent cerebrovascular disease, which is unexpectedly common in apparently healthy elderly subjects. 
5	Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair. 
3	Diagnostic evaluation of syncope Syncope is a common medical problem and is caused by a wide variety of diseases ranging from physiologic derangements with few consequences to conditions that may be immediately life-threatening. Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing. 
4	Spontaneous dural carotid-cavernous fistula with central retinal vein occlusion and iris neovascularization. Spontaneous dural carotid-cavernous fistulas are dural vascular malformations that usually run a benign course. We present a case of a spontaneously occurring dural carotid-cavernous fistula complicated by central retinal vein occlusion and iris neovascularization that led to progressive visual failure. 
4	Influence of right bundle branch block on short- and long-term survival after acute anterior myocardial infarction The impact of right bundle branch block on long-term prognosis after anterior wall myocardial infarction is unclear. In 932 patients with Q wave anterior infarction, the short- and long-term prognostic significance of the presence of right bundle branch block was analyzed. Compared with 754 patients without block, 178 patients with right bundle branch block after myocardial infarction showed an increased incidence of left ventricular failure (72% versus 52%, p less than 0.001) and increased in-hospital (32% versus 8%, p less than 0.001) and 1 year after hospital discharge (17% versus 7%, p less than 0.001) cardiac mortality rates. The presence of right bundle branch block was an independent predictor of increased in-hospital and 1-year mortality when entered in a multivariate analysis. However, the absence of left ventricular failure identified a subgroup of patients with right bundle branch block with low in-hospital (4%) and 1 year postdischarge (5%) cardiac mortality rates comparable with those of patients with neither failure nor right bundle branch block (1.7% and 4.8%, respectively). In the presence of left ventricular failure, patients with associated right bundle branch block had higher in-hospital (43% versus 14%, p less than 0.01) and 1 year postdischarge (24% versus 9%, p less than 0.01) cardiac mortality rates than those of patients with failure but no right bundle branch block. Thus, the presence of right bundle branch block after anterior myocardial infarction is an independent marker of poor prognosis. 
1	Erythropoietin receptors induced by dimethyl sulfoxide exhibit positive cooperativity associated with an amplified biologic response. Erythropoietin triggers the differentiation of erythrocyte progenitors by binding to receptors on their plasma membrane. We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway. 
2	Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria. 
3	A new syndrome of congenital hypoparathyroidism, severe growth failure, and dysmorphic features. Twelve infants (six boys, six girls) with severe hypocalcaemic tetany or convulsions were seen over a three year period. Nine patients were symptomatic in the newborn period. Their hypocalcaemia was associated with hyperphosphataemia and very low concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. None of the babies suffered from congenital cardiac disease. Cell mediated immunity, measured in five patients, was normal. There were no chromosomal abnormalities but all patients shared several dysmorphic features including deep set eyes, microcephaly, thin lips, beaked nose tip, external ear anomalies, micrognathia, and depressed nasal bridge. Mental retardation of varying degree was found in all patients. All had severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Four patients have died. The remaining eight patients are on treatments with vitamin D and calcium supplements with no change in their growth pattern. We believe that this association of congenital hypoparathyroidism with severe growth failure and dysmorphism represents a new syndrome. 
1	The effect of somatostatin on 5-hydroxytryptamine release from a carcinoid tumor. One of the major manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome is secretory diarrhea thought to be due to overproduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Synthetic somatostatin analogues have proved to be clinically effective in controlling this diarrhea. We have established a continuous cell line from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor that secretes 5-HT. We examined the ability of the somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, to inhibit 5-HT release in vitro. Tumor cells were exposed to SMS 201-995 (10(-6) mol/L), pentagastrin (10(-9) mol/L), acetylcholine (10(-5) mol/L), and isoproterenol (10(-5) mol/L) alone and in combination; 5-HT release was assayed with high pressure liquid chromatography. We found that pentagastrin (6.43 +/- 0.64 ng/ml), isoproterenol (20.24 +/- 2.17 ng/ml), and acetylcholine (12.39 +/- 1.10 ng/ml) each stimulated release of 5-HT compared to control values (4.38 +/- 0.42 ng/ml). SMS 201-995 significantly reduced release of 5-HT in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine but did not inhibit the effect of pentagastin. These data suggest that different agents do not act through the same pathway to stimulate 5-HT release from human pancreatic carcinoid cells. 
3	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. When levodopa withdrawal is the cause. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been described in patients receiving dopamine antagonists and in a few patients after withdrawal of dopaminergic antiparkinson therapy. Complications affect almost all organ systems and can be life-threatening. Most patients have fever, altered level of consciousness, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Treatment includes withdrawal of the causative agent and supportive therapy for complications. When withdrawal of a dopaminergic medication is the suspected cause, the agent should be reinstated. 
1	Clinical study of intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors producing alpha-fetoprotein. We present six patients with intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors that produced alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Their ages ranged from 8 to 20 years (average, 11.5 years old); two were male and four were female. Four of the tumors originated in the pineal region and two in the suprachiasmatic region. One patient treated with only radiation therapy died within 3 months of admission as a result of intraperitoneal metastasis via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Another patient, treated with radiation therapy and intrathecal administration of neocarzinostatin, died after 12 months because of tumor progression and subarachnoid dissemination. Two patients who received radiation and combination therapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin died after 13 and 25 months. The remaining two patients treated with radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) are now alive without recurrence after 16 and 19 months from admission. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide appears to be efficacious in the treatment of intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumor. 
5	Blockade of prostaglandin production increases cachectin synthesis and prevents depression of macrophage functions after hemorrhagic shock. Although hemorrhage severely depresses macrophage functions, it is not known whether the increased TNF-alpha or PGE2 production is responsible for it. To study this C3H/HeN mice were bled to mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg for 60 minutes, resuscitated, and treated with either ibuprofen (1.0 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline). Hemorrhage increased plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by 151.7% +/- 40.0% (p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased peritoneal macrophage (pM phi) antigen presentation (AP) by 60.5% +/- 7.3%, Ia expression by 52.3% +/- 7.6%, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis by 60.5% +/- 12.3% compared to shams. However ibuprofen treatment reduced PGE2 plasma levels by 61.3% +/- 12.1% and significantly increased AP (+237.0% +/- 95.3%), Ia expression (+72.8% +/- 27.5%), IL-1 synthesis (+235.7% +/- 134.7%), and cachectin synthesis (+485.8% +/- 209.0%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that prostaglandins but not cachectin are involved in the suppression of pM phi functions following hemorrhage because blockade of prostaglandin synthesis improved depressed macrophage functions despite enhanced cachectin synthesis. 
4	Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of crural arteries. The authors dilated 103 stenosed crural arteries in 71 patients. Primary success was defined as traversing and reducing the lesion to a residual stenosis of less than 30%. This was achieved in 96% of cases. Complications included one vessel rupture and one occluding intimal flap, which were treated by the vascular surgeon with bypass and venous patch, respectively. One hematoma at the puncture site was treated surgically because of its size. With modern materials such as steerable guide wires and low-profile balloon catheters, dilation of crural arteries has become safe. Until now, the indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of crural arteries have been limited to Fontaine stages III and IV disease. The authors believe that the indications for PTA in Fontaine stage IIb disease are justified, especially if intervention improves outflow after a more proximal recanalizing procedure is performed. 
4	Effect of indecainide in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Indecainide, a new antiarrhythmic agent classified as type Ic was evaluated in 11 patients with heart disease who had greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes/hour, moderate-to-marked left ventricular dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction 34% +/- 8%. Patients received indecainide, 50 mg by mouth, every 6 hours and the dose was increased until greater than or equal to 80% suppression was noted, adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 100 mg indecainide was given every 6 hours. Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed greater than or equal to 80% in nine patients (p less than 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia episodes were completely suppressed in five of eight patients. The effective or maximal mean daily indecainide dose was 191 +/- 32 mg; half of the responders achieved achieved efficacy at serum drug concentration greater than or equal to 600 ng/ml. Serum drug concentration was directly related to gender (r = 0.78, p less than 0.04) and inversely related to creatinine clearance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02). Indecainide prolonged mean PR and QRS intervals (p less than 0.05) but not QT or QTc. There was a linear relation between percent change in PR (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and QRS (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) intervals and serum drug concentration. After starting or increasing the dose, careful observation of patients with decreased renal function or reduced ejection fraction should be exercised because they attain higher drug concentration than normal subjects. 
1	Evolution of in vitro transformation and tumorigenesis of HPV16 and HPV18 immortalized primary cervical epithelial cells. Cervical carcinoma develops through a progressive spectrum of premalignant intraepithelial lesions (CIN I-III), the majority of which are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. We established HPV16 and HPV18 immortalized human cervical epithelial cell lines and used them as a model to investigate the genesis and progression of cervical malignancy. The cell lines when cultured in vitro in a system mimicking their in vivo environment exhibit cytologic atypia and a variety of defects in morphologic differentiation at early passage compared to their normal counterparts. With increased passage, these alterations progress to more severe grades, histologically similar to CIN III; however only a limited number of the cell lines are tumorigenic, mimicking the epidemiologic evidence on the rate of conversion from premalignant to invasive carcinoma. The observed changes are not associated with alterations of viral DNA integration or expression and may reflect specific cellular events or changes in virus-host interactions associated with malignant progression. 
2	Biphasic modulation of acetaminophen bioactivation and hepatotoxicity by pretreatment with the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Interferons and interferon induction can inhibit cytochromes P-450 and reduce the bioactivation and hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. However, since P-450 inhibition often is followed by P-450 induction, which would enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the possibility of a biphasic modulation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by interferons was investigated. Outbred male CD-1 mice of various ages, and young inbred male C57BL/6 mice were given the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C), 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, followed 1 to 48 days later by a single dose of acetaminophen, 300 to 450 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurring between 0 and 48 hr after acetaminophen treatment. Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen given within 8 days, with maximal inhibition between 1 and 4 days. Conversely, a maximal 7-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed in CD-1 mice when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 32 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). In the C57BL/6 strain, Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when given within 16 days, whereas a maximal 20-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 24 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). The mechanism of toxicologic enhancement was examined in male C57BL/6 mice using the same treatment regimen. Biochemical assessment of hepatotoxicity was confirmed by detailed histologic evaluation. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by production of the glutathione-derived cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Poly I-C pretreatment produced a 5-fold increase in acetaminophen-induced ALT release (P less than 0.05), which correlated with histologic evidence of centrilobular necrosis. Poly I-C pretreatment produced respective 3-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (P less than 0.05), which correlated with peak ALT concentrations (cysteine, r = 0.92, P less than 0.001; mercapturic acid, r = 0.75, P = 0.006). Thus, the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen can be inhibited when given within days after interferon induction, and conversely enhanced when given after several weeks. The toxicologic enhancement appears to be due to increased P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of acetaminophen. 
5	Identification, prevention, and treatment of silicone oil pupillary block after an inferior iridectomy. We treated two patients in whom silicone oil pupillary block developed despite a patent inferior iridectomy. The clinical characteristics of this complication were a deep anterior chamber, specular reflexes from the iris surface, identification by biomicroscopy of aqueous trapped inferiorly in the vitreous cavity, and no convection currents in the anterior chamber. This complication may be prevented by early face-down positioning of the patient after the operation, and the avoidance of large, centrally located, inferior iridectomies. We recommend that the iridectomy be placed peripherally no larger than 2 mm and propose a new technique for breaking the silicone oil block, which was clearly successful in one of the patients. 
5	Deep venous thrombosis: longitudinal study with duplex US. Forty-nine patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb were studied with repeated duplex ultrasound (US) for at least 1 year or until the vein became normal at US. Standard anticoagulant therapy was given for 3 months. In 36 patients, the veins became normal within 1 year. The likelihood of normalization increased if the lesion was located in only one site, if the pelvic veins were unaffected, if the affected leg was the left one, if the initial clot was nonocclusive, if there was no history of DVT, and if the symptoms had lasted less than than 24 hours. The average time before normalization was shorter if the symptoms had lasted less than 24 hours, that is, 11 weeks versus 25 weeks (P less than .02). The rate of sequelae at 1 year was lower if the US scan was normal or showed regression at 3 months, 6% versus 83% (P less than .00005). 
5	Role of leukotriene C4 in mucosal damage caused by necrotizing agents and indomethacin in the rat stomach. Intragastric ethanol stimulates mucosal formation of leukotriene C4 in the rat stomach. The present study demonstrates that the increase in leukotriene C4 formation begins within 30 seconds and is maximal within 5 minutes, closely paralleled by the appearance of hemorrhagic lesions. Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours, although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH, acidified 100 mmol/L taurocholate, 25% NaCl, or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2, indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol, NaOH, NaCl, or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and, to a lesser extent, leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa, inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886, however, did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin. On the other hand, certain protective compounds exhibit a striking parallelism between protection and inhibition of ethanol-induced leukotriene C4 formation, suggesting that they may affect a target crucial for both mucosal injury and stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase. 
5	Persistent neutrophilic meningitis. Persistent neutrophilic meningitis is an unusual but distinct clinical variant of chronic meningitis characterized by CSF neutrophilia with hypoglycorrhachia which persists for more than 1 week on serial CSF studies. Documented etiologies include selected bacteria and higher bacteria such as Brucella, Nocardia and Actinomyces as well as "opportunistic" fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, the Zygomycetes, and Pseudallescheria. Recognition of the syndrome is important, as empiric therapy (e.g., cotrimoxazole and amphotericin B) may differ significantly from that used for classic chronic meningitis. 
3	Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia occurs in nearly half of patients in hospital with cirrhosis and ascites, and is due to the excessive retention of free water which results from the kidney's inability to excrete it normally. The morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatraemia is largely attributable to central nervous system disturbances. The degree to which brain water content increases depends on the duration of hyponatraemia and on compensatory mechanisms. Altered steroid and peptide hormones in cirrhotic patients may contribute to the development of hyponatraemic encephalopathy, symptoms of which overlap with hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia. The occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis is unrelated to the rate of correction of hyponatraemia. The appearance of hyponatraemia in cirrhotic patients, long regarded as a poor prognostic sign, may be a function of unrecognized underlying impaired renal function. Therapy for hyponatraemia remains suboptimal. 
3	Mandibular osteomyelitis in a patient with sickle cell anemia: report of case. A case is presented in which mandibular osteomyelitis and mental nerve paresthesia developed in a patient with sickle cell anemia. This infection appeared to precipitate a sickle cell crisis. The mechanisms for these patients' propensity to infection and the diagnosis and management of sickle cell osteomyelitis of the jaws are discussed. 
2	Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%. 
2	In vitro model of intestinal crypt abscess. A novel neutrophil-derived secretagogue activity. In order to model crypt abscesses, a histological finding which correlates with disease activity in intestinal inflammation, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were layered onto monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, a crypt-like epithelium which is capable of Cl- secretion. Such PMN-epithelial interaction had no substantial effect on monolayer integrity or function. However, when PMN were stimulated by conditions including those present naturally in the human colonic lumen, monolayers responded with a bumetanide-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) indicative of Cl- secretion, the basis of secretory diarrhea. This Isc response was induced by a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (NDS), which was only active when applied to the luminal surface of monolayers and did not require PMN-epithelial contact. NDS activity is resistant to boiling, acid, and trypsin and passes a 500 nominal mol wt cutoff filter. NDS activity is not secondary to the respiratory burst products O2- or H2O2 and does not appear to be a myeloperoxidase product. We speculate NDS elicited Cl- secretion may contribute to the secretory diarrhea seen in patients with intestinal inflammation and crypt abscesses. 
5	Right-to-left shunt across a patent foramen ovale caused by cardiac tamponade: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade can manifest as profound hypoxemia from intracardiac shunting across a patent foramen ovale. As a consequence, pulmonary embolus can be erroneously diagnosed. As demonstrated in the case described herein, transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in determining the correct diagnosis, especially if transthoracic echocardiography is technically limited. In our patient, the findings on transesophageal echocardiography also helped determine the appropriate treatment. The relative inaccessibility of the pericardial effusion to needle drainage prompted open surgical drainage. 
2	Radiographic evaluation of suspected small bowel obstruction. Plain abdominal radiographs and enteroclysis studies were reviewed blindly in 117 consecutive patients undergoing enteroclysis for suspected small bowel obstruction. Plain radiographs were unreliably predictive of the presence of obstruction as determined by enteroclysis and surgery. Among patients with normal or abnormal nonspecific plain radiographs, varying degrees of small bowel obstruction were demonstrated by enteroclysis in 22%. Conversely, of patients with obstruction on plain radiographs, 42% had either normal enteroclysis studies or only minor adhesions. Enteroclysis correctly predicted the presence of obstruction in 100%, the absence of obstruction in 88%, the level (proximal vs distal) of obstruction in 89%, and the etiology of obstruction in 86% of operated patients. Enteroclysis is advocated as the definitive study in patients with clinical uncertainty about the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. 
4	An overview of intimal hyperplasia. Many hypotheses have been postulated for the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein and prosthetic grafts. In these hypotheses, the central theme seems to be endothelial injury, but not always denuding injury. As we progress into the biologic era with more sophisticated research tools, the study of the endothelial cell may give us the answers to the problem of intimal hyperplasia. In addition, the leukocyte is still a relatively unknown entity and further modification of their function may hold promise. 
5	Influence of preservation or perfusion of intraoperatively identified spinal cord blood supply on spinal motor evoked potentials and paraplegia after aortic surgery. Permanent ligation of arteries supplying blood to the spinal cord in operations for aortic aneurysm can lead to spinal cord ischemia, which can result in either paraparesis or paraplegia. This report describes a rapid method of intraoperative identification of those arteries that supply the spinal cord by use of an intrathecal platinum electrode to detect hydrogen in solution that has been injected into the aortic ostia. Preservation or perfusion of those identified arteries supplying the spinal cord may decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic complications. Of 28 porcine experiments with postoperative observation for 24 hours, there were 3 initial pilot experiments in which saline saturated with hydrogen was injected into the temporarily cross-clamped aorta. Twenty animals were then randomized to (1) preservation of only the vessels sequentially identified to supply blood to the spinal cord from T-13 to L-5 (n = 10); (2) division of the vessels supplying the spinal cord (n = 10). A further five animals underwent perfusion experiments wherein the identified cord arteries were perfused by a shunt, the other nonsupply arteries were divided, and the aorta was kept clamped for 45 minutes. Spinal motor evoked potentials were elicited with an intrathecal electrode and were highly sensitive for paralysis. Paralysis occurred in 0/3 pilot (p less than 0.013 vs division); 8/10 division; 1/10 preservation (p less than 0.0017 vs division); and perfusion 1/5 (p less than 0.025 vs division). Results of a pilot study in eight humans shows that the technique can be used to rapidly identify segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, to determine if distal perfusion is supplying the spinal cord with blood flow, and if reattached segmental arteries are patent. 
3	Microvascular sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in human falciparum malaria: a pathological study. Thirty-nine falciparum malaria autopsy cases from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand were divided into two groups that had had either cerebral malaria (CM) or non-cerebral malaria (NCM). We then studied significant pathological differences between these groups in order to investigate the correlation between parasitized erythrocyte (PRBC) sequestration in small blood vessels in the brain, heart, lungs and small intestines. We found that the percentage of PRBC sequestration in the organs which we studied was higher in the CM patients than in the NCM patients. The difference of PRBC sequestration among the organs of two groups was significant (P less than 0.05). In the CM group, the average percentage of PRBC sequestration in the brain was significantly higher than in the heart, lungs and small intestines (P less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between PRBC sequestration in the brains, hearts, lungs and small intestines in the NCM group (P greater than 0.05). Our study indicates that severity of malaria in the CM patients depends on PRBC sequestration, especially in the brain. A combination of functional disturbances of the other organs, in addition to the cerebral pathology, may augment the severity of the disease. 
3	Traumatic asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia is a distinctive clinical syndrome characterized by cervicofacial cyanosis and edema, multiple petechiae, and subconjunctival hemorrhage after a severe crush injury of the thorax or of the upper part of the abdomen. A case of traumatic asphyxia is reported, and its clinical and pathophysiologic features are discussed. 
5	Image cytophotometric DNA analysis of atypical hyperplasias and intraductal carcinomas of the breast. With the use of image analysis, DNA content was quantified on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 25 atypical hyperplasias and 35 intraductal carcinomas of the breast by comparison of integrated gray levels of Feulgen-stained control and ductal cell nuclei. The mean full-peak (G0/G1) control cell DNA histogram coefficient of variation was 5.5%. DNA aneuploidy was more common in intraductal carcinomas compared with atypical hyperplasias (71% of intraductal carcinomas vs 36% of atypical hyperplasias) and correlated with a lack of cytologic (nuclear) and architectural differentiation (63% moderate vs 93% poor and 38% cribriform vs 82% solid). In addition, multiple DNA stemlines were observed in 40% of intraductal carcinomas. We conclude that (1) some atypical hyperplasias demonstrate abnormal DNA content consistent with neoplastic transformation, (2) aggressive forms of intraductal carcinoma are more frequently associated with DNA content abnormalities, and (3) frequent DNA stemline heterogeneity in intraductal carcinoma supports the hypothesis that multiple genetic events occur in the development of mammary intraepithelial neoplasia. 
1	Intraosseous lipoma within the femoral head. A case report. Intraosseous lipoma occurring within the femoral head seems not to have been previously reported. Symptoms associated with the tumor included slowly increasing pain and a cystic lesion shown on roentgenograms. Management was by total hip arthroplasty. Pathologic examination of the specimen showed that the tumor was composed almost entirely of mature adipose tissue in keeping with a diagnosis of Stage 1 intraosseous lipoma. A sclerotic border and osteoid seams were noted, two features that seem not to have been previously reported in early lesions. Recent papers suggest intraosseous lipomas are more common than previously thought, and the femur now accounts for 25% of reported cases. 
5	Restenosis after directional coronary atherectomy: differences between primary atheromatous and restenosis lesions and influence of subintimal tissue resection. Rates of restenosis were evaluated in 70 patients (74 lesions) after successful directional coronary atherectomy. The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions. After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected. Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%). There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%). Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01). Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37). These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty. The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions. 
5	Post-traumatic basal ganglia hemorrhage: analysis of 52 patients with emphasis on the final outcome. A series of 52 patients suffering post-traumatic basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) after closed head injury is reviewed. Post-traumatic BGH was associated with other intracranial lesions in most cases. The outcome in this series is rather good, with 53.8% of patients having a functional survival. Radiologically, the post-traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and brainstem hemorrhage usually coexisted with a poor outcome. Old age (greater than 60), abnormal pupil reaction, impaired oculocephalic response, and abnormal motor response to pain stimuli are reliable clinical hallmarks for poor prognosis. 
3	Seizures and other neurologic sequelae of bacterial meningitis in children. BACKGROUND. Although the mortality rate among children with bacterial meningitis has decreased dramatically in recent decades, some patients are left with neurologic sequelae. It has not been clearly established which features of the acute illness predict the chronic neurologic sequelae, including late seizures or epilepsy. METHODS. We followed 185 infants and children prospectively during and after acute bacterial meningitis. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.9 years (range, 0.1 to 15.5). During the first six years standard neurologic examinations were performed; telephone interviews were conducted thereafter. RESULTS. One month after meningitis, 69 children (37 percent) had neurologic abnormalities. Many of these signs resolved within a year, leaving only 26 children (14 percent) with persistent deficits: 18 (10 percent) had only sensorineural hearing loss, and 8 (4 percent) had multiple neurologic deficits. Thirteen children (7 percent) had one or more late seizures not associated with fever. The presence of persistent neurologic deficits indicative of cerebral injury was the only independent predictor of late afebrile seizures (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. After bacterial meningitis only children with permanent neurologic deficits are at high risk for epilepsy. Those with normal examinations after the acute illness have an excellent change of escaping serious neurologic sequelae, including epilepsy. 
5	Cavernous-carotid thrombosis and ocular motor paresis A 64-year-old man presented with the acute onset of unilateral blindness and ipsilateral ocular motor paresis. Occlusion of the central retinal artery associated with thrombosis of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus was demonstrated by angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Cases of carotid thrombosis associated with ipsilateral ocular motor paresis are rare. The pathophysiology of intracavernous carotid thrombosis is discussed in connection with blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus. 
1	Titrated intravenous barbiturates in the control of symptoms in patients with terminal cancer. Patients with terminal cancer may have a series of severe and dehumanizing physical and psychologic symptoms. To improve symptom control in the final days and hours of life, we administer intravenous barbiturates continuously to provide heavy sedation or continuous somnolence. Titrated dosage is then reduced to a minimum, after a desired steady-state has been achieved. Improved symptom control is provided, and the patient's dignity is maintained until death. 
5	Diagnostic relevance of clonal cytogenetic aberrations in malignant soft-tissue tumors. BACKGROUND. Malignant soft-tissue tumors often present substantial diagnostic challenges. Chromosome aberrations that might be diagnostic have been identified in some types of soft-tissue tumors, but the overall frequency and diagnostic relevance of these aberrations have not been established. METHODS. We attempted to determine the karyotypes of a series of 62 consecutive, unselected malignant spindle-cell or small round-cell soft-tissue tumors (from 46 adults and 16 children) after direct harvesting of cells or short-term culture. All tumors were examined independently by immunohistochemical staining in addition to routine light-microscopical evaluation, and all but two tumors were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS. Metaphases were obtained from 61 of the 62 tumors, and clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 55 (89 percent). In the six tumors that yielded metaphases but lacked apparent clonal aberrations, the normal metaphases were found to originate from non-neoplastic stromal elements within the tumor specimens. Thus, all tumors in which karyotyping was successful contained clonal chromosome aberrations. Forty of 62 tumors (65 percent) contained clonal chromosome aberrations that either suggested or confirmed a specific diagnosis; in 15 of these tumors (24 percent of all tumors), the aberrations were important in establishing the final diagnosis. Cytogenetic analyses were particularly informative about small round-cell tumors from children: 8 of 14 round-cell tumors contained diagnostically important chromosome aberrations. Using the combined approaches of light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics, we established an unambiguous diagnosis for 60 of 62 tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analyses reveal clonal chromosome aberrations in virtually all malignant soft-tissue tumors. These clonal chromosome aberrations, particularly in small round-cell tumors in children, often have diagnostic relevance. 
1	Adjuvant topical chemotherapy versus immunotherapy in primary superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. In a prospective randomised controlled study, the efficacy of ethoglucid was compared with that of keyhole-limpet haemocyanin (KLH) in preventing recurrent tumours following transurethral resection of primary superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Patients treated with ethoglucid (n = 39) received 0.565 g (1% solution) ethoglucid weekly for 6 weeks and then monthly for 1 year. Patients treated with KLH (n = 38) were immunised subcutaneously with 1 mg KLH; bladder instillations of 30 mg were then given weekly for 6 weeks and thereafter monthly for 1 year. The recurrence rates, disease-free intervals and tumour progression rates were evaluated. The end-point of the study was either progression in stage or grade or more than 1 recurrence during the observation period. The minimum length of follow-up was 1 year. The recurrence rates, mean disease-free intervals and progression rates in the 2 groups showed no statistically significant differences. 
4	Why is diabetes mellitus a stronger risk factor for fatal ischemic heart disease in women than in men? The Rancho Bernardo Study [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 26;265(24):3249] We report here the 14-year sex-specific effect of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease in a geographically defined population of men and women aged 40 through 79 years. There were 207 men and 127 women who had diabetes at baseline based on medical history or fasting hyperglycemia. They were compared with 2137 adults who had fasting euglycemia and a negative personal and family history of diabetes. The relative hazard of ischemic heart disease death in diabetics vs nondiabetics was 1.8 in men and 3.3 in women, after adjusting for age, and 1.9 and 3.3, respectively, after adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, and cigarette smoking using the Cox regression model. The sex difference in the independent contribution of diabetes to fatal heart disease was largely explained by the persistently more favorable survival rate of women (than men) without diabetes. 
2	Intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to amyloidosis responsive to cisapride. A case of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to systemic amyloidosis in a patient with multiple myeloma is described. Gastrointestinal symptoms and indices of nutrition improved markedly after commencing treatment with cisapride, which may have been responsible for relatively prolonged survival compared with similar reported cases. 
4	Current status of antitachycardia devices. With the limitations of currently available modalities for treating clinically important tachycardias, the role of implanted antitachycardia devices will continue to expand. The challenge of the future will not only involve continued technological advances but the socioeconomic impact of this efficacious but expensive mode of therapy in an era of increasing financial restraints. Further studies to definitively prove the efficacy of more widespread use of antitachycardia device therapy will be needed. 
3	Superiority of transesophageal echocardiography in detecting cardiac source of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemia of uncertain etiology. The diagnostic yield of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography for identifying a cardiac source of embolism was compared in 79 patients presenting with unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack. There were 35 men and 44 women with a mean age of 59 years (range 17 to 84); 52% had clinical cardiac disease. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were performed using Doppler color flow and contrast imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography identified a potential cardiac source of embolism in 57% of the overall study group compared with only 15% by transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.0005). Compared with transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography more frequently identified atrial septal aneurysm associated with a patent foramen ovale (9 versus 1 of 79 patients, p less than 0.005), left atrial thrombus or tumor (6 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.05) and left atrial spontaneous contrast (13 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.0005). All cases of left atrial thrombus or spontaneous contrast were identified in patients with clinically identified cardiac disease. In the 38 patients with no cardiac disease, transesophageal echocardiography identified isolated atrial septal aneurysm and atrial septal aneurysm with a patent foramen ovale more frequently than transthoracic echocardiography (8 versus 2 of 38 patients, p less than 0.05). The two techniques had a similar rate of identifying apical thrombus and mitral valve prolapse. Overall, transesophageal echocardiography identified abnormalities in 39% of patients with no cardiac disease versus 19% for transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.005). Thus, transesophageal echocardiography identifies potential cardiac sources of embolism in the majority of patients presenting with unexplained stroke. 
5	High-frequency oscillatory ventilation compared with conventional intermittent mechanical ventilation in the treatment of respiratory failure in preterm infants: neurodevelopmental status at 16 to 24 months of postterm age. The HIFI Study Group. The High-Frequency Intervention Trial was a 10-center randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFO) in the treatment of neonates weighing 750 to 2000 gm; 327 infants were assigned to HFO and 346 to conventional intermittent mechanical ventilation (IMV). Survival and lung morbidity rates were the same in the two groups. Bayley psychometric evaluations and CNS examination were performed at 16 to 24 months of postterm age in 77% of the survivors (185 HFO and 201 IMV). There was no difference in growth or respiratory status at follow-up. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 19 (10%) HFO-treated infants and 23 (11%) IMV-treated infants. There was no difference in severity between the two groups. A significantly higher incidence of hydrocephalus (12% vs 6%) was present in the HFO group (p less than 0.05). Bayley index scores greater than 83 were scored in 57% of HFO-treated infants compared with 66% of IMV-treated infants. The proportion of children at follow-up with a normal neuro-developmental status (i.e., Bayley score greater than 83 and no major CNS defect) was significantly less in the HFO than in the IMV group (54 vs 65%; p less than 0.05). Both treatment groups showed a strong association between the presence of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage and the development of major CNS or cognitive defects. No significant long-term beneficial or deleterious effects were demonstrated in the use of HFO versus IMV for the treatment of respiratory failure in low birth weight premature infants, except that there were slightly more neurologic deficits in the HFO group related to the higher proportion of survivors with major intraventricular hemorrhage. 
5	Ehrlichiosis in children. Tick-borne rickettsiae of the genus Ehrlichia have recently been recognized as a cause of human illness in the United States. In the years 1986-1988, 10 cases of ehrlichiosis were diagnosed in children in Oklahoma. Fever and headache were universal: myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia were also common. Rash was observed in six patients but was a prominent finding in only one. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were common laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were treated with tetracycline, three with chloramphenicol, and one was not treated with antibiotics: all recovered. The onset of illness in spring and early summer for most cases paralleled the time when Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis are most active, suggesting that one or both ticks may be vectors of human ehrlichiosis in Oklahoma. 
5	Squamous carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall. We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall. Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups. Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone. Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy. Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation. 
2	CT diagnosis of acquired small bowel volvulus. Small-bowel volvulus is an uncommon but important cause of small-bowel obstruction and often results in ischemia or infarction. Clinical examination and plain film radiography may be nondiagnostic, leading to delay in surgical intervention with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality. We present two patients in whom the diagnosis of strangulating small-bowel volvulus was made by computed tomography (CT), allowing rapid surgical correction of this potentially life-threatening condition. 
2	A pitfall in azygos vein cannulation in cirrhotic patients: mistaken cannulation of the mammary vein. Azygos venous flow can be measured by a thermodilution catheter in patients with cirrhosis. This is a useful technique since azygos flow is thought to reflect the superior portosystemic collateral flow in these patients. The authors report 3 cases in which mistaken internal mammary vein cannulation mimicked azygos vein cannulation in the supine fluoroscopic view. A lateral fluoroscopic view confirmed internal mammary cannulation. They suggest that if the azygos arch is unpronounced or flow measurements are unexpectedly low in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, a lateral view be performed to rule out internal mammary vein cannulation. 
5	Adenocarcinoma arising in a foregut cyst of the mediastinum. A case of malignant transformation in a mediastinal cyst of the esophageal reduplication type is presented. The cyst had been recognized 39 years previously, but remained asymptomatic until sudden growth occurred. It was resected totally from the esophagus and the patient recovered well. A review of the literature showed that malignancy in mediastinal foregut cysts is extremely rare. 
1	Flow cytometric evaluation of chemosensitive and chemoresistant head and neck tumors. For patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, a clinical response to induction chemotherapy has correlated with a survival advantage. Similarly, patients with diploid tumors have displayed a survival advantage when compared with patients with aneuploid tumors. This study examined DNA content in 33 patients who had undergone induction chemotherapy as part of two clinical protocols to determine if there was a correlation between the patients with diploid tumors and the patients with a clinical response to chemotherapy. Although patients with stage III tumors had a longer disease-free survival than stage IV patients (p less than 0.0002), the addition of DNA content information did not improve the ability to predict response. Specifically, there was no correlation between DNA content and the response to chemotherapy. In addition, for this group of patients, a diploid DNA content was not correlated with a survival advantage. We conclude that DNA content information did not add significantly to the prediction of clinical outcome in these patients who received induction chemotherapy. 
5	An insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene accounting for half the variance of serum enzyme levels. A polymorphism consisting of the presence or absence of a 250-bp DNA fragment was detected within the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE) using the endothelial ACE cDNA probe. This polymorphism was used as a marker genotype in a study involving 80 healthy subjects, whose serum ACE levels were concomitantly measured. Allele frequencies were 0.6 for the shorter allele and 0.4 for the longer allele. A marked difference in serum ACE levels was observed between subjects in each of the three ACE genotype classes. Serum immunoreactive ACE concentrations were, respectively, 299.3 +/- 49, 392.6 +/- 66.8, and 494.1 +/- 88.3 micrograms/liter, for homozygotes with the longer allele (n = 14), and heterozygotes (n = 37) and homozygotes (n = 29) with the shorter allele. The insertion/deletion polymorphism accounted for 47% of the total phenotypic variance of serum ACE, showing that the ACE gene locus is the major locus that determines serum ACE concentration. Concomitant determination of the ACE genotype will improve discrimination between normal and abnormal serum ACE values by allowing comparison with a more appropriate reference interval. 
5	Rapid percutaneous tracheostomy We describe a new method of performing percutaneous tracheostomy rapidly and safely using a specialized instrument kit. The technique permits the safe insertion of a full-sized 7.0 (ID) or 7.5 mm (ID) cuffed cannula into the trachea within 1-2 min, through the membranous second intercartilagenous space. Animal studies have demonstrated a superior healing process compared to that seen after conventional tracheostomy techniques. 
4	Portal venous gas in a patient with Crohn's disease. Portal venous gas usually occurs in the setting of an acute abdomen. Several causes for benign portal venous gas (PVG) have been reported. We describe the finding of PVG by computed tomography in a febrile patient with Crohn's disease and discuss the clinical implications of such a finding. 
3	Medicare Peer Review Organization preprocedure review criteria. An analysis of criteria for three procedures The Medicare Peer Review Organization (PRO) program includes preprocedure review using explicit criteria to assess the appropriateness of specific procedures. This study evaluates the variability in the PRO preprocedure criteria for the three procedures most frequently reviewed by PROs: carotid endarterectomy, cataract removal, and cardiac pacemaker implants. In August 1989, the PRO review criteria were received from the Health Care Financing Administration. To provide a reference point for reviewing the PRO criteria, national practice guidelines for these three procedures were identified. Wide variability was demonstrated in the PRO procedure-specific carotid endarterectomy and cataract removal review criteria among PROs, and the criteria differed significantly from the identified practice guidelines. The criteria for cardiac pacemaker implants were somewhat less variable, and were based, to varying degrees, on practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Greater attention is needed to improve the development of review criteria, including the use of relevant practice guidelines, to ensure that review criteria are optimal. 
1	Adjuvant antiestrogen therapy for breast cancer. Past, present, and future. Laboratory investigations using animal models of breast cancer growth have indicated that the antiestrogenic compound tamoxifen is a tumoristatic agent. It is therefore effective in suppressing, rather than destroying, the breast tumor. Its use as an adjuvant in breast cancer management has been successful, with a proportion of women benefiting from long periods of tamoxifen treatment. All the initial studies recruited postmenopausal women, but tamoxifen is now proposed for the treatment of premenopausal women for an extended time. Naturally, there are many aspects of the toxicology of tamoxifen to consider; however, careful monitoring of clinical trials will determine the safety of the drug for the general patient population. 
4	A positron emission tomographic comparison of pulmonary vascular permeability during the adult respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. We measured extravascular density (EVD) and the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER) for 68Ga-transferrin using positron emission tomography in 14 normal volunteers and 29 patients with radiographic infiltrates, including six patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), eight patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 15 patients with focal pneumonia. Contralateral, radiographically normal regions were also evaluated in the patients with focal pneumonia. Mean EVD was elevated in the patients with CHF, ARDS, and pneumonia in regions of radiographic infiltrate compared with values from normal subjects (p less than 0.05), but it was not significantly different among the three patient groups. PTCER in normal subjects and in patients with CHF was not significantly different (21 +/- 11 versus 44 +/- 16 x 10(-4) min-1, respectively, p = NS). PTCER was elevated in regions of infiltrate because of either pneumonia (173 +/- 99) or ARDS (170 +/- 79). PTCER was also elevated in regions contralateral to those with focal infiltrate during pneumonia, even though these regions were radiographically normal and had normal EVD values. These results suggest that PTCER is a sensitive but nonspecific index of abnormal pulmonary vascular permeability, which may be useful for classifying patients in clinical studies of pulmonary edema. 
4	Effects of fish-oil ingestion on cardiovascular risk factors in hyperlipidemic subjects in Israel: a randomized, double-blind crossover study. Effects of a daily fish-oil supplement on serum lipids, apolipoproteins, and some platelet functions and hemorheologic variables were examined in 27 hyperlipidemic subjects in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover fashion with an identically encapsulated vegetable oil serving as the control treatment. Despite the habitual high linoleic acid intake of the study population, significant incorporation of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids into the serum, platelet, and erythrocyte lipids was observed after the fish-oil supplement. Ingestion of fish oil resulted in a 40% decrease in the triglyceride concentration, a 12% increase in HDL cholesterol, and a significant decrease in plasma viscosity, whereas the vegetable-oil placebo had no significant effect. We conclude that a moderate intake of fish oil (15 g/d) is a feasible treatment for hypertriglyceridemia even in patients with a background of high linoleic acid intake and that it may have a beneficial effect on several cardiovascular risk factors. 
5	Mesial temporal sclerosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is probably the most common symptomatic pathologic entity--alone or mixed with other pathologic features--for seizures of temporal lobe origin. The pathophysiology of MTS, including any genetic influence, needs clarification. A characteristic ictal expression for seizures of MTS origin appears not to exist. The majority of patients (78%) with postresection MTS who are seizure-free have tightly localized interictal abnormalities restricted to F7/F8, Sp1/Sp2, T3/T4, and T5/T6 more than 96% of the time. MRI abnormalities may be seen in 55% of patients with MTS if both "hard" and "soft" criteria are used or in 20% when only "hard" criteria are used. The neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with MTS, which includes intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), may prove to be increasingly useful in identifying patterns of cognitive deficit that correlate with enhancement of both lateralizing and localizing preoperative information. 
3	Cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the tardive cauda equina syndrome of ankylosing spondylitis. Typical cauda equina syndrome secondary to long-standing ankylosing spondylitis is reported in a 63-year-old man. Radionuclide cisternography demonstrated a resorption defect of cerebrospinal fluid in the enlarged lumbosacral dural sac. After transient symptomatic improvement with acetazolamide, a lumboperitoneal shunt was placed. The rate of cerebrospinal fluid, isotope resorption became normal. In the 5 years of follow-up, partial remission has been observed. 
5	Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms. 
2	Perirectal abscess in Crohn's disease. Drainage and outcome. The role of surgical intervention in the treatment of patients with anorectal Crohn's disease is controversial. To clarify the success of aggressive drainage and the subsequent clinical course of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscesses, the authors reviewed the records of 38 patients who presented with this condition during an eight-year period. Twenty-two male and 16 female patients (median age, 32 years; range, 17 to 61 years) with clinically or pathologically confirmed Crohn's disease of the bowel underwent operation for perirectal abscesses. Thirty-two percent of patients had no previous history of anorectal Crohn's disease. Thirty simple abscesses and 8 complex horseshoe abscesses were treated. At operation, 53 percent of patients underwent incision and drainage whereas 26 percent received loop indwelling drains and 21 percent had mushroom catheters placed. After resolution of the index abscess, recurrent abscesses occurred in 45 percent of the patients who underwent catheter drainage and 56 percent of the patients who underwent incision and drainage. More importantly, 44 percent of the incision and drainage group and only 31 percent of the catheter drainage group required subsequent proctectomy to control perineal sepsis. The healing time of the perineal wound was longer than six months in 83 percent of patients requiring rectal excision. We concluded that long-term catheter drainage may offer substantial benefit in the overall outcome of the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and perirectal abscess. 
5	Changes in the postenteropathic form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome in children. An analysis was made of clinical and laboratory findings in children with the diarrheal form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) treated at The Children's Hospital, Birmingham between 1970 und 1987. From 1982 the rate of referral increased, the prodromal illness more often consisted of bloody diarrhea, and the mean age at presentation doubled from 2 to 4 years. For patients with a good outcome there was an excess of males in the period 1970-81, and females in the period 1982-87. Moreover, in the years 1982-87 the disorder was distinguished from that of the earlier time by a positive correlation between adverse outcome and both neutrophil leukocytosis and a higher hemoglobin concentration at presentation. Prognostic scores obtained by logistic regression analysis were specific for each period. From July 1983 stool samples were analyzed for verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) and neutralizable verotoxin. Positive results were obtained in 39% of cases. The nature of HUS has changed and the new form of the disorder is associated with VTEC infection. 
5	Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy. 
1	Role of mastectomy in breast cancer. The surgical management of breast cancer continues to evolve in an attempt to define the ideal line between therapeutic efficacy and morbidity. It is clear that breast cancer is a biologically heterogeneous group of diseases, and no single hypothesis explains its behavior. The surgical options proposed to the individual patient must draw from the experience of retrospective clinical studies and prospective randomized trials in an attempt to optimize the treatment plan. Most patients without distant disease are eligible to consider mastectomy, which can accomplish excellent local control and significantly improve survival for earlier stages of disease. However, breast conservation remains an appropriate alternative for a carefully defined subset of patients. Today, with early-stage disease, no patient need leave the operating room without a breast. Recent advances in reconstructive surgery make mastectomy with immediate reconstruction or limited resection plus axillary dissection with postoperative radiation therapy the two principal treatment choices available. Future studies will focus on the integration of other treatment modalities. Clinical research into the use of preoperative chemotherapy to downstage the disease to permit less extensive surgery is of interest. Recent application of molecular biologic techniques such as oncogene analysis, cytogenetic studies, proliferative indices, and the highly sensitive detection of distant micrometastases using monoclonal antibodies may assist in the design of innovative approaches to surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic drug treatment. These advances show great promise for improving the quality of life and the cure rate for patients with breast cancer. Today, surgical treatment options have evolved that fulfill some of the objectives outlined by Dr. James Ewing of Memorial Hospital some 50 years ago. His concerns about breast cancer remain as relevant today as they were half a century ago: "I have drawn the impression that in dealing with mammary cancer, surgery meets with more peculiar difficulties and uncertainties than with almost any other form of the disease. The anatomical types are so numerous, the variations in clinical course so wide, the paths of dissemination so free and diverse, the difficulties of determining the actual conditions so complex, and the sacrifice of tissues so great, as to render impossible in the majority of cases a reasonably accurate adjustment of a means to an end.". 
3	Fetal alcohol syndrome in adolescents and adults. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a specific recognizable pattern of malformation. Manifestations in 61 adolescents and adults suffering from alcohol teratogenesis are presented. After puberty, the faces of patients with fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects were not as distinctive. Patients tended to remain short and microcephalic, although their weight was somewhat closer to the mean. The average IQ was 68, but the range of IQ scores widely varied. Average academic functioning was at the second- to fourth-grade levels, with arithmetic deficits most characteristic. Maladaptive behaviors such as poor judgment, distractibility, and difficulty perceiving social cues were common. Family environments were remarkably unstable. Fetal alcohol syndrome is not just a childhood disorder; there is a predictable long-term progression of the disorder into adulthood, in which maladaptive behaviors present the greatest challenge to management. 
3	From disease to delirium: managing the declining elderly patient. Many geriatric patients have concurrent physical and psychiatric illnesses, but at times it may be difficult to determine which is primary. Delirium, a transient syndrome that presents with psychiatric symptoms, is usually the manifestation of an organic disorder and, if undetected and untreated, can be fatal. Clinicians, therefore, must learn to recognize the syndrome, search diligently for the underlying etiology, and treat accordingly. 
4	A comparison of coarctation resection and subclavian flap angioplasty using ultrasonographically monitored postocclusive reactive hyperemia The reported relatively high incidence of early restenosis at the coarctation repair site with subclavian flap angioplasty, especially in infants less than 3 months of age, prompted a physiologically oriented analysis of relief of obstruction from coarctation after subclavian flap angioplasty versus resection and end-to-end anastomosis in infancy. Twenty-one patients who had undergone repair of coarctation in infancy by either subclavian flap angioplasty (nine patients) (median age 8 years) or resection and end-to-end anastomosis (12 patients) (median age 8 years) were evaluated by Doppler spectrum analysis of the blood flow velocities in the femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia. The median resting right upper to lower limb systolic pressure difference (with interquartile range) was similar in the angioplasty, resection and anastomosis, and control groups: -5 mm Hg (18 mm Hg), 0 mm Hg (12 mm Hg), and -2.5 mm Hg (10 mm Hg), respectively. Also, similar resting values for the maximum frequency of the advancing curve and the pulsatility and resistance indices were measured in the three groups. During reactive hyperemia of the leg, however, a significant hemodynamic obstruction across the repair site became clinically manifest in the angioplasty group only, as documented by a lower pulsatility index in comparison with the control group (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). Comparison of the hemodynamic results between the angioplasty and resection and anastomosis groups in subdivisions of infants operated on at an age of less or greater than 3 months, both at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed, already at rest, a significantly lower value for the pulsatility index in the former angioplasty subdivision (p = 0.05, Student's t test), indicating a significant resistance at the coarctation repair site in the angioplasty patients operated on before the third month of life. A disadvantage of angioplasty (compared with resection and anastomosis) was noted when angioplasty was performed before the third month of life, and an unequivocal lack of advantage was noted when performed beyond that period regarding relief of obstruction from coarctation. In addition, a definite potential for adverse long-term effects on the hemodynamics of the left upper limb after subclavian flap angioplasty in infancy has been documented. For these reasons we prefer to perform resection and end-to-end anastomosis for repair of coarctation in infancy. 
2	Hereditary internal anal sphincter myopathy causing proctalgia fugax and constipation. A newly identified condition. A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. 
1	Fatal sepsis following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration for bladder cancer. Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Complications from bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy are usually minor but serious and even fatal reactions can occur. Five recent cases illustrate the gravity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin sepsis. One man with severe debility and the organic brain syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment should not be administered in the presence of severe cystitis or after grossly traumatic catheterization. 
4	Results of intracoronary stents for management of coronary dissection after balloon angioplasty. Dissections after coronary balloon angioplasty are risk factors for acute or subacute vessel closures. Intracoronary stenting was developed to avoid these complications by pressing the intimal and medial flaps against the vessel wall, thus reducing the risk of acute thrombosis. A total of 22 stents were implanted into the coronary arteries of 15 patients with dissections after balloon angioplasty causing angina pectoris or ischemic electrocardiographic changes. Stent delivery was successful in all cases. In 1 patient acute stent thrombosis was documented and treated successfully by thrombolytic therapy. Another patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery 24 hours later because of persisting angina. Angiograms after 24 hours documented vessel patency in the remaining 14 patients. Late control angiograms after 4 to 6 months were obtained in 12 of 14 patients. Vessel patency without significant restenosis was observed in 8 patients, restenosis in 3 and reocclusion in 1 patient. All 3 patients with multiple stent implantation had restenosis (n = 2) or reocclusion (n = 1), compared with 1 patient with single stent implantation. Thus, intracoronary stenting appears to be a secure and effective method of handling bailout situations caused by dissection after balloon angioplasty, with good long-term results when only a single stent is implanted. 
1	Estimation of PR and ER by immunocytochemistry in breast cancer. Comparison with radioligand binding methods. Immunocytochemical assays for progesterone receptor (PR) using monoclonal antirabbit PR antibodies (PR-ICA) and for estrogen receptor (ER) (ER-ICA) were compared with radioligand binding (dextran-coated charcoal [DCC]) methods for receptor determination in patients with breast cancer. Immunocytochemical staining for PR was exclusively nuclear in localization. In this regard, PR staining is similar to previous findings for ER; PR-ICA showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%. ER-ICA was also 89% sensitive and similarly specific. There was good correlation between the degree and intensity of staining and quantitative binding of radioligand. Receptor-positive tumors, however, show considerable variation of immunocytochemical staining, suggesting heterogeneity of cellular PR content. The availability of an immunocytochemical assay for PR increases the discriminatory potential for these methods of receptor determination. 
2	Cimetidine suppresses chemically induced experimental hepatic porphyria. The ability of cimetidine to reduce the activity of hepatic aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA-S) was examined in allylisopropyl acetamide (AIA) treated porphyric adult rats. A dose of 20 mg cimetidine/100 gm body weight resulted in a 50% decrease in the AIA-induced hepatic ALA-S activity compared to rats treated with AIA alone. Heme oxygenase activity was decreased 25% compared to rats treated with AIA alone. The effects of AIA and cimetidine on cytochrome P-450 were not additive, suggesting competition for a common site of interaction. The results suggest that cimetidine may prove to be useful in treating porphyria in humans. 
4	Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the aorta associated with aortic dissection. We report a unique case of primary aortic malignant fibrous histiocytoma presenting clinically as aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this occurrence is the first ever reported. The magnetic resonance imaging technique may provide superiority in the differential diagnosis between tumor and hematoma of aortic dissection. Aortic tumor, although rare, should be included among the causes of aortic dissection. 
4	The influence of elastic compression stockings on deep venous hemodynamics. To determine the effect of elastic compression stockings on deep venous hemodynamics we measured ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, amplitude of venous pressure excursion, and duplex-derived common femoral and popliteal vein diameter and peak flow velocities with and without stockings in 10 healthy subjects and 16 patients with chronic deep venous insufficiency. The effects of below-knee and above-knee 30 to 40 torr and 40 to 50 torr gradient stockings were studied. Despite documentation of substantial stocking compressive effects by skin pressure measurements, neither below-knee or above-knee elastic compression stockings significantly improved ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, or the amplitude of venous pressure excursion in healthy patients or in patients with deep venous insufficiency (p greater than 0.05). In patients with deep venous insufficiency stockings modestly increased popliteal vein diameter and flow velocity in the upright resting position (p less than 0.02). After tiptoe exercise without stockings deep venous peak flow velocity increased in healthy patients and in patients with deep venous insufficiency by a mean of 103% in the popliteal vein and 46% in the common femoral vein (p less than 0.01). With the application of elastic compression stockings only modest augmentation of deep venous flow velocity occurred in both groups above that seen in the bare leg after exercise. Thus elastic compression stockings did not improve deep venous hemodynamic measurements in patients with deep venous insufficiency. The beneficial effects of stockings in the treatment of deep venous insufficiency must relate to effects other than changes in deep venous hemodynamics. 
5	Stressful experience and cardiorespiratory disorders. Ever since Selye's time, the belief has persisted that the outcome of stressful experience is disease. The likelihood of this eventuality is increased when the experience is damaging, unavoidable, or uncontrollable. However, in most stressful instances, these conditions do not occur. The experience either is overcome or produces disturbances in physiological functions without structural change. The prevalence of "functional" disorders are far more common in medical practice than is disease. Among the most interesting of these is the hyperventilation syndrome, which may mimic or be confused with ischemic heart disease. Its symptomatology and physiology are complex. The syndrome may produce coronary vasospasm, but it may also complicate ischemic heart disease. It is even believed that chronic hyperventilation may be a risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Stressful experience consisting of various tasks and challenges may also produce myocardial perfusion deficits in ischemic heart disease, presumably secondary to vasospasm. These deficits are in turn considerably more frequent in any one patient than ST segment changes in the electrocardiogram or the incidence of angina pectoris. Vasospasm is in turn related to cardiac arrhythmias, which may occur with ischemic heart disease during a variety of stressful experiences and during outbursts of anger. Finally, the role of stressful experience in inciting ischemic heart disease and its complications remains moot. 
5	Rupture of coronary vasa vasorum as a trigger of acute myocardial infarction. Some controversy has always existed regarding the presence and extent of the vasa vasorum--the nutrient vessels in the wall of the human aorta--in the coronary arteries. Now, cinemicrographic studies using silicone polymer injections in cleared human hearts have identified the vasa vasorum of coronary arteries, revealing evidence of neovascularization in the region of atherosclerotic plaques. These studies suggest an important role for the vasa vasorum in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis and its sequelae, especially intramural hemorrhage and vascular spasm. The wall of the human coronary artery in regions of atherosclerotic injury may be particularly rich in capillary vessels of the vasa vasorum. From this, the evidence suggests that with the morning increase in blood pressure, fragile neovascular structures of the vasa vasorum may be more prone to rupture and may be responsible, in part, for the circadian variation in myocardial infarction. 
5	Histologic evaluation of the width of soft tissue necrosis adjacent to carbon dioxide laser incisions. This study evaluated the width of tissue necrosis lateral to carbon dioxide laser incisions on human intraoral excisional biopsy specimens. Measurements were made on specimens including epithelium, muscle, dense and loose connective tissue, and salivary gland. Results showed a mean width of tissue necrosis of 86 microns in epithelium, 85 microns in muscle, 51 microns in loose connective tissue, 96 microns in dense connective tissue, and 41 microns in salivary gland. The range of thermal necrosis in different tissue types is probably based on the water content within each type. A cellular partially homogenized zone of reversible thermal damage up to 500 microns in width was visible adjacent to the zone of thermal necrosis. The relatively narrow width of tissue necrosis with this technique may account for the claimed superior properties of laser-induced wounds compared with those created by electrosurgery. 
3	Sleep disturbances in HIV-infected homosexual men. To provide a better understanding of the etiology of subjective sleep complaints in HIV-infected individuals, a study to evaluate sleep/wake disturbances in 10 healthy HIV-infected male volunteers was performed. All subjects were HIV-infected but had no history of AIDS-related infections, and considered clinically asymptomatic. Interviews and sleep questionnaires revealed sleep complaints in nine subjects. Five healthy HIV-seronegative male subjects, with no history of sleep complaints, were also evaluated. Sleep architecture analyses detected that, in comparison to published normative data and to negative controls, there was a significant increase in the total percentage of slow wave sleep (SWS) and an increase in the percentage of SWS in the later sleep cycles. When compared with normative data, an increase in stage 1 shifts, rapid eye movement (REM) periods, and arousals were also observed in the HIV-infected group. Significant decreases in sleep latency, total percentage stage 2 sleep, and average REM durations were also observed in the HIV-infected group compared with normative data. These sleep architecture abnormalities could not be attributed to known sole primary sleep disorders, first night effect, medications, anxiety or depression. This study indicates that sleep disturbances occur early in the course of HIV infection and suggests that the observed alterations of sleep physiology may be a consequence of central nervous system involvement and/or immune defense mobilization in the early phases of HIV infection. 
5	The role of cholecystokinin in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the isolated pancreas preparation. In a variety of animal models of acute pancreatitis, cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have ameliorated the injury response. These results suggest that cholecystokinin may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis initiated by multiple stimuli. In an effort to test this theory, a sensitive and high affinity cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L364,718 was administered to four different models of acute pancreatitis that were produced in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas preparation. The four models of pancreatitis were initiated by cerulein infusion, partial duct obstruction with secretin stimulation, oleic acid infusion, and a 2-hour period of ischemia. In each model, pancreatitis was manifest by edema formation, weight gain, and hyperamylasemia during a 4-hour perfusion. In cerulein infusion-induced pancreatitis L364,718 inhibited edema formation and weight gain (31 +/- 5 gm versus 7 +/- 6 gm; p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased plasma amylase activity (36,605 +/- 21,216 U/dl versus 9421 +/- 5149 U/dl; p less than 0.05). The acute pancreatitis induced by the other three stimuli was not ameliorated by L364,718 treatment. We conclude that in the ex vivo-perfused canine pancreas preparation cerulein-induced pancreatitis is mediated at least in part by the cholecystokinin receptor. Early blockade of the cholecystokinin receptor was of no benefit in treating the other models of pancreatitis, suggesting that cholecystokinin is not involved in the early pathogenesis. 
4	Quantification of the reversibility of stress-induced thallium-201 myocardial perfusion defects: a multicenter trial using bull's-eye polar maps and standard normal limits A multicenter trial was performed on 140 patients from four centers to determine the accuracy of quantitative analysis of stress/delayed thallium-201 myocardial tomograms using normal limits to assess the relative amount of reversibility of stress-induced defects. The patients were found to have 85 fixed and 124 reversible defects, as determined by visual interpretation. Reversibility bull's-eye polar maps were compared to gender-matched normal limits from 36 normals. Regions were identified as reversible if their normalized difference between stress and 4 hr greater than 1.5 s.d.s. from the mean normal limits. Overall agreement between experts at multicenter sites and reversibility maps was 73% for reversible defects and 80% of fixed defects. Sensitivity in detecting reversibility was highest for the left circumflex (88%) and lowest for the right coronary (60%). These results indicate that reversibility polar maps and normal limits offer an objective, accurate technique for determining the reversibility of stress-induced perfusion defects. 
3	Recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome after first rib resection. Seventy-seven patients with 84 operated limbs participated in a follow-up examination on an average of about six years after the resection of the first rib for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Forty-two limbs (50%) were totally asymptomatic one month after the operation and remained so for at least half a year postoperatively. In the follow-up examination, 31 limbs were still asymptomatic, whereas 11 limbs had the same symptoms as before the operation. Of the nine patients with recurrent TOS (two with bilateral resection), seven were women and two were men. These nine patients were on average 38 years old (range = 19 to 51 years) and their jobs consisted of monotonous desk work. Seven of 11 stumps of the first rib were subluxated disclosed by the cervical rotation-lateral-flexion test. The occurrence of a subluxated stump of the first rib in the group of asymptomatic patients was far lower, only 3% (p less than .001). Of the 42 patients with persistent problems, a subluxated stump was encountered in seven (17%). Results of this follow-up examination suggest that monotonous desk work is an important factor causing kinesiologic abnormalities in the thoracic aperture. This abnormal kinesiology contributes to the recurrence of TOS symptoms even after the resection of the first rib. 
4	Effect of hydralazine on the mesenteric vasculature of hypertensive rats. To test whether structural alterations observed in the mesenteric vasculature of Wistar-Kyoto spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were dependent on the presence of hypertension, male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive (WKY) rats were treated in utero and postnatally with hydralazine up to 28 weeks of age. Treated SHR, WKY, and untreated WKY rats had comparable blood pressures that were less than those of untreated SHR. Treatment altered the dimensions of the superior mesenteric, intermediate-sized, and small arteries of the mesenteric vasculature. In the case of the superior mesenteric artery and intermediate vessels, hydralazine treatment increased the lumen and medial cross-sectional areas of the arteries in WKY rats and slightly decreased both parameters in SHR. Within the small arteries, treatment significantly increased the lumen size in SHR but not WKY rats and had no significant effect on the media of the vessels. Despite the above alterations, the media-to-lumen cross-sectional area ratios remained significantly elevated in SHR over WKY rats in both the treated and control groups of animals within all classes of arteries. The results indicate that there is an inherent increase in the quantity of media surrounding the arteries of SHR when compared with WKY rats that cannot be abolished by normalizing the blood pressure in utero and postnatally with hydralazine treatment. In SHR, such changes persist not only in arteries that exhibit an increase in the media-to-lumen ratio before hypertension but also in the superior mesenteric artery in which an increase in the ratio occurs after hypertension development. 
3	Swimmer's migraine. Three cases of sudden, severe headache occurring during swimming are described. A 51-year-old female had been engaging in a swimming exercise for about 20 minutes when she suddenly experienced a pulsating headache in the parietotemporal region, accompanied by nausea. A few days later, she experienced a similar episode, again during swimming practice. A 45-year-old male developed a pulsating headache with nausea immediately after diving into a swimming pool, and had a similar attack during diving practice 1 week later. A 32-year-old male developed a pulsating headache accompanied by nausea while swimming in the sea. In all three cases, blood pressure, pulse rate, neurological findings, cervical spinal x-rays, brain CT scans, and hematological findings were normal and the outcome was good. Although these patients' headaches were diagnosed as benign exertional headache, pathophysiologically they appeared to resemble the headache associated with sexual activity. 
1	A comparative study of histopathology, hormone receptors, peanut lectin binding, Ki-67 immunostaining, and nucleolar organizer region-associated proteins in human breast cancer. The current study was performed on 71 cases of human female breast cancer and compares the results of five morphologic methods developed for the detection of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR), lectin Peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding sites, monoclonal antibody Ki-67 immunoreactivity, and the mean number of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR). All the parameters were evaluated on serial cryostat sections representative of a closely related, if not identical, neoplastic population. A significant positive correlation was found between the occurrence of estrogen, progesterone, and peanut receptors and between Ki-67 immunoreactivity, mean number of NOR, and mitotic index. Furthermore, ER, PgR, and PNA receptors showed a significant, inverse correlation with Ki-67 immunoreactivity, mitotic index, and mean number of Ag-NOR. These results provide further data that support the hypothesis that (1) progesterone and PNA receptors are estrogen-induced and indicate a metabolic response of the target cells to functioning estrogen receptors; (2) the mean number of NOR reflects the cell kinetics of the tumor; and (3) metabolic differentiation of neoplastic cells is inversely correlated to the proliferation index. 
5	Morbidity associated with incompletely erupted third molars in the line of mandibular fractures. A retrospective analysis of 105 mandibular fractures associated with incompletely erupted third molars was undertaken. It was found that there was no difference in the rates of complication if the teeth were retained or extracted, or if an open or closed reduction was performed. The combination of tooth retention with open reduction, however, shows a trend toward being the treatment most prone to postoperative complications. 
5	Grinspan's syndrome: a drug-induced phenomenon? Three cases of apparently drug-induced Grinspan's syndrome involving the triad of oral lichen planus, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are reported. Because drug therapy for diabetes mellitus and hypertension is capable of producing lichenoid reactions of the oral mucosa, the question arises as to whether Grinspan's syndrome is an iatrogenically induced syndrome. 
1	The use of bromodeoxyuridine cytokinetic studies as a prognostic indicator of cancer of the head and neck. Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease. This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies. Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology. A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study. The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made. 
1	Melanoma in pregnancy. The clinical course of malignant melanoma in pregnancy has been a subject of controversy, but current evidence indicates that it is similar to the clinical course in non-pregnant patients. Early detection and biopsy of localized disease is crucial because early treatment provides an excellent prognosis. Surgical excision is the primary therapy for this disease. As the primary care provider for many women in the reproductive age group, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to detect these lesions at their earliest stages when they are amenable to cure. Overall, maternal metastases to the fetus and placenta are very rare events and do not warrant elective termination based on the maternal diagnosis. However, a thorough examination of the infant and placenta should be done in all cases of melanoma complicating pregnancy. After treatment, long-term follow-up is recommended. Since most recurrences develop within 3 years after the diagnosis, it remains prudent to recommend that these patients avoid a subsequent pregnancy during this interval. 
1	High incidence of antibodies to HTLV-I tax in blood relatives of adult T cell leukemia patients. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process. Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors. To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax). For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05). The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs. 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005). Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection. Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain. 
5	Clustered tRNA genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeric DNA sequence repeats. The centromere-associated B' and B DNA sequence repeats of Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosomes I and II have been found to contain clusters of tRNA genes. The centromere II region (cen2) includes at least 22 tRNA genes distributed among five copies of the B sequence repeat containing genes specifying tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Val). Individual B repeats are variously associated with other tRNA genes, including those specifying tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Arg), and tRNA(Glu2). The centromere I region (cen1) contains at least six tRNA genes in two copies of the B' repeated element, including genes specifying tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Glu3). Multiple tandemly arranged clusters of tRNA genes are presumably conserved due to restricted recombination frequencies in the centromere regions. 
3	Intradural spinal cord tumor presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis. Negative findings on four-vessel angiography after a subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in 5 to 30% of patients. A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the ictus in a small percentage of this group. The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography. 
2	Gluten challenge in patients with celiac disease: evaluation of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Our aim in this study was to monitor changes of the intestinal structure by alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance (alpha 1-ATCL) in order to offer an alternative to the gluten challenge biopsy. In addition, we evaluated the possibility of reducing the time of gluten challenge. Twelve patients had a presumptive diagnosis of celiac disease based on clinical and histological grounds. They were studied when the jejunal histology was normal after gluten-free diet and an alpha 1-ATCL was normal. The gluten was introduced by returning to a normal diet. The challenge lasted 4 wk. We measured alpha 1-ATCL at the end of the 1st and 4th wk, and a new jejunal biopsy was obtained at the end of the 4th wk. By wk 1, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 11 patients but normal in one. By wk 4, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 10 patients and still normal in one. The post-challenge biopsies showed atrophy in 11 and was normal only in the patient with normal alpha 1-ATCL at wk 1 and 4. One patient with abnormal alpha 1-ATCL had to stop the challenge at the first week. The patient with normal clearance at wk 1 and 4 and normal biopsy at wk 4 had abnormal results at 6 months. These data support our hypothesis that alpha 1-ATCL can be used as evidence of gluten toxicity after gluten challenge, and that this test can be abnormal as early as 1 wk after gluten is reintroduced. 
5	The use of risk factors in medical diagnosis: opportunities and cautions. We discuss in this paper the extent to which disease risk factors may assist in the diagnostic process. We caution that disease risk factors need not be very sensitive or specific. Risk factor specificity and sensitivity may be further reduced if, in the former case, the risk factor is related to other illnesses having the same clinical presentation as the disease of interest, or if, in the latter case, the risk factor disappears with the onset of illness. We illustrate these points in a discussion of the utility of smoking as a diagnostic test for malignancy in two clinical situations, the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and the patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule. Risk factors hold great promise as aids to medical diagnosis, as this information is readily available to clinicians at little or no cost. Clinicians, however, should exercise caution when using risk factors of unproven diagnostic utility in medical diagnosis, as their presence may have little or no effect on disease probability. 
5	Management of postoperative inflammation: dexamethasone versus flurbiprofen, a quantitative study using the new Flare Cell Meter. A consecutive, random, prospective study was conducted to compare the effect of topical dexamethasone and flurbiprofen drops on postoperative inflammation in patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction with lens implantation. Objective, quantitative measurements were made postoperatively, using the Kowa FC-1000 Flare Cell Meter. The two treatments were equally effective. 
4	Klinefelter's syndrome with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare entity. Even rarer is an anomalous origin of the Left Main Coronary Artery. For both conditions to occur in the same patient is hence exceedingly rare. Reported here is a never previously reported case of a coronary congenital anomaly in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome together with the proper angiographic approach. 
4	Pulse oximetry: a new non-invasive assessment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Peripheral skin perfusion reflects the level of vascularity and viability of a limb and may help in planning the site of amputation or bypass surgery in patients with vascular disease. This study used peripheral pulse oximetry in 20 healthy volunteers and in 20 patients with limb ischaemia. Pulse oximetry saturation levels (Psa,O2) were compared with ankle artery Doppler pressures and transcutaneous oxygen measurements (Ptc,O2). Recordings were taken at two standard sites distally and referenced to finger and forearm to calculate an index. A significant correlation was found between Ptc,O2 and Psa,O2 in patients with ischaemia (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01). A further group of 12 patients with acute limb ischaemia was similarly assessed before and after revascularization. After revascularization mean(s.d.) Ptc,O2 increased from 38(13) to 44(1) mmHg (P greater than 0.05) and mean(s.d.) Psa,O2 increased from 86(3) to 90(4) per cent (P less than 0.01). These data suggest that pulse oximetry is a more sensitive index of peripheral perfusion than Ptc,O2 or ankle artery Doppler pressure and that, because of its accuracy and simplicity, it merits further use. 
4	Effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature in normal dogs and in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bipyridines or their derivatives may have a selective pulmonary vasodilation effect. METHODS: Preliminary study: milrinone administration to 12 normal dogs (low dose [bolus 75 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.75 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]; high dose [bolus 150 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 1.5 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]). Main study: milrinone administration to 18 dogs with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary embolism induced by a massive injection of autologous muscle cubes. The pulmonary hypertension dogs were divided into three groups: a) group E (n = 6) received embolization only, as control; b) group L (n = 6) received low-dose milrinone; and c) group H (n = 6) received high-dose milrinone, equivalent to the preliminary study group. Hemodynamic measurements and blood samplings were obtained at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min after start of milrinone infusion. RESULTS: Milrinone did not change mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in normal dogs. Milrinone decreased MPAP significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance index remained at an almost constant level in normal dogs, but decreased significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level in all groups. High-dose milrinone administration decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) significantly; low-dose milrinone administration decreased SVRI slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone may have a selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect only in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. The mechanism that produced a selectivity on pulmonary vasculature in dogs with pulmonary hypertension is unknown. However, an inhibition of platelet aggregation may decrease the MPAP resulting from an increase in cAMP caused by milrinone. Further studies are needed to resolve the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of milrinone in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. 
4	Effects of metoprolol on rest and exercise cardiac function and plasma catecholamines in chronic congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. To define the effects of 2 months of metoprolol therapy on cardiac function, aerobic performance and sympathetic nervous system activity, metoprolol (75 to 100 mg/day) was administered to 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Metoprolol was discontinued in 2 patients because of worsening CHF. In the remaining 8 patients, peak oxygen uptake increased significantly (14.8 +/- 3.0 to 16.1 +/- 2.5 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.05) as did the oxygen pulse (9.0 +/- 2.2 to 12.6 +/- 1.8 ml/beat, p less than 0.02). Resting heart rate (87 +/- 18 to 62 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and peak exercise heart rate (133 +/- 13 to 105 +/- 30 beats/min, p less than 0.02) were both reduced. Mean resting ejection fraction increased from 0.15 +/- 0.06 to 0.25 +/- 0.11 and peak exercise ejection fraction also tended to increase (0.19 +/- 0.11 to 0.28 +/- 0.15, difference not significant). Both resting plasma norepinephrine (613 +/- 706 to 303 +/- 142 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) and epinephrine (71 +/- 50 to 40 +/- 21 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) were reduced. Circulating lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor number was unchanged (1,334 +/- 292 to 1,344 +/- 456 receptors/cell, difference not significant). It is concluded that metoprolol therapy is associated with improvements in rest and exercise ventricular performance and maximal aerobic capacity. These improvements are associated with a decline in resting sympathetic nervous system activity. 
5	Benefit of bicarbonate dialysis during CAVHD. The effect of bicarbonate dialysate (BD) on acid-base status in six pediatric CAVHD patients was examined during seven episodes of metabolic acidosis. When metabolic acidosis was not corrected with CAVHD, a sterile BD was substituted for either acetate- or lactate-based dialysate. Pre- and post-BD substitution levels of lactate, HCO3, PCO2, anion gap, and pH were recorded, as well as dose of intravenous (i.v.) bicarbonate. Improvements in pH and serum HCO3 were seen in all seven cases. Anion gap decreased in all but one of the patients who were switched from lactate to bicarbonate dialysate, with improvement most marked in those patients with marked elevation of the anion gap. No adverse effect on PCO2 was noted. Lactate dialysate may be less effective when serum lactate levels are high, and may contribute to further elevation of lactate levels and anion gap. These data suggest that bicarbonate dialysate may be preferable to lactate or acetate dialysate in CAVHD patients with persistent metabolic acidosis. 
2	Ascending cholangitis: surgery versus endoscopic or percutaneous drainage. A retrospective review of 61 patients with calculous cholangitis was carried out. There were 31 men and 30 women and their mean age was 75.8 years. All patients had abdominal pain, 87% had chills and fever, 65% had clinical jaundice, 23% were in shock, and 54% had positive blood cultures. Because intravenous hydration and antibiotics did not help, 33 patients underwent surgery, 25 patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy (EP), and three patients underwent percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct (PTD). Morbidity in the surgery group included two wound infections, one respiratory failure, and one renal failure. Morbidity in the EP-PTD group was one case of arterial bleeding requiring surgery and one of pancreatitis treated conservatively. Two patients (6%) died in the surgery group, one of sepsis and the other of cardiorespiratory arrest. In the EP-PTD group nine patients (32%) died of sepsis and multisystem organ failure. These patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery and thus repeat EP-PTD was carried out. Cholangitis persisted, and retained common bile duct stones with sepsis was the cause of death. Thus when initial EP or PTD is unsuccessful, surgical exploration of the common bile duct should be carried out to control sepsis. 
3	Meningitis in the neurosurgical patient. In the patient with a basilar skull fracture and CSF leak, the risk of meningitis is greatly increased. The diagnosis of both leak and infection can be obscured by the patient's other injuries, and requires aggressive investigation of symptoms that suggest infection. Although the diagnosis is made with CSF cultures, when clinically suspected, treatment should begin after appropriate cultures have been obtained. Treatment should be directed against the most likely organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and the other organisms common to the upper respiratory tract. There are no good indications for prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with known CSF leaks. The patient with a shunt or other CNS prosthetic device may have various manifestations of infection, depending on the type of device and its termination. Frank meningitis or ventriculitis is not always present. Diagnosis requires direct culturing of the shunt milieu, with the most frequent isolates being staphylococcal species and gram-negative enteric bacilli. The most effective therapy, for both eradication of the infection and minimization of the duration and morbidity of therapy, involves removal of the infected shunt, external drainage during parenteral antibiotic therapy, and complete replacement of hardware at the time of internalization. The postsurgical patient will not develop meningitis very frequently, but like the posttrauma patient, concurrent factors can make the diagnosis difficult. Differentiating infectious from chemical meningitis must often be initially based on CSF cell counts and chemistries alone. Treatment to cover the most likely organism, staphylococcal species and respiratory flora, should be started before the culture results are finalized. 
5	Childhood deaths from toy balloons. We describe four children who died of suffocation by rubber balloons in Canada between 1983 and 1988. In the United States, at least 121 children have died in a similar manner in the 15 years between 1973 and 1988 according to a report by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although the highest mortality occurred among infants, 30 (25%) of the 121 deaths occurred in children 6 years of age or older. Balloons account for 43% of the approximately 15 childhood deaths related to children's products that are documented each year by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Toy rubber balloons are thus the leading cause of pediatric choking deaths from children's products. Preventive efforts should be directed toward a ban on this type of balloon and the development of safer alternatives. Meanwhile, public information campaigns should alert parents, physicians, and policymakers to the dangers of toy rubber balloons. 
1	Impact of enucleation for choroidal melanoma on the performance of vision-dependent activities. We report a functional outcome assessment of 71 patients who underwent enucleation for choroidal melanoma. Each was interviewed to evaluate his her self-reported ability to perform four vision-dependent activities--working, driving, reading, and television viewing--before enucleation and when interviewed. The interval between enucleation and the interview varied between 2 and 25 years. Eighty-seven percent (62/71) reported no change in their ability to perform these important vision-dependent tasks. At 15 years after enucleation, 90% (18/20) retained the ability to drive and 96% (25/26) retained the ability to read. These results are reassuring for those with choroidal melanoma who are faced with enucleation, because most of these patients seem likely to continue at a level of visual function comparable with their preenucleation status. 
4	Clinical and anatomic considerations for surgery in femoropopliteal disease and the results of surgery. From 1980 to 1988 we performed 288 femoropopliteal bypass operations in 231 patients at the Oregon Health Sciences University. The indication for the procedure was claudication in 31% and the relief of limb-threatening ischemia in 64%. Operative mortality occurred after four of these operations (1.4%), including three deaths from myocardial infarction and one death from stroke. The femoropopliteal bypass patients were divided into groups for patency analysis, including those undergoing bypass surgery with a good quality greater saphenous vein versus alternate bypass conduits and patients undergoing primary limb bypass versus those undergoing repeat bypass after prior bypass failure. Our overall primary graft patency for all femoropopliteal grafts was 79% at 5 years. Patients undergoing bypass with a good quality greater saphenous vein had primary graft patency of 85% at 5 years. Patients undergoing bypass using a conduit other than greater saphenous vein had a 5-year patency of 73%. Patients undergoing repeat bypass after a prior failed bypass had a 5-year patency of 57%. 
4	Elapsed time from symptom onset and acute myocardial infarction in a community hospital. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have emphasized that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction should be initiated within three or four hours of symptom onset to obtain the best clinical outcomes. However, our clinical impression was that late arrivers, who often do not receive thrombolytic therapy, have a good short-term prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the relationships among the elapsed time from symptom onset, thrombolytic therapy, and short-term prognosis in acute myocardial infarction patients. The research hypothesis was that late arrivers have a better in-hospital prognosis because they have less severe disease that may involve spontaneous thrombolysis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study based on reviewing medical records and emergency department service logs. SETTING: 500-bed teaching hospital with medical school affiliation in northeastern Ohio. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred consecutive patients with acute infarction confirmed by chest pain and positive ECGs or elevated cardiac enzymes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients arriving early (elapsed time less than or equal to 1.5 hours) were more likely to be in Killip class III or IV (P = .04) or to have hypotension (P = .0004); and they experienced twofold increased odds of ventricular tachycardia (P = .007), cardiac arrest (P = .03), or death (P = .01). Patients arriving late (elapsed time greater than 3.5 hours) were more likely to have a history of angina (P = .002) and had a better short-term prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Time of ED arrival after onset of acute myocardial infarction symptoms distinguishes two patient groups that differ in their risk of in-hospital complications. Late arrivers have better short-term prognoses and less (acutely) severe disease, and may have less need for thrombolytic therapy because of possible spontaneous thrombolysis. Patients with prior angina may need education on seeking care if their symptoms change. 
5	Prostate cancer: transrectal ultrasound and pathology comparison. A preliminary study of outer gland (peripheral and central zones) and inner gland (transition zone) cancer. A study was conducted to compare results of transrectal ultrasound with pathologic findings on 116 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer. In 96% (111 of 116), transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies of a hypoechoic lesion proved cancer; seven patients had known Stage A cancer; one patient had cancer detected by palpation and not detected by ultrasound. Cancers in the outer gland (peripheral and central zones) were compared with cancers in the inner gland (transition zone) by both ultrasound and pathology. Forty-eight percent (52 of 108) of cancers originating in the outer gland showed extraprostatic extension (Stage C disease). The primary sites of tumor escape from the outer gland were the prostatic capsule (38%), anterior fibromuscular stroma (5%), seminal vesicle (18%), the base of the gland at the neurovascular bundle (21%), and the apex (31%). Twenty-two percent (17 of 54) of cancers originating in the inner gland (transition zone) showed extraprostatic extension (Stage C disease). The primary sites of tumor escape from the inner gland were the anterior fibromuscular stroma (6%) and apex (11%). Both histologic and biologic differences between outer and inner gland cancers were found when tumor size was controlled. Gleason scores were significantly different for inner and outer gland cancers, with mean scores of 6.2 +/- 1.6 and 7.4 +/- 0.9, respectively. An odds ratio of 8.6 confirmed the increased risk of extraprostatic extension for outer gland cancer. Outer gland cancers showed increased aggressive behavior of both histologic and biologic nature. The difference in biologic aggressiveness of outer and inner gland cancers has definite implications for treatment options. Use of other diagnostic parameters, such as DNA ploidy, may help to determine which cancers to treat and when to treat them; this may have more relevance for cancers originating in the inner gland. Strategic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy affords accurate tumor mapping and staging when modes of internal spread and escape of cancer from both outer and inner gland are known. Thus, transrectal ultrasound may be our "window of observation" through which additional research may explain the histologic and biologic discrepancies between outer and inner gland cancers. 
5	Primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with psoriasis. Between 1976 and 1988, 50 primary total knee arthroplasties were performed on 34 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. The skin lesions were graded for severity in all patients and the extent of affected body surface was mapped. All patients received peri-operative antibiotics. Only one deep infection, with Staphylococcus aureus, occurred 25 months after operation. The average length of follow-up was nearly four and a half years, being to a minimum of two years or until failure of the arthroplasty. There appears to be no increased risk of deep infection in patient with psoriasis vulgaris undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty. 
4	Adjacent solid boundaries alter the size of regurgitant jets on Doppler color flow maps. Recent studies have attempted to predict the severity of regurgitant lesions from jet size on Doppler flow maps. Jet size is a function of both regurgitant volume and fluid entrained from the receiving chamber and, for a free jet, is a function of its momentum at the orifice. However, regurgitant jets often approach or attach to cardiac walls, potentially altering their momentum and ability to expand by entrainment. Therefore, this study addressed the hypothesis that adjacent walls influence regurgitant jet size as seen on Doppler flow maps. Steady flow was driven through circular orifices (0.02 to 0.05 cm2) at physiologic velocities of 2 to 5 m/s. At a constant flow rate and orifice velocity, orifice position was varied to produce three jet geometries: free jets, jets adjacent to a horizontal chamber wall lying 1 cm below the orifice and wall jets with the orifice at the level of the wall. Doppler color flow imaging was performed at identical instrument settings for all jets. Two long-axis views of the jet were obtained: a vertical view perpendicular to the wall, resembling that most commonly used in patients to image the length of the jet, and a horizontal view parallel to the chamber wall. Velocities along the jet were also measured by Doppler mapping. 
1	Primary non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the esophagus. A case with peculiar endoscopic ultrasonographic pattern. We report a case of primary esophageal non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma in a young white female. At admission, endoscopy revealed large, irregularly shaped, esophageal ulcerations with super imposed candidiasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography to assess submucosal alterations and periesophageal involvement revealed a diffuse hypoechogenic thickening (up to 5 mm) of the esophageal wall, a pattern consistent with lymphomatous infiltration. Definitive diagnosis was made with the aid of histology and immunohistochemistry. 
1	Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms. Report on experience with 504 specimens. Intraoperative pathologic examination with frozen section (FS) was performed on 504 specimens of thyroid tissue obtained from 457 patients over a period of 9 years. After examination of permanent sections (PS) a malignant neoplasm was diagnosed in 57 specimens (11.3%); 50 (87%) of these were primary thyroid carcinoma, four (8%) metastatic carcinoma, and three (5%) malignant lymphoma. The FS diagnosis was "benign" in 448 (88.9%), "malignant" in (30) 5.9%, and "deferred" in 26 (5.2%). The sensitivity of FS diagnosis of malignancy was 53% and the specificity and positive predictive value 100%. The negative predictive value was 97.8% and overall accuracy 97.9%. The PS disclosed a malignant neoplasm in 62% of specimens in which FS diagnosis was "deferred." Sixty-eight percent of papillary carcinomas, 87% of undifferentiated carcinomas, and a single case of medullary carcinoma were diagnosed with FS examination. A FS diagnosis of malignancy was not made in any of the ten specimens containing follicular carcinoma; in all ten the neoplasms were well-differentiated and eight were encapsulated and minimally invasive. The inability to diagnose follicular carcinoma intraoperatively with FS is the most significant factor accounting for the relatively low sensitivity of FS diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasms. 
1	Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of laparoscopy in patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and a normal computerized tomograph (CT). Twenty-five consecutive patients with a normal liver and no peritoneal lesions on CT were evaluated. Patients with a documented primary neoplasm or a positive ascitic fluid cytology were excluded. At laparoscopy, malignancy was documented by biopsy in 12 patients for an incidence of 48%. Of the patients with exudative ascites, 75% had peritoneal metastases. In addition seven patients had benign liver disease documented by laparoscopic biopsy. Liver enzymes were not helpful in distinguishing benign and malignant disease in this group of patients. This study indicates that a negative CT does not exclude liver or peritoneal malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT suspected of having hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients. 
4	Cardiotoxicity of interferon. A review of 44 cases. Cardiovascular complications have occurred in clinical trials of interferon. We review herein experience to date of cardiotoxicity with all types of interferons in cancer patients. The most common presentations of cardiotoxicity were cardiac arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction and sudden death. The cardiac effects were not related to the daily dose, cumulative total dose, or period of therapy. Some of the patients in whom interferon has caused cardiovascular sequelae have had a history of coronary heart disease or have previously been given chemotherapy with drugs known to be cardiotoxic. In most of the patients, cardiac toxicity was reversible following the cessation of the drug therapy. 
2	Ranitidine in the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug associated gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a multicentre study the effect of ranitidine on healing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) associated peptic ulcers was compared in a group of patients who had stopped NSAID treatment with another group who continued with NSAID treatment. A total of 190 patients with confirmed ulcers were randomised to continue or stop NSAID treatment. All patients in addition received ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Patients were endoscopically monitored at four, eight, and 12 weeks. Gastric ulcers at eight weeks had healed in 63% of those taking NSAIDs compared with 95% of those who had stopped NSAID treatment. For duodenal ulcer the healing rates at eight weeks were 84% in the group continuing NSAIDs compared with 100% in those who stopped NSAIDs. The differences in healing rates were statistically significant for both gastric ulcer (p = 0.001) and for duodenal ulcer (p = 0.006). At 12 weeks, 79% of gastric ulcers and 92% of duodenal ulcers were healed in the group continuing with NSAIDs. All patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers who stopped taking NSAIDs were healed at 12 weeks. The study shows that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily effectively heals NSAID associated peptic ulcers. Healing is more successful when NSAID treatment stops but even if these drugs are continued, substantial healing rates are achievable. 
4	Repair of flail anterior leaflets of tricuspid and mitral valves by cusp remodeling. We present an alternative approach to extensive rupture of the chordae tendineae leading to flail anterior leaflets. Resection of the affected cusp segment, suture of the cut edges, and extensive plication of the segment of annulus devoid of leaflets abolished massive regurgitation while maintaining an adequate valve orifice. 
2	GI symptoms, function, and psychophysiological arousal in dysmenorrheic women. In a previous study, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and stool characteristics were found to be influenced by menstrual cycle phase. The current study was designed to replicate initial work regarding GI symptoms and stool characteristics and to explore the relationships between GI symptoms, stool characteristics, ovarian hormone levels, and indicators of psychophysiological arousal. Fifty women (dysmenorrheic, N = 22; nondysmenorrheic, N = 28) maintained a daily dairy for recording stool characteristics, GI symptoms, and daily anxiety level. First morning void urine specimens for catecholamine assays and serum samples for ovarian hormone and cortisol determinations were obtained at menses, follicular, and luteal phases. Results showed menstrual cycle-related differences in stool characteristics and report of GI symptoms, with the greatest changes occurring at menses in the total sample. Dysmenorrheic women reported higher levels of all GI symptoms at menses as compared to nondysmenorrheic women. In addition, cycle-related differences in serum cortisol, urine catecholamines, and report of anxiety were also noted, particularly in dysmenorrheic women. However, looser stools and GI symptoms at menses were not correlated with absolute levels of ovarian hormones or indicators of psychophysiological arousal. 
1	Clinical features and natural history of von Hippel-Lindau disease The clinical features, age at onset and survival of 152 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease were studied. Mean age at onset was 26.3 years and 97 per cent of patients had presented by aged 60 years. Retinal angioma was the first manifestation in 65 patients (43 per cent), followed by cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 60, 39 per cent) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 15, 10 per cent). Overall, 89 patients (59 per cent) developed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, 89 (59 per cent) a retinal angioma, 43 (28 per cent) renal cell carcinoma, 20 (13 per cent) spinal haemangioblastoma and 11 (7 per cent) a phaeochromocytoma. Renal, pancreatic and epididymal cysts were frequent findings but their exact incidence was not accurately assessed. Mean age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (44.0 +/- 10.9 years) was significantly older than that for cerebellar haemangioblastoma (29.0 +/- 10.0 years) and retinal angioma (25.4 +/- 12.7 years). The probability of a patient with von Hippel-Lindan disease developing a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, retinal angioma or renal cell carcinoma by age 60 years was 0.84, 0.7 and 0.69, respectively. A comprehensive screening protocol for affected patients and at-risk relatives is presented, based on detailed analysis of age at onset data for each of the major complications. Median actuarial survival was 49 years, with renal cell carcinoma the leading cause of death. 
3	Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect. 
1	Tumor-secreted vascular permeability factor increases cytosolic Ca2+ and von Willebrand factor release in human endothelial cells. Vascular permeability factor (VPF), a tumor-secreted heparin-binding protein (Mr approximately 38,000), is responsible for increased vessel permeability and fluid accumulation associated with tumor growth. Vascular permeability factor also promotes the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and bovine pulmonary ECs in vitro. It is shown for the first time that guinea pig VPF (half-maximal and maximal dose approximately 0.4 and 22 pmol/l (picomolar), respectively), as well as human VPF, are potent stimuli for human ECs resulting in [Ca2+]i increases (maximal three- to fourfold) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Unlike the maximal responses to thrombin and histamine, the [Ca2+]i response to a maximal VPF dose was preceded by a characteristic 10- to 15-second delay. Guinea pig VPF also selectively increased [Ca2+]i in cultured aortic and pulmonary artery ECs, but not aortic smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts, or neutrophils. Affinity-purified rabbit antibody (raised to a synthetic peptide representing VPF N-terminal amino acids 1 to 24) adsorbed all vessel permeability-increasing activity, EC growth-promoting activity, and specifically all activity responsible for increasing EC [Ca2+]i. Similar to other mediators that increase [Ca2+]i in cultured ECs, VPF also induced a 200% increase in von Willebrand factor release. Together these data indicate that VPF acts directly on ECs and that rapid cellular events in its in vivo/in vitro actions are likely to involve phospholipase C activation, [Ca2+]i increase, and von Willebrand factor release. 
4	Plasma prolactin and clinical outcome in preterm infants. Plasma prolactin was measured weekly in 280 preterm infants. The complex gestational age dependent pattern of postnatal prolactin release has been defined and reference standards provided. Plasma prolactin was higher in girls, with increasing divergence between the sexes from the third week onwards, and higher after two weeks, in infants of mothers with pregnancy related hypertension. Diet, assigned randomly, exerted a major effect on plasma prolactin, with significantly higher values in infants fed donor breast milk or standard formula than in those fed a protein, energy, and mineral enriched preterm formula. After adjusting for confounding factors, infants with the lowest plasma prolactin concentrations (less than 1000 mU/l, 32.9 micrograms/l) occurring usually at a nadir between days 5 and 12, showed a 120% increase in the duration of ventilatory assistance required, a 20% increase in the number of days to attain full enteral feeds, and a 30% decrease in length gain. We suggest preterm birth disrupts the normal perinatal pattern of prolactin release and that those infants who develop relatively low plasma concentration have an adverse outcome. Our data add to the broader debate on whether preterm infants require multiple endocrine replacement treatment. 
1	Aggressive primary gastrointestinal lymphomas: review of 91 patients treated with the LNH-84 regimen. A study of the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Agressifs. PURPOSE: Patients with aggressive primary gastrointestinal lymphoma undergoing the LNH-84 chemotherapy regimen were analyzed to determine the efficacy of intensive combination chemotherapy, the role of surgical debulking in patients treated with combination chemotherapy, and the toxicity associated with each of these modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-one patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma who participated in the prospective multicenter LNH-84 combination chemotherapy trial (total number of patients in trial, 737) were analyzed. These 91 patients included 69 (76%) with diffuse large cell, nine (10%) with diffuse mixed, and seven (8%) with small noncleaved cell lymphoma. Two patients (2%) had stage IE, 54 patients (59%) stage IIE, and 35 patients (38%) stage IV disease; all patients with stage IE, 22 with stage IIE, and 18 with stage IV disease had bulky (greater than or equal to 10 cm) tumors. Specific sites of gastrointestinal involvement included stomach (47%), small bowel (38%), ileocecum (14%), colon (11%), and rectum (7%). Although surgical resection was attempted in 71 patients (78%), only 28 (31%) had complete tumor excision. All patients received three or four cycles of ACVB (defined in text) induction therapy followed by sequential consolidation as previously described. RESULTS: Responses to treatment in the 91 patients included 71 (78%) complete remissions, six (7%) partial remissions, five (5%) nonresponses, and nine (10%) deaths. With a median follow-up of 3 years, 10 patients (14%) have had relapses; predicted 4-year disease-free survival of complete responders is 85% and predicted 4-year survival of the entire group is 62%. In patients with stage IE or IIE disease, the complete response, survival, and disease-free survival rates were similar in those who underwent complete surgical resection or incomplete or no surgical resection prior to the administration of combination chemotherapy. Prognostic factors predicting for survival in the 91 patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma were similar to those in the 646 other patients treated with the LNH-84 regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aggressive gastrointestinal lymphoma treated with intensive chemotherapy have outcomes and prognostic factors comparable to those of patients with similar-stage aggressive lymphoma without primary gastrointestinal involvement. Surgical resection prior to the administration of combination chemotherapy did not influence the complete response rate, survival rate, or disease-free survival rate in this small group of patients. 
4	Pulmonary artery balloon counterpulsation for intraoperative right ventricular failure. Two cases of severe low cardiac output and right ventricular failure after coronary artery bypass grafting necessitated pulmonary artery balloon counterpulsation after intraaortic balloon pumping and maximal inotropic/pressor support were unsuccessful in maintaining a satisfactory cardiac output. Hemodynamic improvement was sufficient to allow removal of the device 2 and 3 days postoperatively, with survival in 1 patient. Pulmonary artery counterpulsation is less morbid in comparison with other mechanical methods of right ventricular support and is applicable in right ventricular failure of intermediate severity. 
2	Piezoelectric lithotripsy: stone disintegration and follow-up results in patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones. One hundred symptomatic patients with radiolucent gallbladder stones were treated with a new piezoelectric lithotripter and oral chemolitholytic agents. Stone disintegration was achieved in 99 of these patients (99%) with a mean (+/- SD) maximum fragment size of 5.1 +/- 4.1 mm. Significant differences were found when the mean (+/- SD) fragment sizes of single stones less than or equal to 20 mm (4.2 +/- 2.5 mm) were compared with those of single stones greater than 20 mm (5.8 +/- 3.4 mm; P less than 0.05) and multiple stones (6.2 +/- 3.8 mm; P less than 0.05), respectively. None of the patients required anesthesia, analgesics, or sedatives before or during the treatment. The stone-free rates for all patients followed up for up to 4-12 months (mean +/- SD, 10.7 +/- 2.9 months) were 18% (1 month), 25% (2 months), 38% (4 months), 52% (8 months), and 67% (12 months). Partly significant differences were obtained in stone-free rates for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm) compared with larger stones (greater than 20 mm) and multiple stones (P less than 0.05), respectively. Serious adverse reactions (i.e., cholestasis and pancreatitis) were observed in only 3 patients (3%). These conditions were induced by fragment impaction in the common bile duct. In 2 of these patients, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy was required. It is concluded that piezoelectrically generated shock waves are suitable for the effective and safe disintegration of gallbladder stones in humans. The anesthesia-free and analgesia-free shock-wave application opens up the possibility to perform biliary lithotripsy as an outpatient procedure. The stone-free rate achieved in combination with oral bile acids is most promising for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm). 
4	Intrapericardial extralobar pulmonary sequestration in a neonate. A huge pericardial effusion was diagnosed during fetal ultrasound examination performed in the 42nd week of pregnancy on a healthy 25-year-old woman. Immediately after the birth, a two-dimensional echocardiogram confirmed this finding in the infant, and an intrapericardial kidney-shaped solid mass measuring 45 x 56 x 15 mm, completely surrounded by pericardial effusion, was visualized to the left part of the heart. The heart was normal. No signs of cardiac tamponade were seen. At the age of two days, the mass was surgically resected and the pericardial fluid evacuated. Microscopic examination revealed that the mass was formed totally of normal lung tissue surrounded by normal pleura. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of intrapericardial extralobar sequestration consisting of an accessory lung with completely normal lung tissue. 
4	Noncoordinate regulation of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor coupling and reexpression of alpha skeletal actin in myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure in rats. To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the regulation of surface alpha-1 adrenoreceptors and signal transduction, large infarcts were produced in rats and the animals killed seven days later. After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium. Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts. Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium. Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle. In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics. The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium. 
5	Unusual cause of 'piriformis muscle syndrome'. The piriformis muscle syndrome is a controversial "clinical" syndrome primarily characterized by signs and symptoms of sciatic nerve compression at the region of the piriformis muscle as it passes through the greater sciatic notch. The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle. The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed. 
1	Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. 
5	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the circulatory support of children after repair of congenital heart disease. We have treated 39 infants and children with congenital heart disease with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the past 5 years. Thirty-six were treated for low cardiac output or pulmonary vasoreactive crisis after repair of congenital heart defects. Twenty-two (61%) survived. Most patients were cannulated from the neck via the right internal jugular vein and the right common carotid artery. Six patients were cannulated from the chest, including three who had separate drainage of the left side of the heart with a left atrial cannula. Two of these patients survived and were the only survivors of the nine patients cannulated in the operating room because they could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass after open cardiac operations. We also reviewed 312 patients (the predictor study series) having open cardiac operations before the availability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 27 of these patients died. Data were collected at 1 and 8 hours postoperatively to determine if any parameters might predict early mortality. With these parameters used as criteria, patients who went on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were as sick as those who died before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was available. The most common complication was bleeding related to heparinization. The mean transfusion requirement in survivors was 1.50 +/- 1.13 ml/kg/hr, 5.63 +/- 7.0 ml/kg/hr in the nonsurvivors, and 7.46 +/- 8.29 ml/kg/hr in those cannulated in the operating room because they could not be weaned from bypass. Four children had intracranial hemorrhage, and two of them died. There was one late death. Nine of the 22 survivors are entirely normal. All survivors who do not have Down's syndrome are considered to have normal central nervous system function. We conclude that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can improve survival in patients with both pulmonary artery hypertension and low cardiac output after operations for congenital heart disease. 
3	Status epilepticus in infancy and childhood. Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes. Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit. Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled. 
5	Abscess of the sphenoid sinus after transsphenoidal surgery. A case of a bacterial abscess developing in the sphenoid sinus 2 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery is presented. Although abscesses within the sella turcica have been reported as rare complications of transsphenoidal surgery, this is the first reported case of the postoperative formation of an abscess of the sphenoid sinus. The patient sought treatment for severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, and marked temperature elevation. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated soft tissue and air within the sphenoid sinus. A regimen of stress doses of hydrocortisone and antibiotics was prescribed, and the patient underwent transsphenoidal drainage of the sphenoid sinus. The sella turcica was not involved. Anaerobic cultures were positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum. 
5	Trapped-lung syndrome after cardiac surgery: a potentially preventable complication of pleural injury. A case of trapped-lung syndrome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is presented. A significant pleural injury occurred during the bypass operation resulting in intrapleural hemorrhage, pleural fibrosis, and trapped-lung syndrome. The physicians caring for the patient when she was first seen with the trapped-lung syndrome were unaware of the potential relationship between the two prior bypass surgeries to this pulmonary complication. Recognition of the potential for pleural injury to occur after cardiac operations is important and may allow for earlier diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapeutic interventions. Early recognition and treatment with pleural fluid drainage and reexpansion of the collapsed lung may help prevent this potentially serious pleuropulmonary complication from occurring. In addition, the presentation of this pleuropulmonary complication may be delayed after the cardiac surgery, making early diagnosis more problematic. 
5	Mast cell heterogeneity in chronic idiopathic urticaria. Patients with chronic urticaria are more sensitive to codeine skin testing than other allergic individuals. Nonlesional skin in most patients with chronic urticaria was found to contain increased numbers of both total and atypical mast cells. The presence of increased mast cell density was found to correlate with the degree of clinical (dermatographism) and functional (codeine skin test) skin sensitivity. 
5	Combined hemorrhagic shock and head injury: effects of hypertonic saline (7.5%) resuscitation. Hypertonic saline resuscitation was compared to isotonic fluid resuscitation in a large animal model combining hemorrhagic shock with head injury. Sheep were subjected to a freeze injury of one cerebral hemisphere as well as 2 hours of hypotension at a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg. Resuscitation was then carried out (MAP = 80 mm Hg) for 1 hour with either lactated Ringer's (LR, n = 6) or 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS, n = 6). Hemodynamic parameters and intracranial pressure (ICP) were followed. At the end of resuscitation brain water content was determined in injured and uninjured hemispheres. No differences were detected in cardiovascular parameters; however, ICPs were lower in animals resuscitated with HS (4.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) compared to LR (15.2 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Additionally, brain water content (ml H2O/gm dry weight) in uninjured brain hemispheres was lower after HS resuscitation (HS = 3.3 +/- 0.1; LR = 4.0 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.05). No differences were detected in the injured hemispheres. We conclude that hypertonic saline abolishes increases in ICP seen during resuscitation in a model combining hemorrhagic shock with brain injury by dehydrating areas where the blood-brain barrier is still intact. Hypertonic saline may prove useful in the early management of multiple trauma patients. 
1	Diagnosis of thymoma in myasthenics using anti-striated muscle antibodies: predictive value and gain in diagnostic certainty. Assay of anti-striated muscle antibodies (StrAb) is used as a diagnostic test for thymoma in individuals with myasthenia gravis. Unfortunately, false positive results are common, and their effect on test accuracy is magnified by the relatively low frequency of thymoma in myasthenics. We estimated the predictive values of positive and negative StrAb assays (PV+ and PV-) and gain in diagnostic certainty using values for sensitivity, specificity, and thymoma frequency previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence assays ranged from 0.83 to 0.84 (pooled estimate = 0.84; n = 68). Specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.88 (pooled estimate = 0.77; n = 898). Frequency of thymoma ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 (pooled estimate = 0.12; n = 4,515). The expected gain in diagnostic certainty from StrAb was minimal in those aged 0 to 20 and those aged 60+. In those aged 20 to 60, a negative test helped to exclude thymoma, and a positive test raised diagnostic suspicion but was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of thymoma (PV+ = 0.46). 
5	Unusual posterior retinal holes associated with high myopia in XYY syndrome. A 49-year-old XYY man was found to have high myopia OU with unusual multiple retinal atrophic holes located in the posterior pole, unrelated to a posterior staphyloma or any other myopic degenerative changes. Most of the retinal holes showed signs of self-healing, with no evidence of vitreous traction or retinal detachment. High myopia and atrophic retinal holes have been found in other chromosomal disorders and in one sex-chromosomal abnormality. 
5	The surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails. Two prospective studies of ingrowing toenail management were conducted. In the first, 163 patients (204 ingrowing nail edges) who had not had previous surgery were randomised and treated by total nail avulsion, nail edge excision, or nail edge excision with phenolisation of the germinal matrix; recurrence rates one year postoperatively were 73%, 73% and 9% respectively. In the second study, 63 ingrowing nail edges which had recurred after previous operations underwent nail edge excision and phenolisation. There was a 5% recurrence rate and 5% incidence of dystrophy of the nail one year after operation. 
4	New horizons in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. The application of recombinant DNA methodology to clinical medicine offers the clinician a new generation of more potent and specific therapies. Recombinant methods offer great promise in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. This review focuses on the characterization of 1) molecules that activate plasminogen locally (in the vicinity of a thrombus) rather than systemically, and 2) molecules that offer new approaches to the inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin activity. We first describe the methods used to uncover these molecules and their characterization at the molecular level. The ways in which this knowledge can lead to the development of agents tailored to clinical needs are then explored. 
5	Primary inflammatory reaction in synovial fluid and tissue in rabbit immobilization osteoarthritis. The kinetics and composition of the primary cellular inflammatory process were studied in the synovial fluid (SF) and synovial tissue (ST) compartments of a rabbit knee immobilization osteoarthritis model. Immobilization induced rapid migration of neutrophils (59% +/- 26% of all cells) into SF in three days, which was accompanied by nonspecific esterase-positive monocytes (71% +/- 8% of all mononuclear cells). This finding suggests that non-specific inflammation mediated by phagocytic leukocytes predominates the cellular response in the SF compartment. In contrast, morphometric analysis of ST proper showed an inflammatory mononuclear cell response, the intensity of which diminished over time during the study period from Day 3 (416 +/- 59 cells per 0.049 mm2 ST tissue) through Day 10 (305 +/- 32 cells) to Day 35 (174 +/- 36 cells). A dotlike T-pattern alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) was found in the T-cell-dependent areas of secondary lymphatic tissue in the spleen, enabling immunocytologic ANAE marker studies. The ST response in situ was predominated by tissue macrophage, though infiltrates rich in T lymphocytes were present in the immediate sublining stroma. There was a significant correlation between the intensity of the SF cell response (total recovery) and the percentage of neutrophils, but there was no correlation between the intensity of the ST response and the proportion of T lymphocytes. These T-cell accumulations together with the local proliferation of fibroblastlike lining cells and stromal fibroblasts suggest that the primary inflammatory cell response is not caused by either wear and tear or mechanically by cartilage fragments. 
1	Central neurogenic hyperventilation: pharmacologic intervention with morphine sulfate and correlative analysis of respiratory, sleep, and ocular motor dysfunction. Central neurogenic hyperventilation (CNH), for which there is no effective therapy, can eventually result in respiratory fatigue and death. This report describes a patient with CNH due to a brainstem anaplastic astrocytoma who also exhibited disturbances of sleep and ocular motor function. The CNH responded clinically to morphine sulfate and methadone. Analysis of ventilatory response to CO2 before and after morphine demonstrated a depression of ventilatory response (49 to 53% of baseline) and occlusion pressure response (35 to 50% of baseline) to CO2, with a requirement for high doses of naloxone (10 mg IV) to reverse the effect. Polysomnography revealed sustained hyperventilation, elevated O2 saturation, and low end-tidal CO2 throughout all stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Ocular motor evaluation disclosed absence of horizontal and reflexive saccades with compensatory head thrusts. Correlation of the clinical and physiologic data with the MRI abnormalities suggested that the lesion responsible for CNH in this patient might reside in the medial tegmental parapontine reticular formation. Since recurrent episodes of hyperventilation responded in a sustained fashion to IV and oral opiates, this treatment may warrant consideration in other patients with CNH. 
4	Arteriovenous fistula as a complication of temporary pacemaker insertion: treatment with percutaneous embolization. Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication of central venous catheterization. We present a case of right internal mammary artery-to-right innominate vein fistula resulting from emergent insertion of a temporary pacemaker. Percutaneous management is discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
4	Temporal arteritis presenting as a submandibular swelling. Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is a disease of protean manifestation. A case which presented as a submandibular swelling is reported. 
3	Pneumocephalus secondary to a high-pressure water injury to the nose. We report a case of pneumocephalus following a water jet injury to the nose incurred during a water-skiing fall. Pneumocephalus due to this type of injury has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. Since this unusual injury may be associated with serious complications, it must be promptly recognized and treated. 
1	Cervical lymph node metastasis: assessment of radiologic criteria. To estimate the accuracy of different radiologic criteria used to detect cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with head and neck carcinoma, seven different characteristics of 2,719 lymph nodes in 71 neck dissection specimens from 55 patients were assessed. Three lymph node diameters, their location, their number, the presence of a tumor, and the amount of necrosis and fatty metaplasia were recorded. The minimal diameter in the axial plane was found to be the most accurate size criterion for predicting lymph node metastasis. A minimal axial diameter of 10 mm was determined to be the most effective size criterion. The size criterion for lymph nodes in the subdigastric region was 1 mm larger (11 mm). Groups of three or more borderline nodes were proved to increase the sensitivity but did not significantly decrease the specificity. Radiologically detectable necrosis (3 mm or larger) was found only in tumorous nodes and was present in 74% of the positive neck dissection specimens. Shape was not a valuable criterion for the radiologic assessment of the cervical lymph node status. 
3	Magnetic resonance in pediatric and adolescent neuroimaging. With improved availability and a practical understanding of the principles of utilization, MRI will continue to replace CT and US in pediatric neuroimaging, just as it has impacted upon the more invasive modalities. In general, US remains the procedure of choice for screening of fetal and infant CNS abnormalities, and CT continues as the principal screening modality beyond infancy and especially for acute, emergent presentations. MRI has now emerged as a primary option for screening as well as for more definitive assessment of many intracranial and most intraspinal conditions. 
5	Duration of the QT interval and total and cardiovascular mortality in healthy persons (The Framingham Heart Study experience). The baseline electrocardiograms of 5,125 original subjects of the Framingham Heart Study were measured to examine the relation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) to risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death, and death due to coronary artery disease over a 30-year follow-up period. Quintiles of QTc (seconds) less than or equal to 0.36, 0.36 to 0.38, 0.39 to 0.40, 0.41 to 0.43 and greater than or equal to 0.44 were studied in relation to these outcomes. There were no significant differences in the risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death or death due to coronary artery disease according to QTc. A similar lack of significant association between QTc and these 3 outcomes was observed among all persons studied and in the 2 sexes after using a multiple regression analysis to control for several potentially confounding characteristics including age, gender, cigarette smoking, serum total cholesterol, systolic systemic blood pressure and Framingham relative weight. The results of this study fail to demonstrate an association between baseline QTc and overall mortality, and deaths due to sudden cardiac events or coronary artery disease in a large population-based cohort of essentially healthy persons in whom pathologic forms of QTc prolongation are uncommon. 
4	Posttachycardia T-wave changes. A 25-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department with a tachydysrhythmia. After pharmacological intervention, the patient's rhythm converted to normal sinus and symmetrically inverted T-wave changes were noted. Although asymptomatic after conversion, the patient was admitted to the hospital and monitored for two days to rule out cardiac ischemia correlating with the T-wave changes. The patient was ultimately discharged in good health. A review of the emergency medical literature fails to reveal examples of post-tachycardic T-wave changes that may simulate myocardial ischemia but be of no clinical significance. 
5	Efficacy and toxicity of sodium stibogluconate for mucosal leishmaniasis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and toxicity of the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended treatment for mucosal leishmaniasis: antimony, 20 mg/kg body weight per day for 28 days. DESIGN: Open trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Inpatient unit of a regional referral hospital in a developing country. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine consecutive eligible patients with culture-confirmed infection of the mucosa with Leishmania species who were otherwise healthy. Eight patients (28%) had mild to moderate disease (confined to the nasal mucosa). Twenty-one patients (72%) had severe disease (including the oropharynx as well as the nasal mucosa). INTERVENTION: Antimony, 20 mg/kg body weight intravenously every day for 28 days. Patients received antimony in the form of sodium stibogluconate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Initial results of therapy were as follows: 63 of 72 lesions (88%) healed or markedly improved; all lesions were culture-negative for parasites; and 18 of 29 patients (62%) showed complete clinical and parasitologic cure of all lesions. By the 12-month follow-up examinations, however, 37 lesions had recurred, 8 new lesions had appeared, and only 8 patients (30%) showed clinical cure of all lesions. Of the 8 patients with mild to moderate disease, 6 were cured compared with only 2 of the 21 patients with severe disease. Side effects of this treatment regimen included T-wave inversion on electrocardiogram (4 patients), abnormal liver function tests (10 patients), and musculoskeletal pain (24 patients). No side effects occurred during week 1 of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The only recommended treatment for mucosal leishmaniasis is ineffective in patients with severe disease. The acceptable toxicity of the regimen suggests that longer courses of therapy with antimony, or that trials with other antileishmanial agents alone or combined with antimony be evaluated as initial therapy for this disease. 
5	Osteonecrosis of the knee after arthroscopic surgery: diagnosis with MR imaging. Spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee typically is a disease of the elderly characterized by an acute onset of pain. The exact cause of this condition has long been debated, although a causative relationship between meniscal tears and spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee has been postulated. Seven patients with knee pain, meniscal tears, and chondromalacia without initial evidence of osteonecrosis at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging underwent arthroscopic surgery with meniscal recontouring or repair and cartilage shaving. These patients returned within 2-14 months with recurrent pain in the treated knee. MR imaging then demonstrated abnormalities consistent with osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau may be a late sequela of meniscal injury in association with chondromalacia and arthroscopic surgery. This diagnosis should be suspected in patients with recurrent knee pain after arthroscopic repair of meniscal tears. The precise relationship of this pattern of osteonecrosis to that previously described as spontaneous requires further investigation. 
5	Adult height in boys and girls with untreated short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty: accuracy of five different methods of height prediction. To determine how accurately several methods of height prediction estimate adult height, we compared height predictions calculated by the Bayley-Pinneau, Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT), target height, and Tanner-Whitehouse Mark I (TW-MI), and Mark II (TW-MII) methods with final adult height in 37 boys and 32 girls with short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty. They were first seen at a chronologic age (mean +/- SD) of 14.80 +/- 1.70 years (boys) and 12.87 +/- 2.56 years (girls). Adult height at 23.14 +/- 1.95 years and 21.05 +/- 2.02 years was 170.4 +/- 5.4 cm (boys) and 157.8 +/- 4.2 cm (girls), respectively, and thus within the lower range of normal. Height predictions were calculated for the total group and for patients with parents of normal (group 1) as well as short stature (group 2). For boys, the RWT method gave very accurate results, underestimating adult height by -0.6 cm for the total group. The prediction errors for the other methods were -7.3 cm (TW-MI), -4.2 cm (TW-MII), and +3.1 cm (Bayley-Pinneau method) or +1.7 cm (target height). For girls, no method was superior in estimating adult height. The mean prediction error was -0.8 cm, -2.1 cm, and -1.8 cm with the Bayley-Pinneau, TW-MI, and TW-MII methods, respectively. In contrast, adult height was overpredicted by +2.3 cm and +1.2 cm with the RWT and target height methods. We conclude that patients with short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty reach an adult height in the lower range of normal. Height prediction methods differ with respect to their accuracy and their tendency to overestimate or underestimate adult height. 
3	Pontine supranuclear facial palsy. Two patients presented with a unilateral supranuclear facial palsy. Additional dysarthria was attributed to the pontine origin documented by magnetic resonance imaging on the contralateral side. The pontine disorder also was indicated by an isolated delay of the blink reflex R1 component or of the masseter reflex. We attribute the facial palsy to a lesion of a supranuclear fiber bundle supplying the facial nucleus. The location of the lesions favors these fibers taking a separate course from the main pyramidal tract at the mid- to upper pontine level. 
3	Combination of Anandron with orchiectomy in treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Results of a double-blind study. A multicenter, randomized double-blind study was carried out in 203 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, in order to compare the efficacy of complete suppression of androgens achieved with surgical castration and nilutamide (Anandron), 100 mg t.i.d. The combined therapy was well-tolerated by patients, and they noted a better relief of bone pain after six months than those in the control group. There was a greater number of favorable responses in the combined treatment group. In addition, despite a similar median progression-free actuarial rate, the combined treatment (nilutamide plus orchiectomy) offered an improved survival time over orchiectomy alone. 
5	Gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male. A presentation of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. Munchausen's syndrome by Proxy is a well-described entity that may not always be immediately considered in a complicated case. We describe this syndrome being portrayed through the guise of gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male and discuss not only the difficulty involved in solidifying this diagnosis but also the consequences that may occur should this diagnosis not be entertained. Failure to diagnose Munchausen's syndrome by proxy often results from failure to consider the diagnosis. These cases frequently have specific characteristics that allow seasoned clinicians to suspect the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is considered, it is crucial to take steps to protect not only the index patient but also siblings who not infrequently are also recipients of this life threatening form of child abuse. 
5	Reverse coitus: mechanism of urethral injury in male partner. Reverse coitus, a rarely used sexual position, makes the male urethra more vulnerable to injury from the pubic arch and symphysis pubis of the female partner. Severe pain, bleeding and immediate detumescence were observed in 3 patients. The lesion usually occurred at the fossa navicularis, responded well to conservative management and did not hinder micturition. Potency has been well preserved in all 3 patients. 
1	Hypercalcemia in malignancy. The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in malignancy has been enigmatic until recent years. Since the realization in 1980 that bioassays for parathyroid hormone detected a cross-reacting substance in malignancy, progress has been remarkably rapid. A parathyroid hormone-related protein was purified and identified by molecular cloning as a 141-amino acid peptide with limited homology to parathyroid hormone itself. Nonetheless, both peptides activate the parathyroid hormone receptor to produce hypercalcemia. It is now clear that the parathyroid hormone-related protein is the cause of hypercalcemia in most solid tumors, particularly squamous and renal carcinomas. New assays for the hormone as well as the related peptide have greatly simplified the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. At the same time, new agents for the treatment of hypercalcemia are becoming available, most notably the bisphosphonate drugs. 
4	Gallbladder varices: imaging findings in patients with portal hypertension. A retrospective review of the medical and imaging records of 50 patients with portal hypertension examined in the authors' department during a 2-year period identified six patients with gallbladder wall varices. Imaging studies performed in these patients included computed tomography (CT) (four patients), duplex and color Doppler flow (five patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) (four patients). Five of six patients with gallbladder varices had portal vein thrombosis. Anechoic areas within the gallbladder wall detected with ultrasonography could be distinguished from intramural edema by using duplex or color Doppler flow imaging in all five patients in whom it was used. Contrast material enhancement of these varices was detected with CT in three patients, two of whom also had adjacent mesenteric collaterals. Gradient-echo MR imaging (fast imaging in steady precession/fast low-angle shot) showed flow-related enhancement within the gallbladder wall in two patients. The presence of gallbladder wall varices may imply the presence of portal vein thrombosis. Since these varices can be a source of major blood loss, surgeons must be made aware of them when operating on patients with portal hypertension. 
5	Serial ultrasonographic evaluation of neonatal vein of Galen malformations to assess the efficacy of interventional neuroradiological procedures. Two-dimensional echocardiography complemented with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a vein of Galen malformation who had severe high-output congestive heart failure and cranial bruits at birth. Intracranial blood flow through the vein of Galen malformations, cardiac status, and direction of aortic blood flow were assessed before and after staged interventional neuroradiological treatment with transarterial and transvenous embolization procedures. Color-flow imaging in each infant displayed the major vascular anatomy including feeding vessels and the patterns of filling of the vein of Galen malformations. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound performed on the descending aorta above the diaphragm showed the degree of diastolic flow reversal indicative of runoff into the vein of Galen malformations. A reduction in blood flow through the vein of Galen malformation was seen on color-flow imaging in four patients treated successfully by embolic procedures. The ratio of diastolic retrograde flow velocity in the descending aorta to systolic antegrade velocity decreased from 0.51 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 0.15 +/- 0.20 (P less than 0.05). Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with vein of Galen malformations. 
5	Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system: I. Intraventricular and extracerebral lesions. The results of observations of the first 100 neonates at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who received magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system by means of a high-field image (1.5 T) are reported. All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project. 
5	The modified Schollner costoplasty. The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis. We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis. We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications. Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case. All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit. 
4	Cholesterol screening in a black inner-city pediatric population. A screening for total blood cholesterol levels was conducted by the University of Louisville Department of Family Practice in association with the National Youth Sports Program in Louisville, Kentucky. On May 30, 1987, 224 inner-city children between 10 and 16 years of age were tested; 109 (49%) were girls and 115 (51%) were boys. All participants were black. Of the entire population, the girls had a slightly lower mean level of cholesterol than the boys (160 mg/dL vs 165 mg/dL, respectively). Because of the large number of participants aged 10 to 14 years (211), this subset of children was studied more closely. In this age group, 47 (22%) of the children were at moderate risk for future cardiovascular disease and 48 (23%) were at high risk. The serum cholesterol levels were relatively constant in all children until age 12, after which a slight reduction occurred. This decrease is more evident in boys. Our study also showed a correlation between increased blood cholesterol and above normal weight/height indices (ie, Quetelet scores), with nearly 70% of all children having elevated cholesterol levels also exhibiting above normal Quetelet scores. We observed no correlation between high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in this study population. Dietary intervention is recommended as the initial treatment for elevated cholesterol levels in children. 
1	Inositol phosphate formation in the human squamous cell carcinoma line SCC-12 F: studies with bradykinin, the calcium ionophore A23187, and sodium fluoride. The phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides is an important signal transduction pathway coupled to the cell-surface receptors for several hormones and growth factors. In addition, PLC activity can be modulated by changes in intracellular calcium and activation of GTP binding proteins. In this report, differential activation of PLC in the human keratinocyte cell line SCC-12F was studied as judged by specific patterns of inositol phosphate formation. Several hormones and growth factors previously shown to stimulate PLC in a variety of cell types were screened for activity in SCC-12F cells. Only bradykinin was active, stimulating the PLC-dependent generation of inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 was rapidly metabolized to inositol(1,4)biphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) and inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and subsequently degraded to inositol monophosphates. The response elicited by bradykinin was concentration dependent (EC50 value of 50 nM), suggesting involvement of a specific bradykinin receptor. Treatment of these cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 appeared to result in the direct formation of Ins(1,4)P2 without Ins(1,4,5)P3 as precursor. Treatment of the cells with AIF4-, a putative activator of GTP binding proteins, resulted in the generation of inositol monophosphates as the major metabolites in the absence of detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the PLC complex present in SCC-12F cells can be differentially activated to yield either Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4)P2, or InsP. The observed effects may be due to a direct PLC-dependent hydrolysis of the appropriate membrane phosphoinositide. 
4	Respiratory muscle strength in congestive heart failure. In experimental animals, conditions which drastically decrease cardiac output may reduce the strength and endurance of respiratory muscles leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. Because patients with chronic CHF have reduced cardiac output and vital capacity (FVC), we measured PImax and PEmax and maximal handgrip force in 16 patients with CHF and 18 AMNs. The patients with CHF had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 26 +/- 7 percent. Maximal respiratory pressures were significantly reduced; group mean values (+/- SD) for PImax at FRC were 41.4 +/- 5.6 cm H2O (CHF) and 102.1 +/- 27.4 cm H2O (AMN) (p less than 0.001), with PImax values in five patients with CHF as low as 20 to 30 cm H2O. In most patients, PEmax was comparably reduced. Handgrip force was less dramatically reduced, suggesting selective respiratory muscle weakness. Possible explanations include reduction in respiratory muscle blood flow or generalized muscular atrophy and weakness related to cardiac cachexia. 
5	Growth hormone inhibits tumor metastasis. The effect of growth hormone on tumor growth and metabolism in the tumor-bearing host is unknown. This study was done to determine the effect of recombinant growth hormone on primary tumor growth, tumor metastasis, and carcass weight in tumor-bearing animals. Twenty-seven female Lobund/Wistar rats with subcutaneous prostate tumor implants (PA-III) were randomized to receive a standard protein diet (22.0% protein; 4.27 kcal/g) or an isocaloric, protein-depleted diet (0.03% protein; 4.27 kcal/g) ad libitum orally. One half of the animals in each group were randomized to receive daily injections of either recombinant growth hormone (1000 mU/kg/day intramuscularly) or placebo (saline) for 14 days. A significant increase in body weight was observed in growth hormone-treated animals without acceleration of primary tumor growth. Spontaneous pulmonary metastasis was inhibited significantly in animals in both dietary groups treated with growth hormone. Thus, growth hormone selectively supports host growth and inhibits pulmonary metastasis in this tumor-bearing animal model. The potential metabolic effects and clinical consequences of treating cancer patients with growth hormone is discussed. 
5	Does auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation reverse hypersplenism and portal hypertension? In this study, performed to assess the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism, eight patients with chronic liver disease who underwent the procedure and had functioning grafts for at least 6 months were analyzed. The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism. 
3	Multicenter long-term safety and efficacy study of vigabatrin for refractory complex partial seizures: an update. We followed 66 patients with refractory complex partial seizures and a favorable initial response to vigabatrin for 5 to 72 (median, 43) months. Thirty-seven patients discontinued vigabatrin for the following reasons: benefit-to-risk evaluation, 8; seizure breakthrough, 6; adverse events, 6; seizure breakthrough and adverse events, 5; moved or lost, 4; no longer eligible for study, 2; non-drug-related death, 2; narcotic abuse, 1; and patient request, three. There were no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory studies including SMA 12, complete blood count, ECG, EEG, and visual evoked response testing, and no toxicity other than reversible, dose-dependent side effects. Based on this and other long-term data, clinical trials of vigabatrin have resumed in the United States and Canada. 
4	Elevated insulin, norepinephrine, and neuropeptide Y in hypertension. To investigate the relationship between insulin and sympathetic activity, plasma norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y, serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in ten age-, weight-, and sex-matched normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects at fasting and 2 h following ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose dose. Hypertensives had higher fasting serum insulin (27 +/- 6 v 12 +/- 2 microU/mL; P = .02) and plasma norepinephrine (356 +/- 38 v 235 +/- 35 pg/mL; P = .03) concentrations than normotensives. Glucose load increased serum insulin (P less than .001) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (P = .001) in both groups and hypertensives had still higher postglucose insulin (P = .003) and norepinephrine levels (P = .003) than normotensives. Fasting neuropeptide Y was higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (P = .03) and correlated with age in both groups (r = 0.7; r = 0.77). Postglucose serum insulin correlated positively with plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.75; P = .013) in normotensives, but these parameters correlated negatively in hypertensives (r = -0.7; P = .036). We hypothesize that elevated plasma norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y levels reflect an increased level of sympathetic nervous activity in hypertensives, which in turn may be responsible for the abnormal relationship between plasma NE and insulin levels. 
4	Patency rate of implantable devices during long-term intraarterial chemotherapy. Intraarterial implantable drug delivery systems have been considered as an alternative method for treating patients with unresectable liver malignancies. However, catheter problems with external implanted devices have resulted in limited application of chemotherapy. The introduction of subcutaneous devices offers an opportunity for long-term locoregional chemotherapy. Twelve external intraarterial catheters were implanted into 12 patients and 52 subcutaneously placed devices into 51 patients, all with various hepatic malignancies. Retrospective analyses comparing those two intraarterial systems were conducted taking into account the function and complication rate (hepatic artery thrombosis, infection, leaking, hemorrhage, and dislocation). The follow-up time for the external system was two to eight months (median five weeks), the thrombosis rate 33.3%, and the infection rate 25%. One instance of severe bleeding from the hepatic artery occurred during chemotherapy. One catheter dislocated. For the subcutaneously implanted intraarterial devices the follow-up time was five to forty-one months (median sixteen months), the thrombotic complication rate 17.3%, and the infection rate 7.6% (all patients with simultaneous bowel surgery). Catheter dislocation one year later required reimplantation; in 1 patient therapy had to be discontinued because of a catheter leak. The overall function rate was 71.3% with a median follow-up time of eight months. Anticoagulation therapy for subcutaneously implanted devices starting from the beginning of intraarterial chemotherapy is recommended to achieve long-term patency. No implantation should be preformed simultaneously with bowel surgery. The subcutaneously placed intraarterial devices had a higher function rate and were available for a longer period as compared with external implanted catheters. 
4	Usefulness of blood lactate as a predictor of shock development in acute myocardial infarction [published erratum appears in Am J Cardiol 1991 Apr 15;67(9):912] Data were obtained and analyzed in 229 patients admitted to the coronary care unit from November 1988 through July 1989. The patients were classified into 2 groups: patients without or with only mild left ventricular failure (Killip class I or II) during their hospital stay (group I), and patients who were in Killip class I or II on admission but developed cardiogenic shock during hospitalization (group II). Discriminant function analysis was performed using the following variables: patients' age, history of previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, blood lactate, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, and chest x-ray cardiothoracic ratio. Variables that were found to significantly discriminate the 2 groups of patients were age, previous infarction, x-ray cardiothoracic ratio, blood urea and lactate concentrations. The risk index was computed, and blood lactate was the variable with the greatest predictive power for shock development. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the risk index, taking various cutoff points, were calculated. With a cutoff value of 1, sensitivity was 65%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 36% and negative predictive value 97%. With a cutoff value of 2, sensitivity was 53%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 82% and negative predictive value 96%. 
4	Doxazosin in the treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension: an echocardiographic study. Sixteen patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension received 1 to 8 mg/day of doxazosin (mean daily dose, 2.7 mg). Blood pressure reduction (supine and standing) was highly significant (p less than 0.001), and no significant changes in heart rate were observed. A significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in left ventricular mass was seen without a change in left ventricular systolic function. All side effects were mild, and only one patient withdrew from the study. 
1	Effects of hypothyroidism on bronchial reactivity in non-asthmatic subjects. The effect of hypothyroidism on non-specific bronchial reactivity was studied in 11 patients without pulmonary disease (mean age 40 (SD 13) years) who had had a total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer 41 (36) months before the study. All patients when mildly hyperthyroid while having long term thyroxine replacement treatment and once when hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine for the purpose of screening for metastases. Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring specific airways conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled carbachol (45-1260 micrograms). The dose producing a 35% decrease in sGaw (PD35) was determined from the cumulative log dose-response curve by linear regression analysis. Mean baseline sGaw values were similar when the patients were hypothyroid and when they were hyperthyroid (1.35 (0.36) and 1.41 (0.56) s-1 kPa-1). The interstudy coefficients of variation of baseline sGaw were higher in the thyroid patients than in a euthyroid control group (14% versus 8%). Geometric mean PD35 was lower when the patients were hypothyroid (97 micrograms) than when they were mildly hyperthyroid (192 micrograms). It is concluded that acute hypothyroidism increases non-specific bronchial reactivity in nonasthmatic subjects. 
1	Expression of enzymatically active sucrase-isomaltase is a ubiquitous property of colon adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinoma of the colon is one of the most prevalent and lethal of all human malignancies. The early diagnosis and management of this disease could be improved if biological markers, whose expression was restricted to malignant colon cells, were identified. Sucrase-isomaltase is a glycoprotein hydrolase expressed throughout the small intestine and fetal colon but not in the normal adult colon. This study shows that the expression of enzymatically active sucrase-isomaltase is a ubiquitous property of primary and metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Significant sucrase enzyme activity (i.e., greater than 5 mU/mg protein) was observed in 16 colon carcinomas but not in adjacent normal colon mucosa. Sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA was identified in all tumors using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, this study shows that the amount of sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA in tumors examined (3.4 x 10(-8) to 3.19 x 10(-7) micrograms/micrograms total RNA) was greater than in adjacent mucosa (0 to 3.4 x 10(-8) micrograms/micrograms total RNA). This induction of sucrase-isomaltase messenger RNA and enzyme activity was corroborated by immunostaining. Of 30 colon adenocarcinomas examined, 80% were positive for sucrase-isomaltase. In addition, all colon carcinoma metastases examined were positive for sucrase-isomaltase. The staining pattern was distinct and demarcated tumor cells from the surrounding histologically normal tissue. No sucrase-isomaltase staining was seen in normal mucosa from the same patients. With the exception of lung, no sucrase-isomaltase immunostaining was observed in a variety of examined noncolonic adenocarcinomas. Thus, the specificity and ubiquity of sucrase-isomaltase expression in adenocarcinomas of the colon can be exploited to improve the clinical management of this disease. In addition, studies on the structure of the sucrase-isomaltase gene and its regulatory elements should contribute toward understanding the alteration of gene expression by oncogenic transformation of the colonic mucosa. 
4	Early detection and treatment of hyperlipidemia: physician practices in Canada. We surveyed primary care physicians in Canada to determine their current practices regarding the detection and treatment of hyperlipidemia in asymptomatic adults 20 years of age or more and to determine the role of selected patient characteristics (age, sex and the presence of coronary heart disease [CHD] risk factors) in their management decisions. The self-administered questionnaire was completed by 428 of 804 family physicians and general practitioners. The proportion of physicians who reported having tested at least 50% of their adult patients varied from 29% to 85% and was related to the number of CHD risk factors present and the patient's age. The proportion of respondents who reported starting dietary or drug therapy among patients with a cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or less increased as the number of CHD risk factors increased and was not related to patient age or sex. According to the factors examined our results suggest that primary care physicians in Canada select patients for screening and treatment mainly on the basis of CHD risk factors present and that their approach is more conservative than that recommended by the Canadian and US consensus conferences. 
1	Free alpha subunit of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones. Measurement in serum and tissue of patients with pituitary tumors. A solid-phase radioimmunoassay was developed that measures the free alpha subunits of pituitary glycoprotein hormones (alpha PGpHs) and has negligible cross-reactivity with the intact hormones (less than 0.014% for thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], less than 0.1% for human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], 0.8% for luteinizing hormone [LH], and 2.0% for follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). The assay is standardized with the alpha subunit of hCG but also reacts well with the alpha subunits of the other glycoprotein hormones (84% for alpha TSH, 77% for alpha FSH, and 64% for alpha LH). Concentrations as low as 0.3 micrograms/L can be reliably measured, and the 97.5% reference range in 27 healthy adults, including postmenopausal females, is less than or equal to 1.2 micrograms/L. Elevated preoperative alpha PGpH concentrations were found in 45 (9.4%) of 479 sera from patients with pituitary adenoma and 3 (4.5%) of 66 patients with nonadenomatous sellar lesions. Postoperative alpha PGpH levels were lower in 30 of 39 adenoma patients and 2 of 3 nonadenoma patients. In five (1%) of the patients with pituitary adenomas, alpha PGpH was the only elevated serum hormone marker. Serum values of alpha PGpH correlate weakly with alpha subunit immunocytochemical staining--95% of those with negative staining have normal alpha PGpH values, but only 18% of those with positive staining have elevated alpha PGpH values. 
1	Elevated serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors in small cell lung carcinoma. The presence of the soluble form of the interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) was evaluated in the serum of 21 patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 37 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (non-SCLC) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sIL-2R level was measured serially in patients with SCLC both during and after therapy. The mean serum level of sIL-2R in patients with SCLC was 3.8 times higher than that of 47 healthy controls and was 1.9 times higher than in 37 patients with non-SCLC. Six patients with SCLC had very high levels of sIL-2R, ranging from five to 52 times the mean level observed in normal controls. Tumor cells in the pleural fluid of the patient with highest levels were positive with monoclonal antibodies to IL-2R (CD25), NKH-1, OKDR, and OKT9. A longitudinal study in this patient showed a good correlation between tumor activity and sIL-2R levels. Also, the sIL-2R levels decreased in patients responding to therapy. These results suggest that some SCLCs secrete sIL-2R and that the serial measurements of the serum sIL-2R levels can be used as a noninvasive tumor marker in this disease. 
1	Hepatic venoocclusive disease in autologous bone marrow transplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion. Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002). Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive. No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD. However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents. Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD. The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days). One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed. In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents. 
5	A simple method to improve the accuracy of non-invasive ultrasound in selecting TIA patients for cerebral angiography. A prospective study is reported of the ability of B mode ultrasound imaging and continuous wave Doppler flow studies to detect different degrees of stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in 186 arteries in 99 patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic stroke. A simple mathematical equation has been developed which combines the image and flow data to provide a single predictor of the degree of angiographic stenosis which has advantages over either ultrasonic modality used alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model in the detection of stenosis greater than or equal to 25% was 73% and 98%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 50% was 90% and 93%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, 65% and 99% and occlusion 100% and 94% respectively. The principal clinical value of ultrasound screening is to spare patients with "non-significant" stenosis the risk of unnecessary angiography. Thus a simple measure of the Duplex screening tests' performance is the proportion of all strokes occurring as a complication of angiography that are avoided by changing the investigation policy from "angiograms for all carotid TIA and minor ischaemic stroke patients" to "angiograms for all patients with abnormal ultrasound results". If Duplex scanning were used to select patients most likely to have a significant abnormality on angiography, depending on the degree of stenosis to be detected, 52-85% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. If the predictive equation were used 62-88% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. 
5	Limits of brain tolerance to daily increments in serum sodium in chronically hyponatraemic rats treated with hypertonic saline or urea: advantages of urea. 1. At present there is no consensus about the optimal management of hyponatraemia to prevent demyelinating brain lesions. We have evaluated in a large series of rats (n = 136) the protective role of urea for the brain in the treatment of severe chronic hyponatraemia. Urea (group I, n = 51) was compared with hypertonic saline in boluses (group II, n = 46) and with hypertonic saline in divided doses (group III, n = 39). Treatment was administered intraperitoneally over 48 h. The severity of brain lesions was assessed by histological scoring. 2. For 95% of the injured animals treated with hypertonic saline, brain lesions appeared for an absolute increment in serum Na+ concentration (delta SNa+) of 20 mmol day-1 l-1. Above this limit neurological injuries gradually worsened, and beyond a transition zone (delta SNa+ greater than or equal to 20 less than or equal to 23 mmol day-1 l-1) 89% (group III) to 100% (group II) of the animals were injured. This limit can be reached rapidly, as attested by the comparable severity of brain lesions observed in group II (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after a bolus injection, 19 mmol/l) and in group III (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after an injection, 2 mmol/l), both groups achieving similar daily delta SNa+. 3. A correction above the threshold of 20 mmol day-1 l-1 is as toxic during the first 24 h as during the second day of the treatment. 
5	Heart and lung transplantation for terminal cystic fibrosis. A 4 1/2-year experience. From among 112 patients with cystic fibrosis who were assessed for heart-lung transplantation, 83 were accepted. Twenty-six died while awaiting heart-lung transplantation and 32 had the operation. The management and the outcome of these 32 patients is reported. Survival, infection, and rejection rates among these patients were compared with those of 61 patients without cystic fibrosis who underwent heart-lung transplantation between 1984 and 1990. The cumulative survival rate was 72.29% +/- 94.91% at 1 year and 55.59% +/- 7.50% at 3 years. The mortality rate was slightly higher in the group with cystic fibrosis during the first year after the operation but it was lower at 3 years. The difference, however, could have been due to chance alone (p = 0.308). The same was true for the prevalence of rejection (up to 6 months: chi 2 = 1.8141, p = 0.17), and infection (up to 6 months: chi 2 = 2.20, p = 0.14), between the two groups. It is concluded that cystic fibrosis does not constitute an additional risk in terms of survival and morbidity after heart-lung transplantation. 
4	Exposing patients with chronic, stable, exertional angina to placebo periods in drug trials. Because the safety of withholding standard therapy and enrolling patients with stable angina in placebo-controlled trials is not known, we identified all events leading to dropout from trials of 12 antianginal drugs submitted in support of new drug applications to the US Food and Drug Administration. Persons who dropped out of the trials were classified as cause due to adverse cardiovascular events or other causes without knowledge of drug assignment. There were 3161 subjects who entered any randomized, double-blind phase of placebo-controlled protocols; 197 (6.2%) withdrew because of cardiovascular events. There was no difference in risk of adverse events between drug and placebo groups. A prospectively defined subgroup analysis showed that groups who received calcium antagonists were at an increased risk of dropout compared with placebo groups (P = .04), primarily because of a disproportionate number of adverse events in studies of one drug. In conclusion, there were few adverse experiences associated with short-term placebo use. Withholding active treatment does not increase the risk of serious cardiac events. 
5	Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. 
2	Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease. The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient. 
5	Hole preparation techniques for transpedicle screws. Effect on pull-out strength from human cadaveric vertebrae. In each of eight thoracolumbar human cadaveric vertebrae, a hole was made through one pedicle into the vertebral body with a drill bit and through the contralateral pedicle with a probe. Identical metal screws were implanted into the holes to equal depths, and maximum pull-out force was determined for each screw. Using a paired Student t test, no significant difference (P = 0.87) was found in pull-out strength between the screws implanted into drilled holes and those implanted into probed holes. In fact, the average pull-out strengths for the two groups differed by less than 2%. The pedicular cortex was broken through during hole preparation in 5 of the 16 pedicles: 3 as a result of drilling and 2 secondary to probing. The average pull-out strength of the screws in these five pedicles was 11.0% less than the average pull-out strength of the screws implanted into the contralateral intact pedicles. Although this does not represent a statistically significant difference (P = 0.15), it suggests that damaging the pedicular cortex may weaken pedicle screw fixation. 
5	Molecular defect in siblings with prolidase deficiency and absence or presence of clinical symptoms. A 0.8-kb deletion with breakpoints at the short, direct repeat in the PEPD gene and synthesis of abnormal messenger RNA and inactive polypeptide. Prolidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with highly variable symptoms, including mental retardation, skin lesions, and abnormalities of collagenous tissues. In Japanese female siblings with polypeptide negative prolidase deficiency, and with different degrees of severity of skin lesions, we noted an abnormal mRNA with skipping of 192 bp sequence corresponding to exon 14 in lymphoblastoid cells taken from these patients. Transfection and expression analyses using the mutant prolidase cDNA revealed that a mutant protein translated from the abnormal mRNA had an Mr of 49,000 and was enzymatically inactive. A 774-bp deletion, including exon 14 was noted in the prolidase gene. The deletion had termini within short, direct repeats ranging in size of 7 bp (CCACCCT). The "slipped mispairing" mechanism may predominate in the generation of the deletion at this locus. This mutation caused a 192-bp in-frame deletion of prolidase mRNA and was inherited from the consanguineous parents. The same mutation caused a different degree of clinical phenotype of prolidase deficiency in this family, therefore factor(s) not related to the PEPD gene product also contribute to development of the clinical symptoms. Identification of mutations in the PEPD gene from subjects with prolidase deficiency provides further insight into the physiological role and structure-function relationship of this biologically important enzyme. 
5	Trisomy 13: a new recurring chromosome abnormality in acute leukemia. A new recurring chromosome abnormality was identified in 8 of 621 consecutive successfully karyotyped adults with de novo acute leukemia. These eight patients had trisomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. On central morphologic review, five cases were classified as subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia, one as acute mixed lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, one as acute lymphoid leukemia, and one as acute undifferentiated leukemia. Blasts of all eight cases expressed one or more myeloid differentiation antigens. Three also expressed T-lineage-associated antigens; however, none of these had rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta, gamma, or delta genes. Four of six cases tested were TdT positive. All eight patients with trisomy 13 were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy; only three entered a short-lived complete remission. Survival of patients with trisomy 13 ranged from 0.5 to 14.7 months, and was significantly shorter than that of the remaining patients (median 9.5 v 16.2 months, P = .007). We conclude that trisomy 13 is a rare, recurring clonal chromosome abnormality in acute leukemia associated with a poor prognosis. Malignant transformation of an immature hematopoietic precursor cell is suggested by the expression of antigens characteristic of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, the high incidence of TdT positivity, and the morphologic heterogeneity in these leukemias. 
4	A cellist with arm pain: thermal asymmetry in scalenus anticus syndrome. We report on a cellist with pain and coldness of the upper extremity. Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome. 
4	Neuroendocrine activity in congestive heart failure. The increased neuroendocrine activity in patients with congestive heart failure appears to be a generalized attempt to maintain blood pressure at the expense of reduced cardiac performance and salt and water retention. It is likely that baroreceptor dysfunction contributes to increased sympathetic nervous system activity in patients with congestive heart failure. The usual tonic inhibitory messages emanating from baro- and mechanoreceptors in the great vessels and heart fail to adjust sympathetic traffic from the brain to the periphery, leading to uninhibited sympathetic tone. Arginine vasopressin and plasma renin activity may be increased secondarily; however, plasma renin activity activation could also be induced by a low-salt diet and diuretic use. Preliminary baseline data indicate that patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) but no or very mild symptoms of heart failure have increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor and arginine vasopressin, while plasma renin activity is normal, suggesting that neuroendocrine activity contributes to the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure. Neurohormones such as angiotensin II may alter gene expression, leading to changes in the shape and size of the cell. Remodeling of the heart and blood vessels is associated with both heart failure and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to retard or reverse the remodeling process under certain experimental conditions. Studies are currently under way to test this possibility in patients. 
4	Tricuspid valve incompetence caused by nonpenetrating thoracic trauma. Tricuspid valve incompetence from ruptured papillary muscle or chordae as a result of nonpenetrating trauma is uncommon. Blunt trauma causing partial detachment of a leaflet from the annulus is very rare. We report the case of a young adult involved in a car accident who had these findings. Operative repair with resuture of the leaflet to the annulus and annuloplasty using a Carpentier ring resulted in complete recovery. 
1	Sequential connection of flaps: a logical approach to customized mandibular reconstruction. Microsurgery has improved the success rate for reconstruction of composite defects in the head and neck. Restoration of mandibular continuity alone is not adequate for reconstruction. Replacement of the oral lining with thin tissue is necessary to improve tongue mobility and to set the stage for later dental restoration. There is currently no ideal osteocutaneous free flap that provides unlimited length of bone, can undergo multiple osteotomies to produce the proper curve to the reconstructed mandible, and provides thin skin for oral lining. Combining free flaps can take advantage of the strengths of the individual donor sites and eliminate some of the problems with current osteocutaneous flaps. In six patients, a fibular osseous free flap was combined with either a radial forearm flap or a lateral arm flap to provide bone and oral lining in reconstruction of mandibular composite defects. In these selected patients, the fibula provided the blood supply for the second free flap, which was placed sequentially. The distal peroneal vessels were used to anastomose to the radial forearm vessels or the lateral arm pedicle. This approach allows the surgeon to customize the defect by improving both the functional and aesthetic aspects of reconstruction and is of use in cases where vascular access is limited, such as following head and neck surgery and radiation. 
2	Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in specific forms of gastritis. Further evidence supporting a pathogenic role for H. pylori in chronic nonspecific gastritis. Helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa is strongly associated with chronic nonspecific gastritis; moreover, there is evidence to suggest that H. pylori may cause this form of gastritis. However, there is little or no information on the prevalence of H. pylori in specific forms of gastritis. Our hypothesis was that if H. pylori was pathogenic in chronic nonspecific gastritis, organisms would be found frequently in this type of gastritis but infrequently in specific forms of gastritis. Prevalence rates of H. pylori were determined independently in patients with eosinophilic and Crohn's gastritis, Menetrier's disease, and chronic nonspecific gastritis. The prevalence of H. pylori in patients with chronic nonspecific gastritis was 71%, whereas the organism was not identified in patients with any form of specific gastritis. This finding further supports the accumulating evidence that H. pylori is a primary pathogenic factor in chronic nonspecific gastritis. 
1	Late effects of treatment for Wilms' tumor. A report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group. The National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) was initiated in 1969. One of its objectives was to modulate treatments according to risk factors to minimize the number and severity of treatment-related short-term and long-term iatrogenic complications. The NWTS has therefore incorporated a Long Term Follow-up Study (LTFS) within its framework to monitor late effects. The LTFS is confined to relapse-free survivors alive 5 years or longer after initial surgery, and data are collected using specifically designed forms. A total of 787 patients registered on NWTS-1 or NWTS-2 (1969 to 1979) were eligible, of whom 680 (86%) were available for analysis regarding musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychologic status, and the presence of benign and malignant tumors. Patients with early-stage disease who were treated with radiation had scoliosis reported, along with other musculoskeletal abnormalities (32 versus 2), nearly seven times as often as did the members of the cohort population who did not undergo radiation (35 of 57 versus 5 of 53, respectively). The difference in cardiovascular problems recorded in survivors who did and did not receive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (2.4 versus 1.1 per 100-person years at risk) had borderline statistical significance (P = 0.06). No excess in neuropsychologic events was reported for those given the neurotoxin vincristine. When considering patients with disease of all stages, all 5 second malignant tumors occurred in the 623 patients who underwent radiation (RT patients); benign tumors were also more frequent in RT patients than in those patients who did not undergo radiation (41 of 486 or 8% versus 4 of 194 or 2%). Continuing study of this unique body of patients is needed, especially for those given Adriamycin, because of the known long interval needed for latent cardiomyopathy to become clinically manifest in some patients. 
1	Soluble interleukin-2 receptors in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in 72 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using an enzyme immunoassay. Their objectives were to determine the value of serum sIL-2R in estimating the tumor burden, and its predictive value in response to therapy and prognosis. The data showed that serum sIL-2R levels in patients were significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The serum levels correlated with clinical staging and hence the tumor burden of NPC. Serial measurement of serum sIL-2R provided an accurate prognostic index of the clinical response to radiotherapy in at least 89% of patients with raised serum sIL-2R at initial diagnosis (defined as mean + 2 SD of healthy controls) and a reliable predictive index in all patients who subsequently developed distant metastasis despite initial radiotherapy. Simultaneous measurement of Epstein-Barr virus-related serology (IgA-VCA and IgG-EA) failed to demonstrate predictive value comparable with that of serum sIL-2R. The authors conclude that monitoring serum sIL-2R levels has clinical and prognostic significance in patients with NPC and that prospective studies are indicated. 
5	The functional anatomy of motor recovery after stroke in humans: a study with positron emission tomography. We have studied regional cerebral blood flow changes in 6 patients after their recovery from a first hemiplegic stroke. All had a single well-defined hemispheric lesion and at least a brachial monoparesis that subsequently recovered. Each patient had 6 measurements of cerebral blood flow by positron tomography with 2 scans at rest, 2 during movement of fingers of the recovered hand, and 2 during movement of fingers of the normal hand. When the normal fingers were moved, regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. When the fingers of the recovered hand were moved, significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were observed in both contralateral and ipsilateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in both cerebellar hemispheres. Other regions, namely, insula, inferior parietal, and premotor cortex, were also bilaterally activated with movement of the recovered hand. We have also demonstrated, by using a new technique of image analysis, different functional connections between the thalamic nuclei and specific cortical and cerebellar regions during these movements. Our results suggest that ipsilateral motor pathways may play a role in the recovery of motor function after ischemic stroke. 
5	Ruptured mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with recurrence in the liver and colon 17 years later. A case report. A mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurred in a 51-year-old woman and recurred as a large intrahepatic tumor mass as well as a small mass in the transverse colon 17 years after rupture, intraperitoneal spillage of tumor contents and subtotal surgical removal of the ovarian lesion and peritoneal implants. The patient was treated with a partial hepatectomy and a segmental transverse colectomy. The recurrent lesions, which contained histologically fully mature teratomatous elements only, were excised; the result was a complete cure. To our knowledge this is the first documented report on such a complication of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. 
3	Evaluation of vigabatrin as an add-on drug in the management of severe epilepsy. The effects of the addition of Vigabatrin, a new anti-epileptic drug, to the therapy of 128 patients with severe medically refractory epilepsy is reported. Forty two (33%) of patients experienced side effects, which were predominantly neurotropic. In 28 (22%), the drug was withdrawn because of these side effects. The commonest side effects were drowsiness and behavioural change. The remaining 100 patients were followed for a mean of 30 weeks (range 12-75). Forty one of these patients showed a marked improvement in seizure frequency (a 50% or more reduction when compared with the pre-trial period), and nine (7%) were rendered seizure free. Apparent tolerance to the effects of the drug were noted in five patients. An exacerbation of seizures may occur if the drug is withdrawn too quickly. Vigabatrin appears to be a promising new anti-epileptic drug. 
4	The post-occlusive hyperemic response in patients with systemic sclerosis. We investigated post-ischemic hyperreactive cutaneous blood flow in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc). Reactive hyperemia was measured over a locally warmed area of skin, using a laser Doppler flowmeter, following 5 minutes of suprasystolic occlusion of blood flow. We found that patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon had normal post-ischemic blood flow compared with normal controls. In contrast, patients with SSc had reduced levels of baseline and peak blood flow compared with either the primary Raynaud's phenomenon patients or the normal subjects. Infusion of carbaprostacyclin, a potent prostacyclin analog vasodilator, did not increase blood flow in the SSc patients, nor did it restore the reactive hyperemic response. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with the nonvasoconstricted condition of SSc have fixed structural defects that limit cutaneous microvascular blood flow. 
4	Electrophysiologic characteristics of manifest and latent retrograde conduction in dogs. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry requires intact retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction. The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of various pacing and pharmacologic techniques to uncover VA conduction during apparent unidirectional VA block, and to evaluate the role of several biologic and electrophysiologic factors in concealment of retrograde conduction. Forty healthy dogs underwent catheter-electrophysiologic studies of AV and VA conduction. Group I (20 animals) had intact VA conduction. Group II (six animals) had VA dissociation with ventricular pacing initiated during sinus rhythm, but the presence of VA conduction was confirmed by isoproterenol infusion or by premature ventricular stimulation. In group III (14 animals), the above techniques failed to uncover VA conduction. Eight of 14 group III animals underwent thoracotomy and crushing or freezing of the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ventricular pacing initiated during sinus standstill was associated with 1:1 VA conduction in each experiment. VA conduction time and retrograde Wenckebach cycle length, both in the baseline state and during isoproterenol infusion, were significantly longer in the eight animals in group III than in those in group I. Age, gender, weight, breed, sinus cycle length, and anterograde AV conduction properties were not significantly different between groups I, II, and III. The data suggest that (1) in normal dogs, complete unidirectional VA block probably does not exist; (2) in the presence of anterograde input to the AV node, even sophisticated pacing and pharmacologic maneuvers may fail to uncover the presence of VA conduction; (3) although anterograde input is essential for concealment of VA conduction, the phenomenon is more closely associated with depressed retrograde than with anterograde AV nodal characteristics. 
5	Clinical-computed tomographic correlations of lacunar infarction in the Stroke Data Bank. Lacunar stroke was diagnosed in 337 (26%) of the 1,273 patients with cerebral infarction among the 1,805 total in the Stroke Data Bank. We analyzed the 316 patients with classic lacunar syndromes. Among these, 181 (57%) had pure motor hemiparesis, 63 (20%) sensorimotor syndrome, 33 (10%) ataxic hemiparesis, 21 (7%) pure sensory syndrome, and 18 (6%) dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. No striking differences were found among the risk factors for the lacunar subtypes, but differences were found between lacunar stroke as a group and other types of infarcts. Compared to 113 patients with large-vessel atherosclerotic infarction, those with lacunar stroke had fewer previous transient ischemic attacks and strokes. Compared to 246 with cardioembolic infarction, patients with lacunar stroke more frequently had hypertension and diabetes and less frequently had cardiac disease. We found a lesion in 35% of the lacunar stroke patients' computed tomograms, with most lesions located in the internal capsule and corona radiata. The mean infarct volume was greater in patients with pure motor hemiparesis or sensorimotor syndrome than in those with the other lacunar stroke subtypes. In patients with pure motor hemiparesis and infarcts in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, there was a correlation between lesion volume and hemiparesis severity except for the few whose infarct involved the lowest portion of the internal capsule; in these patients severe deficits occurred regardless of lesion volume. Taken together, the computed tomographic correlations with the syndromes of hemiparesis showed only slight support for the classical view of a homunculus in the internal capsule. 
4	Exclusion of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter as a candidate gene in human essential hypertension. The primary abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension are unknown. The known genetic contribution to this disorder suggests the possible use of genetic linkage analysis to test whether specific candidate genes contribute to the pathogenesis of either essential hypertension or intermediate phenotypes. Among such phenotypes, elevated erythrocyte Na(+)-Li+ countertransport (SLC) is the best known, supporting major gene inheritance by pedigree analysis. Striking similarities between SLC and Na(+)-H+ exchange suggest that mutations at the Na(+)-H+ antiporter gene locus (APNH) might result in elevated SLC and contribute to the subsequent pathogenesis of hypertension. We have tested these hypotheses by genetic linkage analysis, with APNH as a candidate gene. By determining genotypes at APNH and flanking loci in pedigrees that support major gene segregation of elevated SLC, we have excluded linkage of APNH and the major SLC locus with a LOD score of -5.91, an odds ratio of almost 1,000,000:1 against linkage. In the analysis of 93 hypertensive sibling pairs, we have further demonstrated that APNH explains none of the variance in SLC in hypertensive individuals (r2 = 6 x 10(-7), p greater than 0.99). Finally, we have directly tested for linkage of APNH to genes predisposing toward hypertension by linkage in hypertensive sibling pairs. Mean allele sharing at APNH is not greater than expected from random assortment in hypertensive siblings (0.92 versus 1.0, p greater than 0.80), and the upper 95% confidence limit of this value (1.04) indicates that mutations at APNH rarely if ever contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this population. 
2	Assay of hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction and its relationship to pre-S- and S-encoded viral surface antigens. The polymerase chain reaction was evaluated as a diagnostic tool in 72 chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detectable in the serum of HBsAg-positive virus carriers using aliquots as small as 100 al. The detection limit for cloned hepatitis B virus DNA was 100 ag. Primer pairs for different regions of the HBV genome resulted in different sensitivity. Detection of the amplified hepatitis B virus DNA by Southern blotting and subsequent scintillation counting or densitometry allowed a semiquantitative assay. Using several primer pairs in parallel for optimal detection, all HBeAg-positive HBsAg carriers, 80% of HBe antibody-positive symptomatic HBsAg carriers and 57% of asymptomatic HBe antibody-positive HBsAg carriers were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum. During antiviral therapy hepatitis B virus DNA disappeared by the polymerase chain reaction assay in patients who became HBeAg negative, but polymerase chain reaction detected a relapse earlier than did the conventional dot blot. Pre-S antigens were assayed in serum and liver samples from most chronic carriers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or immunoblot. Although most viremic carriers were strongly positive for pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens, some hepatitis B virus DNA-positive HBsAg carriers did not have detectable pre-S antigens, and vice versa. Our data show that assay of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum by polymerase chain reaction is by far more proficient than by dot blot and that it cannot be replaced by serological assays of HBeAg or pre-S antigen. 
4	Risk factors for gestational diabetes in black population. In a long-term longitudinal study of gestational diabetes mellitus in Black women, risk factors that were identified were age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of hypertension. Poor predictors were a history of a previous large-for-date infant, parity, and age at first pregnancy. The prevalence of smooth muscle and nuclear autoantibodies was higher in gestational diabetic subjects. Gestational diabetic subjects who required insulin for glycemic control were more obese, had a lower frequency of the Bf-F phenotype and a higher frequency of the Bf-F1 phenotype, and had a lower frequency of the type 2 allele at the polymorphic locus adjacent to the insulin gene. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms flanking the insulin and apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes, although not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, may be associated with hyperlipidemia and subsequent atherosclerosis. 
2	Pathogenesis and therapy of peptic ulcer disease. The epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum are normally protected from the damaging effects of acid and pepsin by a balancing mechanism of mucosal resistance. If an imbalance occurs, peptic ulcer may result. Traditional teaching has emphasized the importance of acid (and pepsin) as the cause of this imbalance; however, it is clear that acid and pepsin are not the only important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. More recent investigative efforts have been directed at what constitutes mucosal resistance and how it can be disrupted to produce, in the presence of gastric acid, a peptic ulcer. Depletion of endogenous prostaglandins and Helicobacter pylori gastritis have emerged as prominent theories. As evidence exists both to support and refute these theories in humans, any definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time. The acute management of peptic ulcer disease is directed at relieving pain, accelerating ulcer healing, and preventing complications. Peptic ulcers can be healed with antisecretory agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole), antacids, prostaglandins, and sucralfate. Because they are effective, safe, and convenient, the H2-receptor antagonists are the most widely used agents for the management of peptic ulcer disease. Because the H2-receptor antagonist agents are equally effective in their indicated uses and are equally safe based on scientifically valid data, selection should be based primarily on cost. Omeprazole is the newest antisecretory agent: a single morning dose of 20 mg suppresses acid secretion for 24 h. The agent offers little advantage over H2-receptor antagonists for the majority of patients with peptic ulcer. 
1	Carotid body tumors. The surgical management of carotid body tumors requires identification and preservation of neural and vascular structures without compromising resection of the neoplasm. Fifteen patients were examined and treated for carotid body tumors at the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation from 1979 through 1987. The benchmark of diagnosis is bilateral carotid angiography. When neural structures are free of tumor, meticulous dissection facilitates their preservation. Large tumor size increases risk for arterial resection necessitating reconstruction. The use of a vascular shunt minimizes the risk of cerebral ischemia. Postoperative intravenous digital subtraction angiography allows for evaluation of arterial repair. A retrospective review of 15 carotid body tumor resections performed in 14 patients revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence, no mortality associated with surgical intervention, no postoperative cerebrovascular accident, and limited morbidity associated with unavoidable sacrifice of neural elements. 
5	Glaucoma triple procedures: efficacy of intraocular pressure control and visual outcome. Sixty-three glaucoma triple surgeries [combined trabeculectomy, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), and posterior-chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation] were reviewed. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was controlled satisfactorily in all cases; 25% required additional glaucoma therapy but fewer glaucoma medications. Eighty-six percent achieved 6/12 or better visual acuity. Postoperative IOP and visual acuity results were similar to those achieved by trabeculectomy or ECCE/PC-IOL, respectively. Cumulative years of preoperative glaucoma therapy had an adverse effect on postoperative IOP control. 
3	Fibrillation potential amplitude and muscle atrophy following peripheral nerve injury. Maximum peak-to-peak fibrillation potential amplitude was measured in 69 subjects between 7 days and 10 1/2 years post complete or partial peripheral nerve injury. Mean amplitude during the first 2 months was 612 muV; third and fourth months 512 muV, fifth and sixth months 320 muV. After the first year, no population of fibrillation potentials greater than 100 muV was recorded. The sciatic nerve was sectioned in 13 guinea pigs and animals studied up to 17 weeks. Fibrillation potential amplitude in gastrocnemius muscles declined paralleling that in humans. By the end of the study, type I fibers had lost almost half of their initial diameter and type II fibers had atrophied more than twice this amount. Fibrillation potential amplitude may be useful in estimating the time post nerve injury and appears to correlate with the surface area and fiber diameter of a type I muscle fiber. 
1	Subclinical vulvar papillomavirus infection. Eighty-eight cases of subclinical human papillomavirus (HPV) vulvar infection were detected in a consecutive colposcopic series of 968 women. Three patterns of acetowhite lesions had a 72% predictive value (88/122) for histologically assessed HPV. The prevalence of subclinical vulvar HPV in self-referred patients was 7.9% (73/918); it was 9% (88/968) in the overall series and significantly higher in younger patients (age less than 25 years: 21/106, or 19.8%) or in those with cervical HPV or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (40/100, or 40%). Routine inspection of the vulva after acetic acid lavage in association with a Papanicolaou test might help identify Papanicolaou-test-negative patients at high risk of developing cervical HPV or CIN. Treatment with beta-interferon (2,000,000 IU daily intramuscularly for 10 days) was given to 30 consecutive patients, but the results were poor: regression was observed in only 2 cases. 
5	Vesicular changes in the myopathies of AIDS. Ultrastructural observations and their relationship to zidovudine treatment. Six patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) who developed neuromuscular symptoms associated with vesicular changes in muscle fibres are reported. Two patients in the advanced stages of AIDS, who did not receive zidovudine, developed proximal limb weakness and wasting: both had a necrotising myopathy with an unusual segmental vesicular change of myofibres. There were numerous vesicles 0.1 to 2 microns in diameter produced by dilatations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in fibres depleted of myofibrils. Four patients developed a myopathy while receiving zidovudine for AIDS. One of these had an inflammatory myopathy which showed the development of vesicular change due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria. The three other patients with ARC developed muscle pains or weakness and elevated serum CK while on zidovudine. These patients also showed vesicular changes due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria associated with disruption of sarcomeres and the presence of cytoplasmic bodies. The muscular symptoms resolved when ziduvodine was stopped and repeat biopsy in one case revealed no abnormalities. 
4	Identification of the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation. We continuously observed successive pairs of R-R intervals during atrial fibrillation and hypothesized that the shortest R-R interval for a given preceding R-R interval in a pair represents the functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node at that preceding interval. To test this hypothesis we simulated atrial fibrillation in 28 isolated cross-perfused canine hearts and obtained an R-R interval scatterplot by plotting the R-R intervals as a function of the immediately preceding R-R interval. This scatterplot enabled us to detect a series of the shortest R-R intervals for a wide range of preceding R-R intervals, and this allowed us to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation. The estimated functional refractory periods correlated well with those measured by the conventional method (r = 0.93). We conclude that the proposed method makes it possible to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory periods of the atrioventricular node in atrial fibrillation. 
5	A prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of temporomandibular joint arthroscopy. This is a prospective study to evaluate therapeutic arthroscopy for internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Fifty-nine patients with 76 abnormal joints were evaluated preoperatively for pain, noise, maximal incisal opening (MIO), and deviation on opening. Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for 29 joints. Patients were treated by superior joint arthroscopy, lysis of adhesions, lavage, and steroid injection, along with preoperative and postoperative splint and physiotherapy. Pain, noise, and motion were evaluated at three time periods: 1) early (10 to 30 days); 2) intermediate (1 to 6 months); and 3) late (greater than 6 months). At early, intermediate, and late follow-up, increase in MIO was statistically significant (P less than .05). Noise did not return in the majority of patients. Disc position, evaluated by MRI, did not appear to change in 25 of 29 joints and did not correlate with clinical outcome. The results of this study indicate that TMJ arthroscopy is effective in reducing pain and increasing motion in patients with TMJ internal derangement. 
2	Crypt cell proliferation and HLA-DR expression in pelvic ileal pouches. To investigate the nature of the morphological changes that occur in ileal pouches, 26 biopsy specimens from patients with functioning ileo-anal pouches (eight with pouchitis) were studied. Normal ileum (n = 10) was used as a control. Mucosal morphometry (using linear measurements), crypt cell proliferation (CCP) (using the monoclonal antibody Ki67), and epithelial HLA-DR expression (monoclonal antibody CR3/43) were assessed. CCP (expressed as the percentage of Ki67 positive nuclei for each crypt) was significantly higher in pouches with pouchitis, compared with those without, and in pouches without pouchitis compared with normal ileum. CCP values in some pouches without pouchitis approached values found in those with pouchitis. CCP was related inversely to villous height and an index of villous atrophy (VH/TMT), and directly to crypt depth. In the presence of pouchitis there was intense epithelial HLA-DR expression that extended into the crypts. In some pouches with high CCP values, but without clinically important inflammation, surface epithelial HLA-DR expression was weak and patchy. It is concluded that villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in ileal pouches are associated with high CCP values. These may be increased even in the absence of active inflammation, and this increase may occur as a response to the new luminal environment. 
5	Etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections in Gambian children: II. Acute lower respiratory tract infection in children ages one to nine years presenting at the hospital. Seventy-four children ages 1 to 9 years hospitalized because of severe pneumonia were investigated using blood cultures, lung aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirates, serology and antigen detection procedures. A bacterial infection was identified in 57 (77%), a viral infection was seen in 25 (34%) and 18 (24%) had mixed viral-bacterial infections. The bacterial pathogens most frequently identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae found in 61 and 15% of patients, respectively. The viral pathogen most frequently recovered was respiratory syncytial virus (12%). Evidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae strain TWAR and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in 12 and 4% of cases, respectively. Overall a potential pathogen was identified in 60 (81%) children, with evidence of polymicrobial infection in 30 cases (40.5%). The study provides information on the relative role of different infectious agents in the etiology of severe pneumonia in children in a developing country. 
3	Radiology for cochlear implants. One fifth of patients selected for cochlear implants have such bony irregularities in the cochlear duct that full insertion of a multichannel electrode array is impossible. Three cases of cochlear deafness are presented where pre- and post-operative radiology played an important part in the management. Standard CT at 2 mm cuts is compared with ultra high resolution CT at 1 mm cuts. The pitfall of poor definition is that the inexperienced surgeon may find himself unexpectedly drilling out an obliterated cochlear duct. Sections 30 degrees caudal to Reid's infra orbito-meatal base line at 1 mm intervals give maximum information for minimum radiation. Plain films show the placement of individual platinum electrode contacts in relation to the spiral 'frequency map' of the cochlea. This is vital information for the audiologist who has to route specific frequencies to specific sites within the ear for a good hearing result. 
4	Hypertension and diabetes in blacks. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interrelationship between non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension in our attempt to explore the pathophysiology of the high incidence of diabetes and hypertension in the Black population in the United States. A central role for hyperinsulinemia is proposed, and questions are raised that are suitable for investigative clinical trials. 
5	Defective oral tolerance promotes nephritogenesis in experimental IgA nephropathy induced by oral immunization. Oral tolerance, an important feature of the mucosal immune system, appears to protect against immune-mediated disease by blunting production of systemic IgG and IgM antibody directed toward immunogens chronically present at mucosal surfaces. In this study, we explored the role of oral tolerance and mucosal immunoregulation in an experimental model of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), an important form of nephritis in humans. Cyclophosphamide and estradiol were used to inhibit the expression of oral tolerance, which otherwise develops after chronic oral presentation of Ag. BALB/c mice given drinking water containing 0.1% bovine gamma globulin (BGG) continuously for 14 wk were randomly assigned to groups given either 2 mg of cyclophosphamide i.p., 2 mg of estradiol s.c. or both drugs. Groups of control mice received neither BGG nor drugs. In three separate experiments, a low percentage of saline-treated orally immunized mice had microscopic hematuria (0 to 20%), as did nonimmunized controls (0 to 20%). However, 58 to 83% of mice given estradiol and/or cyclophosphamide at appropriate times developed significant hematuria. If drugs were given at suboptimal times, only 25 to 56% of mice developed hematuria. Drug-treated immunized mice also had more serum IgG and IgM anti-BGG antibodies than control and saline groups. Immunofluorescence showed significantly more glomerular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 in drug-treated immunized mice compared to saline-treated immunized and normal untreated control mice. Hematuria and glomerular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 paralleled serum IgG and IgM antibody. All immunized mice showed significant mesangial IgA and BGG deposits and there were no differences in such deposits between saline- and drug-treated immunized mice. We suggest that blunting of oral tolerance with promotion of systemic IgG and IgM antibody production leads to nephritis in chronically orally immunized mice and that glomerular immune complexes containing IgG and/or IgM promote complement deposition and hematuria in IgAN. Analogous defects in oral (or more generally mucosal) tolerance could play a role in the genesis of symptomatic human IgAN. 
5	The use of the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart and the Symbion ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation. The proliferation of transplantation programs has not been paralleled by a similar increase in the availability of organ donors. Between 1984 and 1987, 104 orthotopic heart transplantations were performed at Loyola University Medical Center. During the same period, 25 patients died while awaiting a donor organ. To reduce the mortality, we began using the total artificial heart (TAH) and a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to transplantation in 1988. Of 29 patients who underwent transplantation, 15 patients required a TAH and three patients required a VAD as a bridge. The underlying heart conditions were ischemic cardiomyopathy (11 patients), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 patients), giant cell myocarditis (1 patient), and allograft failure (1 patient). The average duration of mechanical support was 10 days (range, 1 to 35 days). Of the 17 patients who successfully underwent transplantation, 1 patient died at 17 days because of acute rejection of the transplanted heart, and another patient died at 14 days because of a cerebral vascular event. Fifteen patients (83%) were long-term survivors. Nine patients required reoperation for bleeding. While the mechanical device was in place, the activated clotting time was maintained between 170 and 200 seconds with heparin. Dipyridamole was given. We conclude that the TAH and VAD are excellent mechanical bridges to transplantation. 
3	Hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. A case is presented of 14 year old female with hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. Evidence of hypothalamic obesity included 1) acute hyperphagia and weight gain, 2) neuroradiology showed hydrocephalus with focal enlargement of the third ventricle, 3) endocrinological studies revealed hyperinsulinaemia and impaired growth hormone (GH) response to arginine, but normal GH response to growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) and 4) Torkildsen's ventriculo-cisternal shunting resulted in improvement in hyperphagia and obesity. 
1	Lung cancer histology in Jews and Arabs in Israel, 1962-1982. Lung cancer rates in Israel are lower than in Western countries, not explainable by smoking habits. Because of the different relations of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma to smoking it was of interest to study the histologic distribution in Israel. A total of 7,871 histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were studied in the period 1962-1982. Squamous cell carcinoma was the leading tumor type in Jewish men and adenocarcinoma in Jewish women. Rates of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma increased throughout the period in both Jewish men and women, but the increase in adenocarcinoma was more pronounced in the last study period than that in squamous cell carcinoma. In 1977-1982 the rate ratio of squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma among Jewish men was 1.7. In Arab men it was 2.9, and in Jewish women 0.57. The Kreyberg I/II ratio among Jewish men was about 2.7 with no clear trend throughout the study period, and among Arab men this gradually decreased from 8.1 to 3.5. Jewish women had a constant Kreyberg I/II ratio of about 1 through the whole study period, but the ratio in Arab women was significantly higher than 1, with a mean overall ratio of 3.2. Jews and Arabs in Israel are different from each other in their patterns of lung cancer histology and are different to some extent from other populations in the Western world. 
4	Heart disease in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. Generally, heart disease death rates are lower in these population groups than in Caucasians, with the notable exception of Native Americans under the age of 35. Of particular interest are data for southwestern US Native Americans and Mexican-Americans, which indicate low CHD prevalence rates despite high rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing hypertension, and low socioeconomic status. Much more research is needed to explain these and other observations. Intervention in those risk factors already identified is necessary, particularly in prevention of obesity and diabetes. 
1	Fine-needle aspiration cytology and flow cytometry of intracystic papillary carcinoma of breast To define criteria for cytologic diagnosis of intracystic papillary carcinoma (ICPC), the authors retrospectively reviewed the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytologic specimens of eight cases of histologically proven ICPC of breast. The patients were five black and three white women, 56-87 years of age. The FNA specimen was cyst fluid in four cases (bloody in three, clear in one). All the aspirates showed cellular smears with small and large clusters of cells with papillary and/or cribriform configurations and numerous single epithelial cells. The cells were cuboidal to columnar with minimal atypia. ICPC was suggested by FNA in each case, and all the patients underwent surgical excision or mastectomy. Flow cytometry, performed on fresh FNA specimen in one case and on paraffin-embedded surgical tissue in all eight cases, showed seven tumors to be aneuploid and one to be diploid. The authors contend that ICPCs of breast have distinct cytomorphologic features that can be recognized by FNA. Because ICPC may present in cyst fluid, either bloody or clear, all breast cyst fluids from postmenopausal women should be examined cytologically. Flow cytometric demonstration of an aneuploid population may assist in confirming malignancy in this lesion. 
5	Host genetic influences on fetal susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus after maternal or fetal infection. Genetically determined resistance to murine cytomegalovirus is observed in adult mice and is mediated in part by genes of the H-2 complex, with the H-2k haplotype conferring resistance. This model was used to examine the effect of primary maternal infection on fetal outcome. The severity of fetal growth retardation and death after primary maternal infection on day 8 of pregnancy was found to be genetically determined. Fetal viability and weight were significantly lower in infected BALB/c mothers (H-2d) than in CBA(H-2k) and BALB.K(H-2k) mothers. However, fetal infection was not detected, suggesting that the resistance mechanisms operate at the level of the mother or placenta. By directly inoculating fetuses in utero, it was shown that genetic factors in the fetus can influence the level of fetal infection and viability. These results point to the possibility that host genetic factors may modulate maternal and fetal cytomegalovirus infections in humans. 
5	Factors associated with hemorrhage in cesarean deliveries. A case-control study was performed to study risk factors for hemorrhage in cesarean deliveries. Hemorrhage was defined by a pre- to post-delivery hematocrit decrease of 10 points or more or by the need for red-cell transfusion. Patients with antenatal bleeding were excluded. Among 3052 cesarean deliveries, hemorrhage occurred in 196 cases (6.4%). Three controls were matched to each case and multiple logistic regression was used to control for covariance among predictor variables. Factors having a significant association with hemorrhage were: general anesthesia (adjusted odds ratio 2.94), amnionitis (odds ratio 2.69), preeclampsia (2.18), protracted active phase of labor (2.40), second-stage arrest (1.90), and Hispanic ethnicity (1.82). After adjustment for these variables, a classic uterine incision had a small but significant association (odds ratio 1.06) with hemorrhage. Previous cesarean, parity, gestational age, and several other factors had no association with hemorrhage. These data allow one to anticipate hemorrhage in patients at risk and may be useful in planning appropriate use of blood bank resources, including antepartum autologous blood donation. 
5	Clinical experience with the Medtronic-Hall valve prosthesis. Medtronic-Hall valves were implanted during 204 procedures performed between 1982 and 1988. Mean population age was 54.4 years; 96% of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or greater. Emergency operations constituted 16% of the procedures. Rheumatic heart disease was the single most common indication for valve replacement. In 18% of patients, operation was performed to replace a previous prosthetic valve. The mean follow-up was 3.2 years. Overall operative mortality was 10.3%, the highest mortality being for double-valve replacements (24%). Valve-related mortality, by position, was 5.3% for aortic valves, 6.0% for mitral valves, and 4.0% for multiple-valve replacements. Actuarial 5-year freedom from events were: survival, 68%; thromboembolism, 90%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 98%; paravalvular leak, 95%; and reoperation, 92%. Complications with the highest mortality were thromboembolism (36%) and endocarditis (33%). The complication rates in this series are high but the patients were more severely ill than in other reports, and operative survivors experienced a considerable improvement in New York Heart Association functional class. 
5	Role of beta-adrenergic blockers after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) cannot currently be prevented. Different medical regimens have been largely unsuccessful. Experimental studies suggest roles for beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium antagonists. Controlled clinical studies have failed to show any decrease in restenosis rate for calcium antagonists. Corresponding studies for beta blockers are lacking. This study evaluates 541 consecutive PTCA procedures, 455 (86%) in patients treated with beta blockers after PTCA (76% metoprolol, 14% atenolol, 4% sotalol, 6% others) and 86 (14%) in patients without beta blockers. Angiographic success was achieved in 483 of 620 lesions (78%), and was not significantly different with or without beta blockers (79 vs 73%, p greater than 0.05). The procedure success rate and the complication rates (myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, death) did not differ with or without beta blockers (p greater than 0.05). Follow-up angiograms for 426 of the 483 successfully dilated lesions (88%) revealed that a total of 155 stenoses had recurred (36%). The restenosis rate was not significantly different with (368) or without (58) beta blockers (36 vs 38%, p greater than 0.05). For beta blockers with calcium antagonists (84% nifedipine, 13% diltiazem, 2% verapamil, 1% others), the restenosis rate was 97 of 250 (39%) vs 36 of 118 (31%) (p greater than 0.05). This retrospective study indicates that treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers after PTCA, alone or in combination with calcium antagonists, does not influence either the success rate or the restenosis rate and can be continued if indicated from an antiischemic viewpoint. 
4	Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity. 
2	Gallbladder surgery following cholecystlithotripsy: suggested guidelines for treatment Twenty-three of 229 symptomatic patients undergoing cholecystlithotripsy underwent surgical intervention: 22 of the patients had cholecystectomy performed (five also undergoing choledochotomy) and one patient had a cholecystostomy. Of these 23 patients, five were lithotripsy failures, five developed acute pancreatitis, one had acute cholecystitis, and one had cholangitis. One patient had her gallbladder removed incidentally at the time of surgery for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Ten patients underwent surgery for recurrent biliary pain, probably related to fragment passage via the cystic duct. We suggest that up to 16 of these 23 patients did not necessarily require cholecystectomy, i.e. five patients with pancreatitis, one patient with cholangitis and ten patients with recurrent biliary colic. Conservative and/or endoscopic management may be successful in the first instance to allow further treatment with lithotripsy in the majority of patients. If, however, the expertise to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy is not available or the patient declines further lithotripsy, then resort to surgery may be necessary. We propose that it is the responsibility of the management team in charge of the lithotripsy unit to inform both the patient and the referring clinicians of the possible side-effects and outcome of treatment in an attempt to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. 
4	Neurovascular mechanisms and sodium balance in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Physiological studies have clarified the role that the brain has in the interplay between salt balance and hypertension. Neural mechanisms and endocrine secretions play a pivotal role in the adaptation of mammals to changes in the intake and excretion of sodium. Maneuvers that alter the concentration of sodium in the plasma modify the sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes and alter vascular reactivity. These changes may be mediated in part by the release of vasopressin. The research also suggests that the brain indirectly modulates the ability of the vascular endothelium to release vasoactive factors. Collectively, these studies illustrate the multiple effects of the sodium ion on the peripheral neural and central endocrine mechanisms that participate in the regulation of arterial pressure. 
2	Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dengue fever. Twenty-six virologically and serologically confirmed Dengue patients with signs of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (13.1%) were studied during the 1987 outbreak in southern Taiwan. Within a 1-yr period from 1987 to 1988 in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, there were 198 patients with Dengue fever confirmed. Viral isolation and serological studies indicated that type I Dengue was the cause. There was no evidence of sequential secondary infection among them. The 26 patients were evaluated gastroduodenoscopically. Most of the Dengue patients who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding had gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers; superficial and hemorrhagic gastritis are the other relevant endoscopic findings. Thirteen patients (50%) had a past history of peptic ulcer symptoms, whereas the other 13 did not. Dengue infection is a precipitating factor in inducing peptic ulcer bleeding because of hemostatic derangements. Supportive therapy and blood transfusions alone were adequate treatment, except for one patient who required surgery due to massive bleeding of a duodenal ulcer. No mortality was observed in this study. 
5	Anorectal dysfunction in patients with urologic disturbance due to multiple sclerosis. Anorectal function was evaluated in 11 patients with voiding dysfunction due to multiple sclerosis. In six patients with constipation, three also had symptoms of obstructed defecation and one patient was incontinent due to stercoral diarrhea. One patient was only fecal incontinent and one patient had obstructed defecation as the only symptom. Three patients had no anorectal symptoms. Anal manometry in the women compared with a control group revealed significant lower anal resting and squeeze pressures, although no significant difference of rectal sensation to distention with air was found. Pudendal nerve terminal latencies were obtained in seven patients and were all normal. In four patients latency could not be demonstrated due to poor contraction of the sphincter on stimulation of the pudendal nerve. Two of these patients were incontinent and two had both constipation and obstructed defecation. It is concluded that patients with voiding symptoms due to multiple sclerosis often reveal anorectal symptoms or motility disorders. Although anal sphincter function is reduced, fecal incontinence is not prevalent in this group. The reason for this lies probably in the fact that many of the patients are constipated, thus securing fecal continence. 
1	Vaginal mullerian cyst presenting as an anterior enterocele: a case report. A case is discussed of an extremely large vaginal mullerian cyst that presented as an anterior enterocele. Sonographic and radiologic studies are described. The patient underwent operative excision of the cyst with reconstructive vaginoplasty. 
4	Effects of long-term treatment with metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure. Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups. Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment. A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol. In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively. In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period. We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease. 
1	Subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer in New Zealand, 1974-1983. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts. 
4	Prognostic value of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with unstable angina who respond to medical treatment [published erratum appears in J Am Coll Cardiol 1991 Sep;18(3):889] Although the prognostic value of thallium-201 imaging is well established, its ability to risk stratify patients who present with unstable angina is unclear. Fifty-two consecutive patients admitted with unstable angina who responded to medical treatment and underwent stress thallium-201 imaging within 1 week of discharge were studied. Patients were followed up for 39 +/- 11 months. Cardiac events included cardiac death (n = 3), nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 4) and admission for unstable angina or revascularization (n = 17). The ability of thallium-201 data (redistribution, fixed defects, normal) to predict cardiac events was compared with clinical data (age, gender, prior myocardial infarction, anginal syndrome, rest and stress electrocardiogram) and cardiac catheterization data using logistic regression. Thallium-201 redistribution was the only significant predictor of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05). The number of myocardial segments with thallium-201 redistribution (p less than 0.0005) and a history of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) were the only significant predictors of all cardiac events. Cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred more frequently in patients with thallium-201 redistribution (6 [26%] of 23) than in those without redistribution (1 [3%] of 29, p less than 0.05). Similarly, total cardiac events developed more frequently in patients with thallium-201 redistribution (p less than 0.001). Stress thallium-201 imaging has important prognostic value in patients admitted with unstable angina who respond to medical therapy and can identify subgroups at high versus low risk for future cardiac events. 
1	Type II oestrogen binding sites in human colorectal carcinoma. Seven cases of colorectal adenocarcinomas were investigated for the presence of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors. The tumours specifically bound oestradiol. This binding almost exclusively resulted from the presence of high numbers of type II oestrogen binding sites. Oestrogen receptors were absent or present at very low concentrations. Immunohistochemical investigation of nuclear oestrogen receptors gave negative results. This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites. The presence of specific type II oestrogen binding sites and progesterone binding offers further evidence for a potential role for these steroids and their receptors in colorectal carcinoma. 
2	Candidacidal activity of Crohn's disease neutrophils. The ability of normal and Crohn's disease neutrophils to kill Candida albicans has been studied using neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood and suspended in phosphate buffered saline at 5 x 10(6) cells per ml. C albicans was grown to a stationary phase in broth culture and suspended in phosphate buffered saline at 10(7) organisms/ml. Neutrophils and Candida were then incubated together at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath in the presence of fresh serum. At 30 and 60 minutes samples were withdrawn, neutrophils lysed, and Candida survival assessed by colony counting. Results were compared with control suspensions of Candida incubated with serum alone. After 30 and 60 minutes in the presence of autologous serum normal neutrophils had killed significantly more Candida than Crohn's disease neutrophils (mean (SD) 61.0 (16.7)% v 40.5 (16.2)% at 30 minutes, p less than 0.0001; 83.2 (7)% v 70.8) 16)% at 60 minutes, p less than 0.005). The results did not alter significantly when normal neutrophils were incubated with Candida in the presence of Crohn's disease serum instead of normal serum. When Crohn's disease neutrophils were incubated with Candida in the presence of normal serum instead of autologous serum there was some improvement in candidacidal ability at 30 minutes (48.9 (20.6)% v 40.5 (16.2)%, p less than 0.03) but not at 60 minutes. Phagocytosis, measured using a radiometric assay, was normal. Neutrophils from patients with Crohn's disease have an impaired ability to kill this granuloma provoking organism. It is not due to serum inhibitors or defective phagocytosis. 
2	Extrahepatic biliary obstruction by lymphoma. Extrinsic compression of the common bile duct by enlarged lymph nodes is an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice. We describe two patients with such a manifestation of lymphoma and the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in distinguishing this rare complication from other causes of jaundice in lymphoma. Patients may have rapid resolution of both symptoms and biochemical abnormalities by nonoperative biliary bypass combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Lymphomatous obstruction should be considered a cause of potentially treatable jaundice in patients with known lymphoma; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be valuable as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. 
1	Relationship of transfusion and infectious complications after gastric carcinoma operations. To determine the effect of transfusion on the incidence of postoperative infection, a retrospective cohort study of 196 patients who underwent surgery for gastric carcinoma in the period from 1985 through 1989 was carried out. Seventy-one patients (36.2%) developed postoperative septic complications; they had received an average of 4.2 blood units, as compared with 2.7 units received by patients not affected (p less than 0.0053). The hypothesis of dose-response relationship is supported by the Mantel-Haenszel test, as applied to the overall results (p less than 0.01) and the results grouped by duration of operation (p less than 0.02). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis shows transfusion to be an independent risk factor in the incidence of infection (p less than 0.01), as are antibiotic prophylaxis (p less than 0.015), urinary tract catheterization (p less than 0.002), and the duration of surgery (p less than 0.027). This significance is attained after adjustment for age, gender, period of evolution of symptoms; preoperative infection(s), number of white cells, hemoglobin level and total proteins on diagnosis, location of tumor, tumor, nodes, and metastasis staging, operative technique, drainage of the area of operation, enteral nutrition, and the histologic studies and macroscopic appearance of the tumor. This study is further evidence that transfusion may cause an increased incidence of postoperative infection. 
5	Time course of improvement in ventricular function after ablation of incessant automatic atrial tachycardia. A patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and supraventricular tachycardia presumed to be of sinus origin was referred for cardiac transplantation. The extreme rate of the tachycardia during exercise, profound fluctuations in heart rate, and the presence of an abnormal P wave axis suggested the diagnosis of incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia rather than compensatory sinus tachycardia. Electrophysiologic study with endocardial activation sequence mapping confirmed the diagnosis of an ectopic left atrial automatic tachycardia, after which surgical cryoablation of the left atrial focus was carried out successfully and sinus rhythm was restored. Serial radionuclide angiocardiograms obtained before and after surgery demonstrated a very rapid recovery of left ventricular function to nearly normal within the first month after surgery, followed by further improvement to normal over the next several months. The diagnosis of tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy should be seriously considered in any patient with apparently end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and persistent resting tachycardia. 
5	Quantification of biomedical findings of chronic pain patients: development of an index of pathology. Difficulties in assessing and quantifying the biomedical signs and symptoms that may be related to patients' reports of pain are well recognized. Although there appears to be some consensus among physicians as to the potential utility of examination and diagnostic tests frequently used to evaluate chronic pain patients, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interpreting the results of these procedures. Moreover, the integration of biomedical findings to form a general index of pathology associated with chronic pain has been a difficult problem to solve because not all biomedical procedures used to evaluate pain patients are necessarily relevant or indicated for a specific patient. Two studies are presented that were designed to evaluate the reliability of 23 biomedical procedures commonly used to evaluate chronic pain patients and to determine if findings on these procedures can effectively be combined to form a reliable index of physical pathology. The results of study 1 suggest that 17 of the 23 procedures can be applied in clinical setting with acceptable levels of reliability. Study 2 provides evidence that an innovative weighted scoring approach, based on current medical consensus, can be used to produce a reliable, general index of pathology that is independent of the number of procedures used to evaluate patients. The utility of this quantification approach to biomedical findings for clinical and research purposes is discussed. 
5	Microvascular pedal bypass for salvage of the severely ischemic limb Bypass to the pedal arteries was performed with use of the operating microscope and standard microsurgical technique in 37 patients with severe, chronic ischemia of a lower extremity. Twenty-one patients (57%) had three or more cardiovascular risk factors, and 22 (59%) had diabetes. Preoperative arteriography identified a pedal artery suitable for bypass in all but one patient. The greater or lesser saphenous vein was used in all patients, most frequently as a nonreversed, translocated vein graft. An arm vein was used as part of a composite graft in only one patient. No early deaths occurred, and only one patient had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Although five grafts occluded within 30 days, four were successfully revised, and 36 patients had a patent graft at the time of dismissal from the hospital. At 1 year, the primary graft patency rate (patency without revision) was 60.8%, and the secondary patency rate was 68.8%. One early and six late amputations were performed; the cumulative 1-year limb salvage rate was 82.4%. Grafts with an intraoperative flow rate of 50 ml/min or more had a better patency rate than those with a lower flow rate. The presence of diabetes did not adversely affect long-term patency. Of the 34 patients who were alive at the time of this report, 27 (79%) had a functional foot that allowed ambulation, had no rest pain, and had no substantial loss of tissue. Pedal bypass should be considered for critical, chronic ischemia, even if the patient has an increased surgical risk and advanced distal atherosclerotic disease. 
5	Argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation side effects on the anterior segment. The modification of corneal sensitivity, accommodation, pupillary diameter and endothelial cell density after argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation were studied prospectively in 88 eyes of 64 diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, randomized for one of the two laser treatments. In both groups a marked internal ophthalmoplegia and reduction of corneal sensitivity occurred after laser photocoagulation. At no time, 2, 90 and 180 days after PRP, were these parameters significantly different. Endothelial cell loss was non significantly greater in the krypton group. The results indicated that the side effects commonly observed on the anterior segment after PRP are comparable using argon or krypton lasers. 
1	Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated "insular" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. 
5	The influence of calcium alginate haemostatic swabs upon operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Although adenotonsillectomy is regarded as a minor procedure, it has been shown that 18% of patients may experience an operative blood loss of 10-20% of the total blood volume. The aim of this study was to determine whether calcium alginate haemostatic swabs reduce operative blood loss in adenotonsillectomy. Seventy-two patients (ages 2-12 years) entered a prospective trial in which the operation was performed either with normal gauze swabs or calcium alginate swabs. Thirty-six children were randomized to each group. The mean blood loss was found to be 34.9 ml (2.07% of total blood volume) and 47.8 ml (2.97% of total blood volume) respectively. Although there was no significant reduction in operative blood loss using calcium alginate, in both groups the blood loss was much smaller than that stated by the majority of previous workers. 
2	Can clinicians accurately assess esophageal dilation without fluoroscopy? This study questioned whether clinicians could determine the success of esophageal dilation accurately without the aid of fluoroscopy. Twenty patients were enrolled with the diagnosis of distal esophageal stenosis, including benign peptic stricture (17), Schatski's ring (2), and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (1). Dilation attempts using only Maloney dilators were monitored fluoroscopically by the principle investigator, the physician and patient being unaware of the findings. Physicians then predicted whether or not their dilations were successful, and they examined various features to determine their usefulness in predicting successful dilation. They were able to predict successful dilation accurately in 97% of the cases studied; however, their predictions of unsuccessful dilation were correct only 60% of the time. Features helpful in predicting passage included easy passage of the dilator (98%) and the patient feeling the dilator in the stomach (95%). Excessive resistance suggesting unsuccessful passage was an unreliable feature and was often due to the dilator curling in the stomach. When Maloney dilators are used to dilate simple distal strictures, if the physician predicts successful passage, he is reliably accurate without the use of fluoroscopy; however, if unsuccessful passage is suspected, fluoroscopy must be used for confirmation. 
5	Significance of discordant ST alternans in ventricular fibrillation. With the use of epicardial mapping, we investigated the electrical alternans of the ST segment during acute myocardial ischemia and studied the difference in ST alternans between dogs with resultant ventricular fibrillation and those without it. During the 7-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery below its first diagonal branch, 60 epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously at 1-minute intervals by a computerized mapping system. ST alternans was found in the eight dogs we observed. The amplitude of ST alternans (difference in the ST segment elevation of two consecutive electrograms) was greater in dogs with ventricular fibrillation (n = 4) than in those without it (n = 4) (3.92 +/- 1.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.49 mV, p less than 0.05). Three of the four dogs with ventricular fibrillation demonstrated discordant ST alternans (i.e., adjacent leads were out of phase). Results from the present study indicate that an increased amplitude and discordance of ST alternans during acute myocardial ischemia are related to ventricular fibrillation and act as indicators of time and spatial unevenness of ventricular repolarization. 
4	Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease--a case report. A fifty-three-year-old woman presented with coronary artery aneurysm in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) manifested also by large pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. The arterial dye dilution curves were unusually distorted owing to the right-to-left shunts. The coronary artery aneurysm was located in multiple sites but was not accompanied by stenotic lesions. Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis is a rare pathologic state and has not been previously reported in association with hereditary telangiectasia. 
5	Ectopic retinoblastoma within the 3rd ventricle: case report. Ectopic intracranial retinoblastomas are rare. These tumors usually occur in the pineal, parasellar, or suprasellar regions several years after the successful treatment of ocular retinoblastomas with no evidence of direct extension or distant metastasis. We report here a case of ectopic retinoblastoma occurring within the third ventricle. The tumor was surgically excised by the transventricular approach. Ectopic retinoblastomas exhibit greater differentiation than one would expect to observe in a metastatic lesion of this tumor. The distinction of ectopic retinoblastomas and metastasis from ocular retinoblastomas is important, since ectopic retinoblastomas, unlike metastasis, can be successfully managed by intensive therapy including radical excision. 
5	Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur. 
5	Diagnostic value of brush cytology in the diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma: a study in 65 patients with bile duct strictures. Malignant strictures of the extrahepatic bile ducts are difficult to distinguish from benign strictures, particularly in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma. Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period. Each had at least one brushing. Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures. Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy. Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings. Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells. Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing. In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found. However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing. A single negative or suspicious cytological finding decreased the probability of bile duct carcinoma to 43%. Two and three sequential negative tests reduced the probability to 32% and 0%, respectively. 
5	Alanine-based oral rehydration therapy for infants with acute diarrhea. Twenty male infants less than 1 year of age with acute diarrhea and dehydration were randomly assigned to a study group and studied in blind fashion in a metabolic unit to assess the efficacy of the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) oral rehydration solution (ORS). Patients were exclusively rehydrated with one of two types of ORS during the first 24 hours of treatment. On the second day, oral feedings were started with a lactose-free formula, and ORS was given to replace stool losses. Body weight, ORS, food intake, vomitus, stool, and urine output were recorded at 6-hour intervals. Blood was drawn at the time of admission, after rehydration, and at 24 and 48 hours of hospitalization to monitor blood gases and electrolytes. Rehydration was satisfactory in both groups of patients. ORS that contained alanine did not reduce the purging rates of the infants compared with those who received standard ORS. Clinically no adverse effect of the alanine-based ORS was observed during hospitalization. None of the patients had significant hypernatremia or hyponatremia, and serum amino acid levels were not altered. These data show that the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard WHO-ORS produces no further improvement in the outcome of the infants with acute diarrhea compared with those fed the standard WHO-ORS. 
3	Mastalgia refractory to drug treatment. Management of the patient with mastalgia who fails to respond to first line therapy is a difficult problem and there is a group of patients who do not respond to any therapy. A group of 126 patients with mastalgia who failed to respond to first line therapy and completed further treatment options was studied. The response rate of those with cyclical mastalgia fell to 57 and 25 per cent for second and third line therapy respectively. Equivalent figures for non-cyclical mastalgia were 24 and 21 per cent. Danazol maintains a high response rate after the failure of other drugs, whereas the second line response to bromocriptine and evening primrose oil is poor. Unresponsive patients were matched to a group of patients who responded to first line therapy, and reproductive and historical factors were compared using the chi 2 test, but failed to identify which patients would respond to therapy. 
3	Dementia: what to do. Dementia is a syndrome of acquired intellectual deterioration that interferes with personal or social functioning. Diagnosis requires historical information from the family and the mental status evaluation of orientation, recent memory, comprehension, calculation, and abstraction. Most dementias create permanent, even progressive cognitive deterioration, yet there are some presentations for which remission exists. Common reversible conditions include depression, drug toxicity, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, subdural hematoma, and neoplasm. Screening laboratory studies consist of urinalysis, chemistry profile, blood count, thyroid survey, vitamin B12 and folate measurements, serology, chest roentgenogram, computerized tomographic scan of the head, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram. Treatment focuses on potential reversibility, psychosocial issues, restoring deficits, and specific symptoms. 
1	Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity in B and T chronic lymphoid leukemia: defective LAK generation and reduced susceptibility of the leukemic cells to allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors. The capacity to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to both allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors were studied in B and T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. While in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) the depressed natural killer function could be restored after a 7-day incubation with recombinant interleukin (IL-2), B-CLL mononuclear cells showed a reduced LAK activity compared with normal LAK cells. Furthermore, in all but 1 of the 20 B-CLL samples tested the leukemic cells were totally resistant to autologous LAK effectors. In most cases the leukemic cells were also resistant to normal allogeneic LAK cells. Competition experiments demonstrated that the patients' LAK cells, as well as normal LAK effectors, were capable of recognizing B-CLL cells, pointing, therefore, to a postbinding cytolytic defect. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) an overall reduced LAK activity against allogeneic targets was documented, but, at variance from B-CLL, hairy cells were often susceptible to the lytic effect of normal LAK cells, and in half of the cases tested the neoplastic population was also sensitive in an autologous system. Similarly to B-CLL, in the great majority of T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders studied, the pathologic cells were resistant to normal and autologous LAK effectors and a defective LAK generation was found. These results demonstrate that in most B and T chronic leukemias the LAK function is defective and, when inducible, does not appear directed against the leukemic population. The possibility of exploiting an immunotherapeutic approach with IL-2/LAK cells in the management of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders does not gain support by these findings. 
5	Extravesical versus Leadbetter-Politano ureteroneocystostomy: a comparison of urological complications in 320 renal transplants. The urological complications of 320 consecutive renal transplants performed at our institution between October 17, 1985 and November 10, 1989 are reviewed. The Leadbetter-Politano technique of ureteroneocystostomy was used in the first 160 patients (group 1) and an anterior extravesical technique modified from the methods of Witzel, Sampson and Lich was performed in the second 160 patients (group 2). Urological complications occurred in 15 patients (9.4%) in group 1 and 6 (3.7%) in group 2 (p = 0.04). Ureterovesical junction obstruction occurred in 6 patients (3.7%) in group 1 and 1 (0.6%) in group 2 (p = 0.05). Complications of leakage, ureteral necrosis and ureteral stricture were comparable in the 2 groups. Therefore, we advocate the use of the anterior extravesical technique over Leadbetter-Politano ureteral reimplantation based on the lower incidence of urological complications and various technical advantages, including less operative time, avoidance of a separate cystotomy, less hematuria and ability to use short donor ureters. 
3	Immunoglobulins from animal models of motor neuron disease and from human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients passively transfer physiological abnormalities to the neuromuscular junction. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating human disease of upper and lower motoneurons of unknown etiology. In support of the potential role of autoimmunity in ALS, two immune-mediated animal models of motoneuron disease have been developed that resemble ALS with respect to the loss of motoneurons, the presence of IgG within motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction, and with respect to altered physiology of the motor nerve terminal. To provide direct evidence for the primary role of humoral immunity, passive transfer with immunoglobulins from the two animal models and human ALS was carried out. Mice injected with serum or immunoglobulins from the animal disease models and human ALS but not controls demonstrated IgG in motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction. The mice also demonstrated an increase in miniature end-plate potential (mepp) frequency, with normal amplitude and time course and normal resting membrane potential, indicating an increased resting quantal release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal. The ability to transfer motoneuron dysfunction with serum immunoglobulins provides evidence for autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both the animal models and human ALS. 
4	Acebutolol effects on lipid profile [published erratum appears in Am J Cardiol 1990 Dec 1;66(19):A8] The relation between lipid profile and the incidence of coronary artery disease has been confirmed by the results of epidemiologic and intervention studies. Among antihypertensive agents, beta blockers, particularly those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), are generally reported to have negative effects on lipids, which may increase the risk of coronary artery disease. The ongoing Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study, now in its third year, has evaluated 847 patients to date with regard to lipid profile. Additional end points measured in this multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind study include blood pressure reduction and target organ deterioration. During the trial, all patients received nutritional and behavioral counselling to modify their diet, exercise habits and alcohol and sodium consumption to control their hypertension by nonpharmacologic means. In addition, some patients were randomized to receive low doses of 1 of the 5 classes of antihypertensive medication: acebutolol, a beta blocker with ISA (n = 124); amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker (n = 122); chlorthalidone, a diuretic (n = 125); doxazosin, an alpha blocker (n = 128); enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 127) or placebo (n = 221). At 1 year, acebutolol showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in total cholesterol (-12.7 mg/dl) compared with placebo (-5.2 mg/dl) and with chlorthalidone (1.0 mg/dl); a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-6.0 mg/dl) compared with placebo (+0.7 mg/dl) and with chlorthalidone (+8.0 mg/dl) and no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.4 mg/dl). 
5	Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to inhibit the adhesive phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells for human PBL, purified T lymphocytes, and PHA-activated lymphoblasts. TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells. However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells. These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier. 
3	The relationship between viral RNA, myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in central nervous system disease during Theiler's virus infection. The DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (DAV) causes a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible mouse strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis of DAV-induced demyelination, the authors investigated the spatial and chronologic relationship between virus (antigen and RNA), myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in DAV-infected mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and slot blot hybridization analyses. In spinal cord white matter, viral RNA was detected easily in ventral root entry zones 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Viral RNA increased to maximum levels by 4 weeks after infection, which was associated with inflammation and mild demyelination. At 8 to 12 weeks after infection, when demyelination became most extensive, viral RNA was significantly decreased. Demyelination did not chronologically or spatially parallel the presence of viral RNA within the spinal cord. Decrease of myelin-specific mRNAs, including myelin-basic protein and proteolipid protein mRNAs, was observed within the demyelinating lesions with or without detectable viral RNA. These results indicate that a viral infection of white matter in the early phase of the infection initiates spinal cord disease leading to demyelination, but later an ongoing immunopathologic process contributes to the presence of extensive demyelination. 
5	Infantile acute hemorrhagic edema of the skin: study of ten cases. Infantile acute hemorrhagic edema of the skin is not included as a separate entity in the current English-language literature as it is in continental Europe. Therefore we have attempted to clarify the nosologic position of acute hemorrhagic edema among cutaneous vasculitides in children, on the basis of our experience in 10 cases. Our study confirms that acute hemorrhagic edema affects infants between 4 and 24 months of age. The two main features are an ecchymotic purpura, often in a cockade pattern, and an inflammatory edema of the limbs and face. Visceral involvement is uncommon. Spontaneous and complete resolution occurs within 1 to 3 weeks; one to four attacks may occur. Histopathologic examination demonstrates a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Perivascular IgA deposits can occasionally be found. Besides typical acute hemorrhagic edema, some cases in 2- to 4-year-old children appear to overlap with Schonlein-Henoch purpura. We suggest that typical acute hemorrhagic edema should be regarded as a separate clinical entity. This allows an appropriate prognosis to be made for this generally benign disease of infants. 
1	Vascular lesions of the intestines. This article reviews the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vascular lesions of the intestine as a cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, a modified system for classifying such lesions, based on the author's personal experience with such lesions, is presented. 
3	Headache and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Because the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus is neurotropic, physicians will continue to see a rise in the number of neurologic complications of this syndrome. Much of this increase will be accompanied by headache, not only as a primary symptom of HIV infection or opportunistic disease but also as a result of diagnostic tests and therapeutic efforts. Complete understanding of the ramifications of headache in AIDS will be important in the 1990s as we continue to treat a younger population, usually affected by benign vascular and muscle contraction-type headache. 
4	Right pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. Serial assessment of pulmonary artery flow by Doppler echocardiography was carried out in 15 infants after pulmonary artery banding. Three infants were identified as having branch pulmonary artery obstruction based on diastolic pulmonary artery flow. It is concluded that this flow profile may be specific for branch pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. 
3	Complications of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography. This study reviewed the technical complication of 112 cases of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography for cervical spinal cord disorders. Spinal cord puncture and contrast injection, puncture between the occiput and C1, and blood vessel puncture were the main complications. These principally depended on the positioning of the patient's neck (hyperextension) and misdirection of the x-ray beam. For preventing major arterial puncture, the authors also reviewed 164 vertebral angiograms and determined the pathway of the vertebral arteries and the incidence of anomaly. 
5	Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a prospective follow-up study. Endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters including presence of varices in the gastric fundus, red color sign, diameter and number of variceal columns, platelet count, and the Child status were assessed in 109 patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices without previous variceal bleeding. During a mean follow-up period of 21 months, the predictive values of these parameters with regard to first bleeding incidence and mortality rate were studied. The incidence of bleeding was 29%, and the mortality rate 46%. Endoscopic criteria (presence of varices in the gastric fundus, presence of the red color sign, and size of the largest varix) as well as alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis showed a significant positive correlation with the bleeding incidence but not with mortality. Contrary to this, two factors of the Child classification (encephalopathy and ascites) and age positively correlated with mortality but not with the bleeding incidence. 
3	Four chromosomal breakpoints and four new probes mark out a 10-cM region encompassing the fragile-X locus (FRAXA). We report the validation and use of a cell hybrid panel which allowed us a rapid physical localization of new DNA probes in the vicinity of the fragile-X locus (FRAXA). Seven regions are defined by this panel, two of which lie between DXS369 and DXS296, until now the closest genetic markers that flank FRAXA. Of those two interesting regions, one is just distal to DXS369 and defined by probe 2-71 (DXS476), which is not polymorphic. The next one contains probes St677 (DXS463) and 2-34 (DXS477), which are within 130 kb and both detect TaqI RFLPs. The combined informativeness of these two probes is 30%. We cloned from an irradiation-reduced hybrid line another new polymorphic probe, Do33 (DXS465; 42% heterozygosity). This probe maps to the DXS296 region, proximal to a chromosomal breakpoint that corresponds to the Hunter syndrome locus (IDS). The physical order is thus Cen-DXS369-DXS476-(DXS463,DXS477)-(DXS296, DXS465)-IDS-DXS304-tel. We performed a linkage analysis for five of these markers in both the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and in a large set of fragile-X families. This establishes that DXS296 is distal to FRAXA. The relative position of DXS463 and DXS477 with respect to FRAXA remains uncertain, but our results place them genetically halfway between DXS369 and DXS304. Thus the DXS463-DXS477 cluster defines presently either the closest proximal or the closest distal polymorphic marker with respect to FRAXA. The three new polymorphic probes described here have a combined heterozygosity of 60% and represent a major improvement for genetic analysis of fragile-X families, in particular for diagnostic applications. 
5	Hypoxemia in the postanesthesia care unit: an observer study To determine the incidence and duration of hypoxemia in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 200 patients were investigated in a single-blind observer study. The number of unrecognized hypoxemic episodes, as well as risk factors and possible association between hypoxemia and postoperative morbidity, were studied. Oxygenation was monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter. One or more hypoxemic episodes (SpO2 less than or equal to 90%) were noted in 55% of the patients. SpO2 values less than or equal to 80% were noted in 13% of the patients. Supplementary oxygen was given during 55% of the 447 hypoxemic episodes registered. The hypoxemic episodes were unrecognized by the staff in 95% of the cases. With stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, risk factors associated with a higher incidence of hypoxemia were: duration of anesthesia (P less than 0.0001), age (P less than 0.002) and a history of smoking (P less than 0.01). Patients who had undergone regional anesthesia had a lower risk of hypoxemia (P less than 0.0002). The occurrence of hypoxemia in the PACU could not be correlated to postoperative morbidity. We conclude that hypoxemic episodes in our PACU are common and that the routine use of supplemental oxygen combined with normal clinical surveillance did not prevent hypoxemic episodes. 
3	Diagnostic utility of lower extremity radiographs of young children with gait disturbance. The diagnostic utility of lower extremity radiographs was evaluated using 84 outpatients 1 to 5 years of age with gait disturbance whose lower extremities appeared physically normal. Chief complaints included limp (65 children [77%]), refusal to walk or stand (37 children [44%]), and frequent falling (6 children [7%]). A total of 43 children (51%) had more than one complaint. The mean age of patients was 26 months and the median duration of symptoms was 1 day. Trauma was reported in 43 (51%) cases and fever in 14 (17%). Results of radiographical studies appeared normal in 81 children (96%), demonstrated soft tissue swelling in 2 children, and revealed a bony island in 1 child. In 1 patient admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive and irritability, and whose radiographic results appeared normal, findings consistent with osteomyelitis later developed. Of the remaining children, 68 (81%) were available for follow-up observation 4 to 28 months after the initial visit and all reported spontaneous resolution of the initial complaint. It was concluded that in a well-appearing child with an otherwise normal physical examination results, an acute gait disturbance is likely to be a self-limiting condition and radiographs are unlikely to contribute to the diagnosis. 
4	Comparison of sublingual captopril and nifedipine in immediate treatment of hypertensive emergencies. A randomized, single-blind clinical trial. Sublingual captopril (25 mg) was compared with sublingual nifedipine (10 mg) to determine their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. In nine of 10 patients who received sublingual captopril, mean (+/- SD) systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 245 +/- 39 to 190 +/- 25 mm Hg (P less than .0025) and from 144 +/- 8 to 115 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .001) at 50 minutes, respectively. The hypotensive effect of the drug was maintained for a mean of 4 hours. In six of nine responders to sublingual captopril, blood pressure-lowering effect was associated with a clear improvement of end-organ failure within 60 minutes. There were no side effects, including a dangerous fall in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. Sublingual nifedipine lowered diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure in eight of 10 patients. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was more rapid than that of captopril (10 vs 20 minutes for diastolic blood pressure and 20 vs 30 minutes for systolic blood pressure, respectively), but no difference was observed in the time or in the magnitude of peak hypotensive effect between the two treatments, nor was a difference observed in the duration of hypotensive effect. In six of eight responders to nifedipine therapy, a clear improvement of symptoms and signs of end-organ failure was observed within 60 minutes. In three patients, minor side effects were observed. We conclude that sublingual captopril effectively and safely lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergencies. 
4	Systolic Hypertension of the Elderly Program (SHEP). Part 10: Analysis. The SHEP is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will follow standard clinical trial principles in analyzing data relating to its proposed hypotheses. The protocol has stated a priori the main objective as well as the secondary subgroup hypotheses. Sample size calculations for SHEP have accounted for dropins to and drop-outs from active therapy as well as for the risk of nonstroke death. The sample size achieved (4,736 participants) should be adequate to address the proposed questions. Monitoring procedures have been described and established. A data and safety monitoring board that uses these procedures is closely following the data from the trial. The board will periodically examine the data to determine whether termination of the study is warranted. 
1	Long-term follow-up of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas treated with adjuvant adoptive immunotherapy. Between August 1986 and October 1987, the Denver Brain Tumor Research Group conducted a clinical trial using autologous human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated lymphocytes to treat 20 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. The trial involved surgical resection and/or decompression followed by intracavitary implantation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and autologous stimulated lymphocytes (ASL) along with rIL-2 in a plasma clot. One month later, stimulated lymphocytes and rIL-2 were infused through a Rickham reservoir attached to a catheter directed into the tumor bed. The LAK cells were rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 4 days; the ASL were lectin- and rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 10 days. Of the 20 patients treated, 11 were evaluated as a group (mean age, 44 years, range, 15-61 years; mean Karnofsky rating, 69, range, 50-100; mean Decadron dose at entry, 14 mg/d, range, 0-32). The average number of lymphocytes implanted was 7.6 x 10(9) (range, 1.9-27.5 x 10(9], together with 1 to 4 x 10(6) U of rIL-2. To date, 10 of the 11 patients died, all from recurrent tumor growth. The median overall survival time was 63 weeks (range, 36-201; mean, 86). The median survival time after immunotherapy was 18 weeks (range, 11-151; mean, 39). No significant difference in survival after immunotherapy was found between those patients who had received previous chemotherapy and those who had not. The use of steroids or prior chemotherapy did not influence the in vitro generation of ASL or LAK cells. 
1	Basic studies on a new material for inducing antitumor immune cells. Recently, adoptive immunotherapy for cancer with lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells has been widely used experimentally. The therapy has several problems, including difficulty in handling, sterilization, and time consumption. To solve these problems, new materials able to induce antitumor immune cells were investigated. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and PWM-conjugated materials (CMC-1) could induce strong killer cells by short-term stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The induced killer cells showed a wide killing spectrum in vitro against human tumor cell lines (MKK-1, PRMI4788, NBT-2, ZR-7530, H-1, Hela, KB, HMV-1, PC-10, C-1). Human PBL stimulated for a short time by CMC-1 also showed a tumoricidal effect on tumor bearing (MKN-1, MKN-45) nude mice. These results suggest that CMC-1 may solve the problems with currently used LAK therapy and may provide easily applicable extracorporeal immunotherapy for cancer. 
5	Anaesthetic problems in ex situ resection of the liver. Ex-situ resection of the liver is a new surgical technique for treatment of liver tumours not amenable to conventional surgery. This paper describes the cardiovascular and metabolic changes that occurred in nine consecutive such patients. No severe haemodynamic or pulmonary complications occurred. Specific problems were encountered during the prolonged anhepatic period, which lasted an average of 5.96 (SD 1.46) hours. Significant metabolic and coagulation disorders occurred 2 to 3 hours after hepatectomy because of complete loss of hepatic function. The predominant findings during the anhepatic period were hypoglycaemia and severe metabolic acidosis, mainly from increased levels of lactic acid. Exogenous administration of dextrose 5% at an average rate of 188 ml/hour was necessary to maintain normoglycaemia, while correction of metabolic acidosis required 403 (SD 159.79) mmol of sodium bicarbonate, supplemented by hyperventilation. Tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane was used when sodium overload was thought to be a problem. There was a marked decrease of Factor V and fibrinogen, a moderate thrombocytopenia and fibrinolysis. The severity of these alterations was dependent on the duration of the anhepatic period and the primary function of the re-implanted liver. 
1	Obesity and body fat distribution and breast cancer prognosis. This study addresses the effect of obesity and body fat distribution on axillary lymph node involvement, tumor size, and estrogen receptor (ER) level in breast cancer patients. Anthropometric measurements were prospectively obtained on 248 consecutively and newly diagnosed women with invasive breast cancer. The anthropometric measurements evaluated were abdomen, thigh, subscapular, and midaxillary skinfolds; weight; and height. Weight and Quetelet Index (kg/m2) were significantly (P = 0.001) associated with lymph node involvement in postmenopausal patients. The abdomen:thigh skinfold ratio was significantly higher in premenopausal patients (P = 0.004) and postmenopausal (P = 0.03) without axillary node involvement compared with women with 4+ axillary node involvement. The abdomen:thigh skinfold was higher (P = 0.05) in women with smaller breast cancers (less than 2.0 cm) and higher ER levels. Weight and Quetelet Index did not affect tumor size or ER level. This study demonstrated that obese postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer tend to have more axillary node involvement than their leaner counterparts. Generalized obesity did not affect tumor size or ER level. Premenopausal and postmenopausal women with upper body fat distribution appear to be a subset of women who have a more favorable prognosis as measured by less lymph node involvement, smaller tumors, and higher levels of ER in their tumors. 
4	Adventitial red blood cells produce intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries of cats following subarachnoid hemorrhage. After dividing 21 cats into three equal groups, we exposed their right middle cerebral arteries transorbitally and adventitially irrigated them with 2 ml washed red blood cells, blood plasma, or saline. To determine arterial intimal platelet accumulation in each cat, we injected [111In]oxine-labeled platelets intravenously immediately before injecting the various experimental solutions. Animals were sacrificed 2 or 4 hours following the injection of labeled platelets. Irrigation with washed red blood cells produced a significantly greater intraluminal accumulation of platelets than irrigation with saline (p less than 0.05). Plasma tended to have less of an effect on platelet accumulation than washed red blood cells, but this difference was not significant. These data suggest that the adventitial blood fraction responsible for intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries following subarachnoid hemorrhage may be derived mainly from the red blood cell fraction. 
5	The Maylard incision in gynecologic surgery The transverse muscle-splitting Maylard incision was used in 175 gynecologic patients who required pelvic-abdominal surgery. One hundred fifty-three patients (87%) had pelvic malignancy; other indications for operation included uterine myomas, endometriosis, tuboovarian abscess, and benign ovarian cysts. Exposure was excellent: 54% of patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and 17% underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Twelve patients (6.9%) had wound complications, but there was neither long-term morbidity nor mortality associated with the incision. Fifty-six patients (32%) received preoperative or postoperative pelvic radiation therapy with no detrimental effect on wound healing. The Maylard incision is cosmetic, strong, easily learned, and has an acceptable complication rate. Unless a vertical incision is indicated, the Maylard technique is preferred when optimal exposure and accessibility to the pelvis are required. 
5	Coronary angioplasty following cardiac transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. A 23-year-old man underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery 25 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. Four months later restenosis of the same lesion was treated by repeat PTCA. Angiography 11 months later showed no restenosis. In selected cases, PTCA may be useful in treating allograft coronary disease. 
1	Ampullary hamartoma: endoscopic diagnosis and treatment. This study shows a patient who presented with intermittent biliary tract obstruction caused by ampullary hamartoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a large ulcerated papilla and dilated biliary ducts. Tissue diagnosis was established by a large particle biopsy obtained with a snare. The patient underwent a successful endoscopic sphincterotomy and has remained symptom free for 4 years. 
5	Incidence of adverse events and negligence in hospitalized patients. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study I BACKGROUND. As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care. METHODS. We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984. We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians. RESULTS. Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6). Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death. The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001). Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence. Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001). The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01). There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. There is a substantial amount of injury to patients from medical management, and many injuries are the result of substandard care. 
5	Anorectal malignant melanoma in Sweden. Report of 49 patients. Clinicopathologic features and prognosis of 49 patients with anal malignant melanoma were investigated in the total Swedish population between 1970 and 1984. Median age was 71 years (range, 50 to 87 years), and there was a female predominance (31 females, 18 males). The most common symptom at presentation was bleeding. The majority of tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm in diameter and all invaded at least into the submucosa and/or the lamina propria. At diagnosis, one third of the patients had either regional or distant metastasis with a median survival of 5 months. The remaining patients were surgically treated with curative intent, either by abdominoperineal resection (APR) or local excision. Median survival was poor in both treatment groups (APR, 12 months; local excision, 13 months). Most patients died with distant metastasis. Our results confirm the opinion that APR offers no more curative potential than a more conservative surgical approach. However, tumor sizes were on average smaller in the group treated by local excision. This could indicate that, in the absence of known distant metastasis, radical surgery should be performed, particularly since local recurrences tended to be more common after a local excision. 
5	Correction of subclavian artery stenosis by percutaneous angioplasty. Subclavian artery stenosis is an infrequently recognized cause of left-sided chest and arm pain that can mimic the signs and symptoms of angina pectoris. In addition, more proximal subclavian artery stenoses can be associated with cerebrovascular symptoms in the "subclavian steal syndrome." This article reviews the clinical experience in four patients who presented with different manifestations of subclavian artery stenosis and who were all successfully treated by percutaneous angioplasty. Their clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and post-angioplasty results are documented. In conclusion, it is felt that nonsurgical correction of critical subclavian artery stenosis, using current angioplasty techniques, is the preferred method of treatment. 
4	Amiloride blocks the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in the sheep. This study investigated the ability of two diuretics, amiloride and frusemide, to prevent the development of ACTH induced hypertension in conscious sheep. Infusion of amiloride (20 mg/day) or frusemide (50 mg/day) for three days into normotensive sheep did not have any significant effects on blood pressure. Amiloride blocked ACTH-induced hypertension and the sodium retention and hypokalemia which is usually associated with ACTH administration. Frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension and potassium loss, however it blocked the transient initial urinary sodium retention associated with ACTH-induced hypertension. As frusemide failed to completely block the hypertension it is unlikely that the amiloride effect is due primarily to effects on urinary Na excretion. It is possible that amiloride is exerting its antihypertensive effects by blocking sodium channels. 
5	Diagnostic modalities in abdominal trauma. Peritoneal lavage, ultrasonography, computed tomography scanning, and arteriography. Numerous algorithms encompassing the diagnostic studies described above have been published in recent years. For practical purposes, diagnostic peritoneal lavage and CT scanning are the diagnostic studies most commonly used in patients without obvious indications for celiotomy after blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is invasive, rapidly performed, cheap, and accurate and has a primary role in documenting intra-abdominal bleeding or contamination in hypotensive patients with blunt trauma or selected stable patients with penetrating stab wounds. It misses small and large injuries to the diaphragm and cannot rule out injury to retroperitoneal structures. Computed tomography is noninvasive, time consuming to perform, expensive, and accurate and has a primary role in defining the location and magnitude of intra-abdominal injuries in stable patients with blunt trauma or with penetrating trauma to the flank or back. In many hospitals, it misses gastrointestinal perforations or ruptures. Both studies may be needed in the same stable patient, and both should be available and used in a complementary fashion in the modern trauma center. 
1	Surgical strategy for early gastric cancer. The diagnostic and therapeutic options in early gastric cancer are reviewed. In Japan, the rate of detection of early gastric cancers has increased so that minute gastric cancers can now be identified as a result of advances in diagnostic methods. The results of histopathological staging of a large number of resected specimens have led to three surgical options based on size and depth of the primary lesion, namely classical R2 resection, radical resection with limited lymphadenectomy and endoscopic surgery. 
2	Achalasia of the cardia: long-term results of oesophagomyotomy and posterior partial fundoplication. Forty-eight patients with achalasia of the cardia were treated by Heller's myotomy with a posterior fundoplication of approximately 270 degrees, suturing the gastric fundus to the edges of the myotomy. The mean(s.d.) postoperative follow-up period was 5.4(2.8) years. The clinical results were good to excellent in 44 cases (92 per cent) and fair in four cases (8 per cent) (two with residual dysphagia and two with gastrooesophageal reflux). Barium studies showed a decrease in oesophageal diameter and disappearance of distal narrowing but normal oesophageal emptying did not occur. Postoperative manometric studies (29 patients) revealed a significant decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and a significant increase in the length of the infradiaphragmatic segment. In the oesophageal body a recovery of peristaltic waves in the proximal third was seen in ten of the patients (34 per cent). Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring showed pathological reflux in only three of 25 patients studied, and one of these was asymptomatic. This technique is effective, improving oesophageal symptoms and controlling long-term reflux. 
5	A clinicopathological study of the paraneoplastic neuromuscular syndromes associated with lung cancer. The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit. 
2	The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. 
5	Dystrophin analysis in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy carriers: correlation with intracellular calcium and albumin. Immunocytochemical localization and immunoblot analysis of dystrophin in muscle fibers of 11 obligate and probable, and 7 possible carriers of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy revealed an abnormal expression of the protein in 3 of them. Localization of calcium and albumin, as endogenous markers of extracellular fluid penetration, showed the presence of both molecules inside some fibers lacking dystrophin. Our morphological studies show that the initial stages leading to fiber necrosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are present in carriers with mosaicism. Comparison of dystrophin studies with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and creatine kinase levels showed that neither immunocytochemical nor immunoblot techniques for dystrophin are sensitive enough to provide a basis for genetic counseling. 
3	Neurologic complications of alcoholism. Neurologic and myopathic complications of alcoholism are multiple and diverse, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the ED, initial concern is for diagnosing readily reversible causes and ruling out possible life- or limb-threatening etiologies. A rapid assessment of the ABCs, a fingerstick blood glucose determination, and, in cases of AMS, the administration of intravenous naloxone is indicated. In almost every instance of a potential neurologic complication, intravenous thiamine replacement is indicated initially, along with the parenteral administration of folic acid and the other B vitamins, including nicotinic acid and pyridoxine. Metabolic screening with electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes (AST, alkaline phosphatase), bilirubin, arterial blood gases with carboxyhemoglobin determination, and a complete blood count are often warranted. Special tests such as CT scan, CK, ammonia, or toxicologic screens are indicated in specific instances. In terms of physical examination, attention to the presence of focal neurologic findings is paramount because of the possibility of a subdural or epidural hematoma. It is important not to miss meningitis and a low threshold for treatment or lumbar puncture should be maintained. Specialized consultation and referral are needed only after stabilization and appropriate tests are performed. If an organized approach to the evaluation of an alcoholic with neurologic symptoms is undertaken, occult disease will not be missed and outcomes will be improved. 
5	Pulmonary aspiration during emergency endoscopy in patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and significance of aspiration and its clinical importance in patients with upper GI bleeding undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the ICU. DESIGN: Thirty consecutive patients with active and severe upper GI bleeding were studied. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Ranged in age from 20 to 78 yr with an equal number of males and females. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and had chest radiographs obtained less than 12 hr before endoscopy and less than 4 hr after endoscopy. MEASUREMENTS: Six (20%) of 30 patients developed new lung infiltrates after esophagogastroduodenoscopy. In this group of patients, preendoscopy chest radiographs were obtained after less than 4 hr. In five of these patients, infiltrates were accompanied by fever and/or leukocytosis and oxygen desaturation to less than 90% during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant aspiration pneumonia frequently complicates esophagogastroduodenoscopy in upper GI bleeding patients and is an important mechanism of esophagogastroduodenoscopy-induced hypoxia. 
3	An objective score to predict upper tract deterioration in myelodysplasia. Bladder dysfunction in myelodysplasia may present a significant hazard to the upper tract and a threat to kidney function. Urodynamic features of high leak pressure and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia have been associated with an increased risk. We have developed an objective score to describe urodynamic findings in myelodysplasia. The score includes consideration of bladder compliance, detrusor contractility and reflux, in addition to leak pressure and sphincter behavior. In 171 myelodysplastic patients a significant correlation was demonstrated between the score and upper tract studies at the time of urodynamics and the score and the management decision. Of 73 myelodysplasia patients with normal upper tracts at the first urodynamics study hydronephrosis later developed in 14. The score was a potent predictor of outcome (p = 0.0006). 
1	Surgical therapy in Barrett's esophagus. Seventy-six patients with Barrett's esophagus were cared for during a 10-year period. Fifty-six patients (74%) presented with complications of the disease. There were 20 strictures, 7 giant ulcers, 11 cases of dysplasia, and 29 patients with carcinoma. In patients with benign disease, 93% had mechanically defective sphincters and 83% had peristaltic failure of the lower esophageal body. Esophageal pH monitoring showed excessive esophageal exposure to pH less than 4 in 93% and excessive exposure to pH more than 7 in 34% of the patients tested. Ninety-three per cent of patients with excessive alkaline exposure had complications, compared to only 44% with normal alkaline exposure (p less than 0.01). Gastric pH monitoring, serum gastrin levels, and gastric acid analysis supported a duodenal source for the alkaline exposure. Antireflux surgery was performed using Nissen fundoplication in 30, Belsey partial fundoplication in 3, and Collis-Belsey gastroplasty in 2. Six required resection with colon interposition. Good symptomatic control was achieved in 77% after antireflux surgery. Four patients had symptoms and signs of duodenogastric reflux; three required a bile diversion procedure. Fifteen patients had an en bloc curative resection with colon interposition. One patient with high-grade dysplasia on biopsy was found to have intramucosal carcinoma after simple esophagectomy. Five tumors were intramucosal, seven were intramural, and four were transmural. Lymph node involvement occurred only in the latter two. Actuarial survival 5 years after curative resection was 53%. Median survival time for patients after palliative resection or no resection was 12 months. Study of en bloc specimens indicated that extent of resection should be adapted to extent of disease: esophagectomy for intramucosal disease, en bloc esophagectomy with splenic preservation for intramural and transmural disease. Serum CEA was useful in detecting recurrent disease after surgery when the primary tumor stained positively for CEA. 
4	Effects of n-3 fatty acids in essential hypertension. We examined the effects on blood pressure, plasma lipoproteins, and platelet function when marine oil supplements (rich in n-3 fatty acids) or vegetable oil supplements (rich in n-6 fatty acids) were added to the usual diets of patients with mild essential hypertension. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients received 50 g of either marine oil (n = 8) or vegetable oil (n = 8) daily for 6 weeks following a baseline observation period. Diastolic blood pressure declined during treatment with fish oil (mean +/- SEM, 96 +/- 2 v 89 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = .02), but did not change with vegetable oil (92 +/- 1 v 94 +/- 1 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure did not change significantly during either treatment. Serum triglycerides declined (by approximately 30%) in patients receiving only marine oil, but total cholesterol, LDL-, HDL-, HDL2-, and HDL3-cholesterol-subfractions and apolipoproteins A-I and B were unchanged in both treatment groups. Bleeding time increased by 33% during treatment with marine oil but did not change with vegetable oil supplements. Marine oil did not alter in vitro platelet aggregation thresholds. The lack of a significant correlation between blood pressure changes and platelet membrane fluidity, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine, or epinephrine suggests that these variables did not mediate the antihypertensive effect of the marine oil. We conclude that large doses of marine oil reduce diastolic blood pressure, lower triglycerides, and increase bleeding time in patients with mild hypertension. 
5	Lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse in teenage twins. A case report and review of the literature. We report the cases of teenage twin girls presenting within months of each other with severe symptoms from lumbosacral disc prolapses, requiring laminectomy in one and chemonucleolysis in the other. CT scans showed similarities in spinal configuration, including the presence of disc bulges at the L4-5 level. This suggests a strong hereditary factor in prolapse of intervertebral discs, but a review of the literature showed little information on that aspect. 
5	In vitro and in vivo effects within the coronary sinus of nonarcing and arcing shocks using a new system of low-energy DC ablation. DC shocks within the coronary sinus have been abandoned because of the risk of cardiac rupture and tamponade. Catheter ablation using DC energy to electrodes straddling the ostium of the coronary sinus, when used clinically, has been reported to result in cardiac tamponade in as many as 16% of patients. A new system of energy delivery maximizes voltage while decreasing the undesirable effects caused by barotrauma. This system includes 1) a low-energy ablation power supply with a brief time-constant capacitive discharge that delivers up to 40 J and 3,000 V and 2) a low-energy ablation catheter with a contoured distal electrode. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies of this new system and compared arcing shocks with nonarcing shocks. Ablations were performed using unipolar distal shocks (D) and unipolar shocks to both electrodes made electrically common (P-D). In vitro studies were done in a large tank filled with physiological saline while recording voltage, current, and pressure. High-speed cinematography (32,000 frames/sec) of shocks of 10-40 J permitted detailed analysis of the vapor globe. Anodal shocks of less than 20 J showed no arcing or only minimal vapor globe formation. For D and P-D anodal shocks of 40 J, the diameters of the vapor globe were 31 and 22 mm, respectively, corresponding to pressure recordings of 11 and 4.9 atm. The pressure rise lasted less than 50 mu sec. In vivo studies involved 18 dogs that received nonarcing shocks (one to six shocks of 15 J) and 18 dogs that received arcing shocks (one to three shocks of 40 J). Each group was divided between D and P-D shocks; catheter ablation was performed at a mean +/- SEM distance of 2.94 +/- 0.92 cm within the coronary sinus. All dogs tolerated the procedure without cardiac rupture or tamponade. When killed 2-4 days later, the dogs had edema and hyperemia or hemorrhage in the area of the coronary sinus. We compared the effects of multiple (three to six) nonarcing shocks with the effects of one to three arcing shocks. Disruption or rupture of the coronary sinus within the epicardial fat space occurred in two of 12 dogs (17%) with multiple nonarcing shocks but in 13 of 18 dogs (72%) with arcing shocks (p less than 0.003). Occlusion of the coronary sinus occurred in two of 12 dogs (17%) with multiple nonarcing shocks and in nine of 18 dogs (50%) with arcing shocks (p less than 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Osteotomy for osteoarthritis of the hip. A survivorship analysis. We have reviewed 368 osteotomies carried out for osteoarthritis of the hip at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. Survivorship analysis showed that 10 years after osteotomy 47% had required no further surgery, and even after 20 years 23% had still not had a hip replacement. Hips with moderate arthritic change showed significantly better results than those with more severe degeneration. Osteotomies with varus angulation as well as medial displacement showed longer survival. 
5	Vitamin E in gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. To clarify the relationship among vitamin E, oxygen radicals, and lipid peroxidation in ischemia-reperfusion, we produced an experimental model of gastric mucosal injury in rats by ischemia-reperfusion with clamping of the celiac artery and measurements of the area of gastric erosion, thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances, and alpha-tocopherol in serum and gastric mucosa during ischemia-reperfusion. The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage. 
4	Transient left ventricular filling abnormalities (diastolic stunning) after acute myocardial infarction. A variety of experimental studies suggest that diastolic left ventricular (LV) function changes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but limited data exist on these changes in humans. To assess diastolic filling after AMI, 60 patients underwent Doppler echocardiographic examination within 24 hours of AMI. Of 54 patients who also underwent catheterization, 45 (83%) were successfully reperfused. A subgroup of 17 patients underwent a follow-up Doppler examination at 7 days after infarction, whereas 15 patients with stable exertional angina served as control subjects. There was no significant difference in age, gender, incidence of systemic hypertension or diabetes mellitus, heart rate, mean arterial pressure or severity of coronary artery disease between the infarct and control groups. The infarct group had a lower velocity time integral total (9.9 +/- 0.4 cm vs 12.0 +/- 0.9 cm, p less than 0.001), a lower velocity time integral E (5.8 +/- 0.3 cm vs 6.8 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.01) and a lower velocity time integral 0.333 (3.5 +/- 0.4 cm vs 6.1 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.01) than the control group. In addition, velocity time integral A/total was significantly greater in the infarction group (0.44 +/- 0.03 vs 0.35 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.01) compared to the control group. The follow-up subgroup showed an increase in velocity time integral total (p less than 0.01), velocity time integral E (p less than 0.05) and velocity time integral 0.333/total (p less than 0.05) over the first 7 days after infarction. The final recovery values at 7 days were not significantly different from those of the coronary artery disease group. 
1	Squamous carcinoma metastatic to the sternum. A 63-year-old man had a 10 x 16-cm sternal mass 18 months after a second aortocoronary bypass operation. The resected lesion was a metastatic tumor of squamous histology. No primary tumor was found. The diagnostic work-up and treatment options are presented. 
2	Nocturnal intragastric acidity during and after a period of dosing with either ranitidine or omeprazole. The magnitude and duration of changes in nocturnal intragastric acidity caused by 25 days of dosing with the antisecretory drugs ranitidine and omeprazole were investigated in a double-blind study of 22 healthy subjects. Nocturnal intragastric acidity was studied before (twice), during (on day 25), and after (every 3 days for 21 days) dosing with either 300 mg ranitidine at night or 40 mg omeprazole every morning. Three and six days after withdrawal of dosing with ranitidine, median integrated nocturnal intragastric acidity was increased significantly (17% and 14%, P = 0.01 and P = 0.05, respectively) compared with before dosing. Three days after withdrawal of dosing with omeprazole, median integrated nocturnal intragastric acidity was decreased significantly (-23%, P = 0.003). Compared with before dosing, no significant differences were seen in the ranitidine group between days 9 and 21 or the omeprazole group between days 6 and 21 after cessation of dosing. Fasting plasma gastrin concentration was measured on the morning of each study; compared with before treatment, the only significant elevations occurred on the last day of dosing with omeprazole (before, 4 pmol/L; during, 7 pmol/L). It is concluded that rebound intragastric hyperacidity after dosing with 300 mg ranitidine at night or sustained hypoacidity after dosing with 40 mg omeprazole every morning reflect transient disturbances of gastric function that are unlikely to be of clinical importance. 
2	Biliary and pancreatic metastases of breast carcinoma: is surgical palliation indicated? Obstructive jaundice developed in a patient concomitantly with the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Abdominal exploration disclosed a metastatic tumor in the head of the pancreas, the distal bile duct, and the gallbladder. A cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed and later, because of intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent gastrojejunostomy. Pathological examination demonstrated metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast with strongly positive staining for estradiol. Additional hormonal therapy has been given to the patient since the operation. The patient is alive 16 months after the diagnosis of her disease. This case suggests that a vigorous diagnostic approach should be adopted in every jaundiced patient with metastatic breast cancer in order to exclude causes of jaundice other than diffuse metastatic involvement of the liver. Patients with extrahepatic biliary metastasis should be treated by aggressive surgical treatment, combined with systemic therapy which can offer them significant palliation and better survival. 
4	Assessment of myocardial perfusion in patients after the arterial switch operation. In 21 patients who had undergone the arterial switch operation, the adequacy of myocardial perfusion was evaluated by thallium-201 computed scintigraphy 2.6 +/- 2 (0.3-7) yr after surgery. Fourteen patients had undergone the arterial switch procedure after pulmonary artery banding and seven as a primary repair. Isoproterenol stress increased the heart rate by at least 55%. Tomographic imaging was performed at peak stress and 3 hr later in the reperfusion phase. Nine patients had perfusion defects. The perfusion defects were located at the left ventricular apex in four (with extension to the inferolateral wall in one), left ventricular anterolateral wall in two, ventricular septum in one, left ventricular inferior wall in one, and right ventricular free wall in one. Some of these defects could be due to myocardial damage at the time of surgery, but these results also raise concern about long-term adequacy of myocardial perfusion following the arterial switch procedure. 
3	Sleep apnoea syndrome associated with maxillofacial abnormalities. Four cases with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) are presented. They consisted of two cases with TMJ ankylosis with micrognathia, one case with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and one case with the Long Face Syndrome. Standard and specific cephalometric parameters were obtained to detect the site of the obstruction. Polysomnographic studies yielded information regarding the patient's sleep-wake state, respiratory and cardiac functioning, pre- and post-operatively. A temporary tracheostomy corrected the symptoms in one patient but the syndrome recurred when it was closed. Surgical correction of the maxillofacial anomalies will re-establish normal sleep patterns preventing OSAS. 
3	Periventricular hyperintensity detected by magnetic resonance imaging in infancy. Twenty-one infants younger than 12 months of age were diagnosed as having periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Ten infants had experienced neonatal asphyxia, 6 intracranial hemorrhage, 2 bacterial meningitis, and 3 apnea. PVH was classified according to its extent. Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I). Continuous PVH was observed in 17 infants (PVH patterns II and III). Fourteen infants with continuous PVH had spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. Developmental delay was demonstrated in 15 infants with continuous PVH. No PVH pattern I infants had cerebral palsy; only 1 such infant had mild developmental delay. Our study suggests that the extent of PVH reflects the severity of brain damage in neonates with cerebral injuries. 
4	Restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A practical proliferative model in porcine coronary arteries. A model of proliferative human restenosis was developed in domestic pigs by using deep injury to the coronary arterial media. Metal wire coils were delivered percutaneously to the coronary arteries of 11 pigs with an oversized, high-pressure (14 atm) balloon and were left in place for times ranging from 28 to 70 days. During placement, the balloon expanded the coils and delivered them securely within the arterial lumen. Light microscopic examination of the vessels confirmed fracture of the internal elastic lamina by the coil. An extensive proliferative response occurred in 10 of the 11 pigs and was associated with a luminal area narrowing of at least 50% in all but one pig. The histopathologic features of the proliferative response were identical to those observed in human cases of restenosis after angioplasty. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the prominence of smooth muscle cells in the proliferative tissue. A similar response was obtained in two of five porcine coronary arteries in which balloon inflation only was performed, without coil implant. This model is practical and inexpensive and closely mimics the proliferative portion of human restenosis both grossly and microscopically. Thus, it may be useful for understanding human restenosis and for testing therapies aimed at preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty or other coronary interventional procedures. 
5	Detecting arrhythmia by exercise electrocardiography in pediatric patients: assessment of sensitivity and influence on clinical management. We studied 49 patients with suspected arrhythmias (group 1) and 92 patients with previously documented arrhythmias (group 2) who underwent exercise electrocardiography (EECG) at our institution between 1979 and 1987. Among group 1 patients, all of whom had sinus rhythm before exercise, 10 (20%) had abnormal findings on EECG, and treatment was modified in 4 of these 10 (8% of group 1). Further testing (24-hour ambulatory or transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring or electrophysiologic study) of the 39 patients with normal EECG findings revealed 8 additional patients with arrhythmias. In group 1, the sensitivity of EECG was 56%, and its negative predictive value was 79%. Group 2 consisted of 38 patients with atrial arrhythmias, 31 with ventricular arrhythmias, and 23 with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities before EECG. Of these 92 patients, 68 (74%) had abnormal EECG findings. All but 1 of the 24 patients with normal findings underwent further testing, and rhythm abnormalities were induced in 16. Patients with atrial arrhythmias were more likely to have normal EECG results (42%) than were those with ventricular arrhythmias (23%) or an atrioventricular conduction abnormality (4%). Of the 35 patients who had been referred for suppression of an arrhythmia, 25 (71%) had abnormal rhythm suppressed during exercise. Clinical management was modified in 27% of group 2 patients on the basis of EECG findings. 
2	Colonic lipomas: outcome of endoscopic removal. Colonic lipomas are benign adipose tumors which are usually submucosal. With the increase in the number of endoscopic procedures being performed, these tumors are often detected incidentally at colonoscopy. Although the risks of removing these tumors have been recognized, numerous reports have documented safe removal by snare electrocautery. We have reviewed the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histopathologic features of seven lipomas that were endoscopically removed over a 5-year period. Four patients recovered uneventfully, while three patients (42.8%) developed colonic perforation after the polypectomy. In the latter group, the lipomas were significantly larger than they were in the patients who did not develop colonic perforation (1.9 +/- 0.4 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 cm, respectively; p = 0.048). Furthermore, the polypectomy specimens from those patients who developed perforation all contained significant muscularis propria. Lipomatous polyps that are identified at endoscopy to be greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter and to have a limited pedicle are at the greatest risk for endoscopic perforation. 
5	Rotator cuff lesions: signal patterns at MR imaging. The signal intensity patterns of rotator cuff lesions at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were evaluated in 80 patients who had surgical correlation and in 13 asymptomatic individuals (14 shoulders). Six cadaver shoulders were examined with MR, and histologic correlation was obtained in four. All studies were performed at 1.5 T with a flexible circular surface coil. The accuracy of MR imaging in detection of full-thickness cuff tears (31 patients) was 0.95 and of partial thickness tears (16 patients), 0.84. The most common and accurate pattern for full-thickness cuff tears (22 of 31 tears) was a region of intense signal seen on T2-weighted images. Less often the torn region consisted of an extremely degenerated and attenuated tendon with moderate signal intensity or was obscured by low-signal-intensity scar. The intense signal pattern on T2-weighted images was also accurate, although a less common finding (seven of 16 cases), in the diagnosis of partial tears. Tendinitis was recognized as focal or diffuse regions of increased signal intensity or a nonhomogeneous pattern of increased signal often associated with tendinous enlargement. In some patients, manifestations of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis was present. Tendon degeneration was also manifested as regions of increased signal intensity. Some similarity and overlap of signal patterns of partial interstitial tears, tendinitis, and tendon degeneration are observed. 
3	Cerebral blood flow velocities in the anterior cerebral arteries and basilar artery in hydrocephalus before and after treatment. We studied Pourcelot's index (PI), which shows cerebral vascular resistance, in the anterior cerebral arteries and basilar artery, and the PI ratio (Pourcelot's index in the anterior cerebral artery/Pourcelot's index in the basilar artery) in 11 measurements of hydrocephalus. The mean values of PI in the anterior cerebral artery, basilar artery, and the PI ratio before treatment were significantly higher than those after treatment and those in normal infants. Before treatment, the mean PI in the anterior cerebral arteries was significantly higher than the mean PI in the basilar artery. All PI ratios increased to 1.00 or more. After treatment and in normal infants, the mean PI in the anterior cerebral arteries was significantly lower than the mean PI in the basilar artery. All PI ratios decreased to less than 1.00. We believe that the PI ratio is useful to evaluate the need or effect of treatment in hydrocephalus. 
5	Long-term results of the Belsey Mark IV antireflux operation in relation to the severity of esophagitis A retrospective analysis of the results of the Belsey Mark IV operation has been conducted, relating these to the degree of esophagitis present preoperatively. Analysis of 89 patients showed a 91.7% success rate in patients without esophagitis. Good results diminished steadily as the severity of esophagitis increased, giving 76.5%, 75%, 66.7%, and 50% success rates for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree esophagitis, respectively. We believe that shortening of the esophagus is an important factor in this. Shortening is obvious in third- and fourth-degree esophagitis but subtle in first- and second-degree esophagitis. We conclude that the Belsey operation is adequate for patients without esophagitis, but for patients with any degree of esophagitis more effective reflux control is needed. 
4	Ischemic colitis. An ever-changing spectrum? Ischemic colitis, or more properly colonic ischemia, became a clear clinical entity in the past 25 years. Yet, early diagnosis of this disease with its various presentations remains a difficult task. A 10-year review at our hospital identified 38 patients with colonic ischemia for comparison with the authors' previous experience and with data from the literature. Several important factors emerge: (1) Twice as many cases occurred after operations (34% in this series vs. 16% in the past), probably because fewer and fewer spontaneous cases were hospitalized. (2) Sixteen patients required operative intervention for colonic ischemia with a mortality of 62 per cent, while those treated nonoperatively had a mortality of 14 per cent. Seven of eight postoperative patients who required a second operative procedure for their colonic ischemia died. A high clinical suspicion is necessary in the postoperative patient, as colonic ischemia appears to be more severe among these patients. Moreover, the high incidence of associated cardiovascular disease indicates that early diagnosis, as well as monitoring of the "at-risk" patient, is needed for improvement in survival to occur. New monitoring methods, such as tonometry, may help accomplish this goal. 
5	Linear scleroderma associated with ptosis and motility disorders. A case is reported in which an 11-year-old girl developed progressive ptosis and a subsequent motility disorder of the right eye. The diagnosis linear scleroderma en coup de sabre was established. Atrophy of the upper levator palpebral and superior rectus muscle could be shown on CT scan. 
3	An estimate of the incidence of dementia in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The proportion of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) who are considered demented ranges from 10% to 15%. Because dementia may affect survival in PD, the incidence rate of dementia, rather than proportion, would be a more accurate measure of disease frequency. We previously estimated the proportion of patients with PD and dementia to be 10.9% from the records of a cohort with the idiopathic form of PD in a major medical center. We reviewed the clinical records of this cohort after 4 years and 9 months to estimate the incidence rate of dementia. We identified 65 new cases of dementia from the 249 patient-records available. Using the number of person-years of follow-up for each case as the denominator, we estimated the overall incidence rate to be 69 per 1,000 person-years of observation. The mean age of this cohort was 71.4 years. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age. By 85 years of age, over 65% of the surviving members of the cohort were demented. The age-specific incidence rates for dementia in this cohort of PD were significantly greater than for a similarly aged cohort of healthy elderly people. The age-specific standard morbidity ratios indicated that, compared with people of similar ages, patients with PD have the highest increase in risk for dementia between ages 65 and 75. 
3	Motion analysis of the cervical spine in athetoid cerebral palsy. Extension-flexion motion. Frequently instability and premature onset of spondylosis of the cervical spine are found in athetoid cerebral palsy (CP) patients. These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP. Through motion analysis, the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities. The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is "whip movement." Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects, especially at the upper cervical levels. Also, a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels, followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine. Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets. Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels. A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine, analogous to a cantilever, caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc. 
3	The relationship of headache symptoms with severity and duration of attacks. Efforts to develop clinically useful headache classification schemes have generally focused on linking specific symptom groupings with specific headache subtypes. An alternative conceptual approach, the "severity model" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache. 
1	Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. 
1	Adverse mortality experience of a southwestern American Indian community: overall death rates and underlying causes of death in Pima Indians. As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of such preventive efforts. These findings and recommendations probably apply to many Native American populations. 
1	Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. 
5	Giant sclerosing leiomyoma of bladder presenting as chronic renal failure. The clinical and pathologic features of a case of giant sclerosing leiomyoma of the bladder in a male Polynesian patient are reported. The presenting complication of chronic renal failure due to tumor envelopment of both ureters and consequent bilateral renal obstruction appears to be unique in the literature. 
4	Translumbar arch aortography: a retrospective controlled study of usefulness, technique, and safety. Subclavian and axillary artery stenoses may lead to axillofemoral bypass graft failure. These arteries were assessed preoperatively with arch aortography performed after conventional high translumbar peripheral aortography by exchanging the initial 16-gauge sheath for a 5-F pigtail catheter. Thirty-two diagnostic translumbar runoff and arch (TLR-arch) aortograms were obtained in 30 patients with advanced lower extremity ischemia. In six patients (20%), the results of the arch study influenced the choice of an inflow site. These patients were compared with 70 control subjects who underwent conventional translumbar aortography without arch studies. In the TLR-arch group, two major complications occurred in one patient, while in the control group 11 major complications occurred in 10 patients. One retroperitoneal hematoma occurred in the TLR-arch group; two occurred in the control group. The mean change in hematocrit for the TLR-arch group was -3.81% (-0.0381), and for the control group it was -4.17% (-0.0417). This difference was not statistically significant. Arch aortography is a valuable adjunct to the translumbar aortofemoral study. It can be simply performed without increasing the morbidity of the peripheral study. 
5	Antiarrhythmic efficacy of a new class III agent, UK-68,798, during chronic myocardial infarction: evaluation using three-dimensional mapping. UK-68,798 is a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent that selectively lengthens the effective refractory period (ERP) in isolated tissue without affecting conduction velocity. The present study was performed to evaluate the antiarrhythmic efficacy of UK-68,798 (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) in dogs with a previous myocardial infarction. UK-68,798 did not alter the PQ interval or QRS duration of the surface electrocardiogram but did increase the Q-Tc interval significantly. The ventricular ERP was increased significantly (P less than .01) at a basic cycle length of stimulation of either 300 ms (ERP increased 24 +/- 10 ms) or 250 ms (ERP increased 20 +/- 12 msec), indicating that the response was preserved at more rapid rates. UK-68,798 prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in six of seven animals (86%, P = .03). However, UK-68,798 failed to prevent the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in dogs where VF was the only arrhythmia induced. To evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the prevention of ventricular tachycardia and lack of efficacy against inducible VF, detailed three-dimensional activation mapping of the heart in vivo was used. Induction of ventricular tachycardia was prevented by UK-68,798 due to a lengthening of the ERP in the epicardial region surrounding the infarct with no effect on conduction velocity even in periinfarct regions bordering the infarct. In contrast, the induction of VF was dependent on a rapid nonreentrant or focal mechanism that was not altered by the lengthening of ERP with UK-68,798. Thus, UK-68,798 is a selective class III antiarrhythmic agent that is likely to be efficacious in preventing arrhythmias due to a reentrant mechanism in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. 
3	Driving and epilepsy. A review and reappraisal Driving and epilepsy is a problem that involves physicians as both care providers to patients and consultants to regulatory authorities. Driving restrictions for people with seizure disorders are intended to ensure the public's safety, but such restrictions may unduly harm the welfare of many people with seizures. In the United States, all states now permit some people with epilepsy to drive. In general, only people whose seizures are adequately controlled are licensed to drive. Adequate control has been judged principally by the seizure-free interval, but individual state standards widely vary. There is a trend toward greater liberalization of driving standards for people with seizure disorders, but the appropriateness and application of these standards continue to raise questions, as does the role physicians should have in the licensing process. Our responsibilities to persons with disabilities and advances in our understanding of seizures and the nature of driving risks warrant a reappraisal of the current medical, legal, and social implications of driving and epilepsy. 
4	Evaluation and management of supraventricular tachycardia in children. Emergency physicians may be called on to resuscitate acute complications in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Supraventricular tachycardia, with or without hemodynamic decompensation, is one of the most serious complications. We present the case of a 22-month-old boy with a history of single ventricle who presented to our institution with a history of syncope and hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia. Initial attempts at pharmacologic conversion with propranolol and verapamil failed. The arrhythmia was terminated in response to an IV fluid bolus and dopamine infusion and probably resulted from a combination of anemia, hypovolemia, and impaired contractility. Appropriate evaluation and management relating to the cre of acute supraventricular tachycardia in children are discussed. 
1	An unusual manifestation of Paget's disease of bone: spinal epidural hematoma presenting as acute cauda equina syndrome. Neurologic sequelae of Paget's disease of bone include involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to mechanical compression by enlarged vertebrae, ischemia caused by a spinal artery, steal syndrome or neoplasm. We describe a patient with Paget's disease of bone who presented with acute cauda equina syndrome due to a spinal epidural hematoma. Clinicians need to recognize this entity since surgical intervention may result in a favorable outcome. 
1	Nonspecific magnetic resonance appearance of renal oncocytomas: report of 3 cases and review of the literature. We report the magnetic resonance appearance of 3 cases of solitary renal oncocytomas. All lesions were of low to moderate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and became considerably brighter on the more heavily T2-weighted images. One lesion contained a large central area of cystic degeneration, while the other 2 were solid. A central stellate scar was present in the smaller of the 2 solid lesions. Our observations lend further support to earlier reports on the nonspecific magnetic resonance features of oncocytomas. 
5	An outpatient anticoagulation protocol managed by a vascular nurse-clinician. Lifetime anticoagulation has become a therapeutic option for surgical patients with hypercoagulable states or prosthetic arterial bypass grafts. However, physicians may not achieve optimal anticoagulation or may attempt to limit the length of the therapy period because of the perceived morbidity from hemorrhagic complications of Coumadin therapy. A protocol for anticoagulant therapy monitored and regulated by a vascular nurse-clinician was reviewed. Coumadin was prescribed for 1,891 patient-months to 93 patients to maintain their prothrombin time 1.5 to 2 times control (range: 18 to 24 seconds). The mean (+/- SD) prothrombin time for the study population was 19.8 +/- 1.8 seconds. During follow-up, 472 (14%) of 3,479 prothrombin times measured were below the therapeutic range (n = 232) or prolonged (n = 240), prompting an adjustment in the Coumadin dose in 82 (88%) patients. Four patients developed recurrent vascular graft thrombosis while receiving anticoagulation. There were 6 major and 11 minor hemorrhagic complications. Patients with a chronic risk for arterial or venous thrombosis can have out-patient anticoagulant therapy administered at optimal intensity and regulated safely with a low incidence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic events. 
5	Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. 
1	An epitope on the transferrin receptor preferentially exposed during tumor progression in human lymphoma is close to the ligand binding site. We have previously reported an anti-transferrin receptor antibody, Trump, which was originally selected for its ability to discriminate low- and high-grade lymphomas. This feature was distinct from the other anti-transferrin receptor antibodies such as OKT9. In the present study, further immunochemical analysis was performed to define the nature of the antigenic site recognized by the Trump antibody. Trump was found to block the binding of transferrin both to solubilized and to surface transferrin receptors; conversely, transferrin could block the binding of Trump only to surface transferrin receptors. Therefore, the epitope recognized by Trump is near but not identical to the transferrin binding site. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin induced both the OKT9 epitope and the Trump epitope, but 12-phorbol 13 myristate acetate induced only the OKT9 epitope. Growth of some cell lines was inhibited by Trump but not by OKT9. No structural difference was found between transferrin receptor molecules reactive with Trump and those reactive with OKT9. In support of these results, Trump was able to immunoprecipitate transferrin receptor molecules solubilized from low-grade follicular lymphoma cells even though it did not bind to the receptors exposed on the surface of these cells. These findings imply that low-grade lymphoma cells differ from high-grade lymphoma cells not in the structures of their transferrin receptors but in their exposure of the molecule on the cell surface. 
1	A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. 
5	Mechanisms of vein graft atherosclerosis: LDL metabolism and endothelial actin reorganization. We have explored the effect of arterial hemodynamics on endothelial cell morphology and low-density lipoprotein metabolism in human saphenous vein segments harvested from tissue donors. An arterial pulsatile perfusion system was used to impose physiologic pressures and flows for 20 hours on saphenous vein and companion (control) femoral artery segments. A venous perfusion apparatus was also employed for the perfusion of a second (control) saphenous vein segment for the same period of time. Calculations of fluid shearing and wall tensile stresses were performed and related to induced changes in endothelial cell geometry and cytoskeletal actin organization and the incorporation, degradation, and localization of intact low-density lipoprotein within the vessel wall. Our results indicate that, compared with native arteries and veins, a 20-hour exposure of test saphenous veins to arterial hemodynamics induced (1) a significant increase in endothelial cell luminal surface area and perimeter independent of alignment with flow, (2) disassembly of the dense peripheral band of actin with a concomitant assembly of stress fibers, and (3) a two- to fourfold elevation in the undegraded low-density lipoprotein content, localized primarily within the subendothelial intima. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these results are uncertain, the focal accumulation of intramural low-density lipoprotein may be related to the loss of normal barrier function during endothelial cell enlargement, which is accompanied by transient cytoskeletal reorganization during the adaptation to arterial flow. 
5	Increased risk of leukemia relapse with high-dose cyclosporine A after allogeneic marrow transplantation for acute leukemia. Eighty-one patients with acute myeloid leukemia (ANLL, n = 44) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 37), aged 10 to 50 years were randomized to receive 1 mg/kg per day (n = 41, group A) or 5 mg/kg per day (n = 40, group B) of cyclosporine A (CyA) from day -1 to day +20 after bone marrow transplant (BMT). All patients received CyA orally thereafter. All patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), and received unfractionated BM from an HLA-identical sibling. The two groups were comparable for diagnosis, disease status, French-American-British (FAB) classification, WBC count at diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, extramedullary disease before BMT, donor/recipient age and sex, number of cells infused, and number of days with intravenous (IV) CyA. Median follow-up for surviving patients in group A was 983 v 632 days in group B. Patients in group A had lower serum levels of CyA (295 v 686 ng/mL, P = .004), lower bilirubin levels (1.9 v 2.6 mg/dL, P = .07), lower creatinine levels (0.9 v 1.4 mg/dL, P = .06), and a lower proportion of CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood (PB) within day +21 (19% v 28%, P = .07). First day to 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils was comparable in the two groups (13 v 14 days; P = .1). In a Cox model, the actuarial risk of acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) grade II+, after stratification for age (less than 20 years greater than) was significantly lower in group B patients (0.54, P = .04). The actuarial risk of developing chronic GVHD was comparable (P = .9). Actuarial transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 240 days was 28% and 26% (P = .8) in group A and B: the major cause of death was GVHD in group A (P = .02) and multiorgan toxicity in group B (P = .07). The actuarial risk of relapse at 2 years overall was 20% in group A and 52% in group B (P = .001); it was 9% v 43%, respectively, for patients in first remission (P = .0001) and 48% v 63% for patients in non-first complete remission (CR) (P = .1). Actuarial 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) in group A and B was 58% v 32% (P = .02) for all patients, 71% v 35% (P = .01), in first remissions, and 30% v 23% (P = .2) in advanced disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients with diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study focused on 401 children less than 5 years old who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and who were investigated for the presence of both bacterial and viral respiratory tract pathogens as well as for selected diarrheal pathogens. The most common manifestations of ALRI were pneumonia (374 cases), bronchiolitis (12 cases), and tracheobronchitis (11 cases). The majority (77%) of the illnesses were in children less than 2 years of age, and 88% of the children were malnourished. A respiratory tract pathogen was identified in 30% of the patients, and a diarrheal pathogen was identified in 34%. The overall case-fatality rate in children with ALRI and diarrhea was 8%. The case-fatality rate was 14% in children with bacterial pneumonia and diarrhea, 3% in those with viral pneumonia and diarrhea, and 14% in malnourished children with shigellosis and ALRI. The most common respiratory tract pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
3	Anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer without bone graft. We followed 30 patients for more than 2 years after anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer for persistent patellofemoral pain associated with patellar articular degeneration. Twelve of these patients were followed more than 5 years. We report 93% good and excellent results subjectively and 89% good and excellent results objectively. The quality of improvement was sustained in all 12 of the patients who were evaluated again after more than 5 years from surgery. When examined separately, 75% of those patients with advanced patellar arthrosis achieved a good result; none of these patients achieved an excellent result. Postoperative continuous passive motion has markedly reduced the incidence of stiffness. Serious complications such as compartment syndrome, infection, and skin slough were avoided completely in 51 consecutive cases. Patellofemoral contact pressure studies in five cadaver knees have shown that anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer can provide substantial reduction of patellofemoral contact stress while helping to balance medial and lateral facet pressures. This surgical procedure is mechanically and clinically successful for alleviating intractable pain related to patellar malalignment and articular degeneration. This procedure enables the majority of appropriately selected patients with malalignment and patellar articular degeneration to resume increased levels of activity with substantially diminished pain. 
5	Spontaneous rupture of an aortic aneurysm into the left renal vein. A diagnostic challenge. Rupture of an aortic aneurysm into a renal vein presents a rare and difficult diagnostic problem. Often, therapy is delayed because the patient is thought to have a urologic problem. In this instance, CT scan provided useful clues leading to the diagnosis of this entity, and its rapid treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first CT scan done in a patient with aorto-renal vein fistula.
