Transesophageal Doppler echocardiography of pulmonary venous flow: a new marker of mitral regurgitation severity. Pulmonary venous flow varies with different cardiac conditions. Flow patterns in response to mitral regurgitation have not been well studied, but flows may vary enough to differentiate among different grades of regurgitation. Accordingly, pulmonary venous flow velocities were recorded in 50 consecutive patients referred for outpatient (n = 26) or intraoperative (mitral valve repair; n = 24) echocardiographic examination for mitral regurgitation. Recordings were made of right and left upper pulmonary veins with pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography. Mitral regurgitation was graded from 1+ to 4+ by an independent observer using transesophageal color flow mapping. The results of cardiac catheterization performed 5 weeks earlier in 43 of the patients were also graded for mitral regurgitation by an independent observer. Pulmonary venous flow patterns, the presence of reversed systolic flow and peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities were compared with the severity of mitral regurgitation indicated by each technique. Of the 28 patients with 4+ regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping, 26 (93%) had reversed systolic flow. The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping was 93% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by cardiac catheterization were 86% and 81%, respectively. Discordant flows were observed in 9 (24%) of 38 patients; the left vein usually showed blunted systolic flow and the right showed reversed systolic flow. In 22 intraoperative patients, there was "normalization" of pulmonary venous systolic flow after mitral valve repair in the postcardiopulmonary bypass study compared with the prebypass study after the mitral regurgitant leak was corrected. 
Excision of exposed cartilage for management of Mohs surgery defects of the ear. Cartilage of the ear is often exposed during Mohs surgical procedures. Fenestration of the cartilage with a skin punch has been recommended to stimulate granulation tissue where the perichondrium has been destroyed. This article describes an alternative method--the excision of a window through the exposed cartilage, fully exposing the perichondrium on the other side of the cartilage. This promotes the rapid healing by second intention or provides a vascular bed for immediate skin grafting. Also, aggressive excision of nonviable cartilage helps prevent chondritis or perichondritis. 
Prognostic significance of a predischarge exercise test in risk stratification after unstable angina pectoris The prognostic significance of exercise testing was compared with clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables in a prospective study of 107 patients with unstable angina discharged from the hospital on medical therapy. During a follow-up period of 12.8 +/- 1.4 months, 10 patients (9%) had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 8) or died (n = 2) and 22 (20%) were readmitted with recurrent unstable angina. The relation between 20 clinical, ECG and exercise test variables and the risk of adverse outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or recurrent unstable angina) was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis. Univariate predictors of adverse outcome included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes, T wave changes on the preexercise ECG and low maximal rate-pressure product during exercise. Independent predictors of adverse outcome in multivariate analysis included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes after admission, rest pain during hospitalization, ST depression during exercise and low maximal rate-pressure product. A predictive model constructed using the regression equation and all independent predictors stratified patients into high and low risk groups (41% and 5% risk of adverse outcome, respectively). The result of a predischarge exercise test adds independent prognostic information to clinical and ECG data in medically treated patients with unstable angina and could be used in combination with clinical and ECG data to identify patients at risk of adverse events. 
The glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway in mice homozygous for chromosomal deletions causing failure of cell type-specific inducible gene expression. Wild-type newborn mice are characterized by the ability of certain liver-specific genes encoding various enzymes and mapping on different chromosomes to respond to glucocorticoid induction. Newborn mice homozygous for deletions at and around the albino locus on chromosome 7 fail to develop this competence for hormone-inducible gene expression even through they do show normal constitutive expression of the same genes. Studies of the glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway reported here show identical expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein in deletion homozygotes and normal littermates. Furthermore, the receptor interacts normally with the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90. Elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels in newborn deletion homozygotes, most likely resulting from their stressed condition, provide an explanation for the reduced binding activities of receptors reported previously. The elimination of receptors and hormones as direct targets of the chromosomal deletion effects suggests that the failure of inducible gene expression might reside in defective competence of the affected structural genes to respond to the hormonal stimulus. 
Platelet antiaggregate activity. Calcium ions act as a second messenger to platelet agonists, with increases in intracellular calcium bringing about changes in shape, aggregation, and release reactions. Changes in platelet function have been reported previously in migraine sufferers and there is evidence that hyperaggregability occurs during a migraine attack. It was decided to assess platelet aggregation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from nicardipine-treated migraine sufferers because dihydropyridine derivatives are known to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and epinephrine-induced aggregation. Aggregation induced by 1.4 mumol/L arachidonic acid was similar in PRP from control subjects and untreated migraine sufferers, whereas 1 or 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation was lower in PRP from migraine sufferers. Treatment with 20 mg of nicardipine three times daily for 2 months significantly (p less than 0.05) increased 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation. It is concluded that nicardipine was acting either on migraine pathogenic mechanisms or directly on the platelets. 
Detection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in Hodgkin's disease by the polymerase chain reaction. The authors examined paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies from 65 cases of Hodgkin's disease for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique. Overall 40% of the cases were positive for EBV DNA; there were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of EBV positivity among the different subtypes of Hodgkin's disease. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies that employed less sensitive detection techniques and suggest that EBV either is present in pathologic tissues only in some phases of the evolution of Hodgkin's disease or is a pathogenetic factor involved in only a portion of cases. 
A comparison of the KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy vs. traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy. This study compared tonsillectomy by potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP/532) laser with tonsillectomy by traditional dissection and snare. Eighty-three consecutive patients who were candidates for a tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a prospective study. The four treatments were bilateral traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy, bilateral KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy, left laser tonsillectomy and right dissection/snare tonsillectomy, and left dissection/snare tonsillectomy and right laser tonsillectomy. Intraoperative comparisons were made between the two methods with regard to blood loss and operating time. Postoperatively bleeding and healing time were also recorded. A questionnaire answered on a daily basis assessed the patient's pain. Disadvantages of the KTP/532 tonsillectomy included increased cost, increased total operating time as a result of increased setup time and laser malfunctions, delayed healing, and no statistically significant improvement in level of pain. The sole advantage associated with the KTP/532 laser tonsillectomy was decreased blood loss, which may be significant for patients with a coagulopathy. 
Dipyridamole thallium scanning in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in elective abdominal aortic surgery. Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease. 
Adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. 
Human fetal hepatocytes respond to inflammatory mediators and excrete bile. Under strict observation of the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki Human Research Committee, primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared from second-trimester fetal liver specimens. We have shown for the first time that fetal hepatocytes have the capacity to produce an acute-phase response on treatment with inflammatory mediators. Addition of interleukin-6 to the cultures resulted in strong induction of C-reactive protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin expression, whereas albumin expression was repressed. In contrast to interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta did not induce C-reactive protein expression. However, as in adult hepatocytes, fetal cells responded to transforming growth factor-beta by reduced albumin synthesis. We were able to show by virtue of fluorescein excretion into sealed clefts that fetal hepatocytes have the functional capacity to form bile. Our findings indicate that second-trimester hepatocytes can be regarded as fairly mature liver cells. 
Aminoglycoside toxicity--a survey of retinal specialists. Implications for ocular use. Surveyed members of the Retina, Macula, and Vitreous Societies reported 93 cases of macular infarction they believed to be related to administration of gentamicin sulfate; five, to administration of amikacin sulfate; and three, to administration of tobramycin sulfate. Most cases of infarction after administration of gentamicin occurred in eyes that received an intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg after vitrectomy, but a surprisingly high number, 17, occurred after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg, doses that are considered safe by many ophthalmologists. Four additional cases of infarction occurred in eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg. Four of the five cases related to administration of amikacin occurred after intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg, and one of these four occurred in an eye that did not undergo vitrectomy. Twenty-three cases of macular infarction occurred in eyes that were treated with prophylactic subconjunctival injections of aminoglycosides after routine ocular surgery. Responses from this survey suggest that aminoglycoside-induced retinal infarction is widely recognized and more common than indicated from the small number of cases reported in the literature. The role of aminoglycosides in the prophylaxis of ocular infections and the management of endophthalmitis should be reevaluated. 
Cerebrovascular regulation and neonatal brain injury. Neuropathology occurring as a result of hemodynamic injury occurs in up to 25% of preterm newborns of less than 1,500 gm birth weight and in a much smaller, but nonetheless meaningful, proportion of more mature infants. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular regulation have been proposed as major contributing factors to both ischemic and hemorrhagic injuries in the newborn brain. In this review we explore several factors that play a role in cerebrovascular regulation in the immature brain and relate them to what is known about vascular regulation in the mature brain and to the types of pathology that occur in the newborn brain. One goal in this "decade of the brain" should be to increase our basic and clinical knowledge about the cerebrovasculature of the newborn in order to enhance our ability to predict and prevent perinatal brain injury. 
Emergency intubation for paralysis of the uncooperative trauma patient. The impact of paralysis followed by intubation was studied in patients who had been traumatized and subsequently admitted to Lehigh Valley Hospital Center. Trauma admission records between January 1987 and June 1988 were reviewed. Fifty-seven patients, intubated for control of agitation and combativeness, were divided into high injury severity (HIS) and low injury severity (LIS) subgroups using admission trauma (TS) and injury severity scores (ISS). Thirty-eight (70%) were classified as HIS and 19 (30%) as LIS. All HIS patients had significant injuries diagnosed following paralysis with intubation (PWI). Mortality in the HIS group was 9%. The LIS subgroup was compared to a randomly selected group of similarly injured blunt trauma patients who did not require PWI. There were significant differences (P less than 0.05) in age, hospital cost, hours per day of nursing care, and percent of patients with an ETOH level greater than 100 mg%. Emergency paralysis with intubation is an effective method for controlling the uncooperative, combative, seriously injured patient. However, patients with low injury severity who require restraint have higher costs and require more care if they are paralyzed and intubated than if they are not. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders. Ultrasonographic examination is being used with progressively greater frequency as an aid in diagnosis of gynecologic disorders but too often without consideration of whether information other than that obtained from clinical examination is needed and whether ultrasonography can supply it. The size, number, and position of pelvic masses and, in some instances, the type of tumor can be identified, but it is not often necessary when operation is clearly indicated. Ultrasonographic screening for diseases of the reproductive organs has been proposed, but its use for this purpose is limited and it is not cost-effective. It should be used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis, not as a primary diagnostic procedure. 
Molecular genetic considerations in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is consistent with a model by which tumorigenesis results if both alleles at the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RBI) are altered. Additional genetic evidence strongly suggests that another obligate event in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is the homozygous alteration of another gene, p53. Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function. 
Risk factors for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States and association with hepatitis C virus infection. The Centers for Disease Control conducted intensive surveillance for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in four sentinel counties over a 7-year period. Testing for antibody to hepatitis C virus was performed with the newly developed enzyme immunoassay. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis remained relatively stable (average, 7.1 cases per 100,000, but there were significant changes in disease transmission patterns. The proportion of patients with a history of blood transfusion declined from 17% to 6%, but the proportion with a history of parenteral drug use increased from 21% to 42%. The proportion of patients with histories of sexual exposure (6%), household exposure (3%), occupational exposure to blood (2%), or hemodialysis (0.6%) did not change over time. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was found in 45% of patients within 6 weeks of onset of illness and in 68% of patients followed up for at least 6 months. Patients with no history of transfusions were just as likely to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus as patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, indicating that hepatitis C virus is the major causative agent of all non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States. 
Update on functional anatomy and pathology of human eustachian tube related to otitis media with effusion. New anatomic and histopathologic information regarding the eustachian tube and its surrounding structure as well as possible mechanisms of opening and closing function and dysfunction are discussed in this article. In the past two decades, much light has been shed on the relationship between anomalies of the eustachian tube and the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion. Now that a technique for obtaining specimens for any histopathologic study that includes the temporal bone as well as the eustachian tube is available, it is hoped that, by harvesting and examining a large number of such specimens, more information will be gained about the relation between eustachian tube pathology and eustachian tube dysfunction, particularly as it relates to otitis media effusion. Only in this way can the clinical management of otitis media be improved. 
Nucleolar organizer regions in vascular and neoplastic cells of human gliomas. The number of nucleolar organizer regions in vascular cells and neoplastic cells of human gliomas was counted by a combined staining technique: one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated argyrophilic protein (AgNOR) and periodic acid-Schiff staining for basement membrane of vascular components. The number of AgNORs (mean +/- SD) in the vascular and neoplastic cells of various tumors tested was as follows: benign astrocytoma (Grade 2, n = 4), 1.52 +/- 0.07 and 1.80 +/- 0.13, respectively; anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade 3, n = 7), 1.98 +/- 0.23 and 2.87 +/- 0.50; and glioblastoma multiforme (Grade 4, n = 11), 2.05 +/- 0.29 and 3.13 +/- 1.13. AgNOR scores in vascular cells of benign astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of vascular cells in normal brain tissue without neoplastic alteration (1.26 +/- 0.05; n = 3; P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the AgNOR scores of vascular cells in high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4) were significantly higher than those in low-grade gliomas (Grade 2) (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that the proliferative activity of both vascular and neoplastic cells in gliomas increased as histological malignancy advanced, and that the quantification of AgNORs was useful in evaluating proliferative activity in vascular cells as well as in assessing the malignancy of neoplastic tissues. 
Immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis. Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls. 
Acquired progressive lymphangioma. Acquired progressive lymphangioma is rare and can histologically mimic well-differentiated angioendothelioma. In a 9-year-old boy with acquired progressive lymphangioma, we demonstrated that the neoplasm consists of at least a vascular component and a smooth muscle component. The presence of type IV collagen around many vascular channels suggests that an intermediate stage of differentiation between blood vessels and lymphatics may be present. Our findings indicate that acquired progressive lymphangioma is most likely a complex hamartoma composed of vascular channels and smooth muscle. 
Brachial plexus anesthesia in pediatric patients. Between 1980 and 1988 at our institution, brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) was used in 109 pediatric patients who underwent 142 surgical procedures on an upper extremity, including 134 axillary blocks. Most patients older than 6 years of age had their blocks and surgical procedures with moderate sedation. The success rate was high--92.4% of axillary blocks and 100% of other blocks were adequate for surgical intervention in patients who required only intravenous sedation. The postoperative course in the BPA group was compared with that in 109 age-matched control subjects who underwent 188 procedures on an upper extremity during general anesthesia (GA). Admission to the recovery room after anesthesia occurred less frequently in the BPA group than in the GA group (27.5% versus 91.0%; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the BPA group than in the GA group (P less than 0.01). Outpatients in the BPA group were less likely to require narcotic analgesics before dismissal than were those in the GA group (12% versus 31%; P less than 0.05). Admission of outpatients was infrequent in both groups (2% for BPA and 9% for GA). No significant difference was noted in 24-hour postoperative narcotic requirements between the BPA and GA groups. 
Massive evisceration: a complication following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. This report describes a spontaneous vaginal vault prolapse in association with massive evisceration following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. Careful attention to surgical technique is critical to the success of the operation. In particular, good apposition of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament and adequate repair of an enterocele should avoid this complication. 
Hip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. 
Benefit of a stroke unit: a randomized controlled trial. In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards. 
Cost and quality trade-offs in the treatment of hypertension. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension is positively related to the level of pretreatment blood pressure and to the level of success in achieving patient adherence to prescribed medical regimens. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment include limiting treatment to patients with well-documented sustained increases in blood pressure, giving higher priority to the treatment of patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and above, and relying on lower-cost medications if clinical responses to treatment permit. In patients with mild hypertension, a comparison of strategies for initiating pharmacological treatment that takes into account potential side effects as well as the costs of medications indicates a difference of $270/patient-yr between the least and most expensive alternatives. Whether the additional costs of more expensive treatment strategies are "worth it" depend on any additional health benefits actually conferred. Moreover, higher-cost strategies may have negative influences on patients' decisions to adhere to prescribed regimens or to continue in treatment. Cost is a particular problem for the treatment of chronic conditions like hypertension because of inadequate insurance coverage for medications, especially for the poor. 
Acupuncture in angina pectoris: does acupuncture have a specific effect? To overcome the methodological problems of blinding the patients and the acupuncturist in acupuncture trials, 33 patients with stable angina pectoris, who were randomized to either genuine or sham acupuncture, received electroacupuncture by another acupuncturist, and the change in skin temperature was recorded. It was found that the change in skin temperature correlated significantly with the degree of improvement following both genuine and sham acupuncture. Fourteen patients with no decrease in skin temperature exhibited a significantly better response to acupuncture than 19 patients who showed a decrease in skin temperature (G II). In the former group, there was a 15% median improvement in exercise tolerance (G II 0%), a 67% improvement in anginal attack rate (G II 38%), and an 84% improvement in nitroglycerine consumption (G II 50%). A significant correlation was found between the duration of disease and the effect of acupuncture. It is concluded that both genuine and sham acupuncture have a specific effect on some angina pectoris patients in addition to the effect of pharmacological therapy. 
Nasal positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Difficult and time-consuming procedure for nurses. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are well-established techniques in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure; however, there are situations in which these procedures cannot be used safely for various reasons. A recently described noninvasive technique, nasal positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), has been developed for home ventilation of certain patients with chronic ventilatory insufficiency. We hypothesized that NPPV could be used in selected patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation were clearly indicated, but not immediately possible, or even contraindicated. Six patients were treated with NPPV during an episode of acute respiratory failure and enrolled in a prospective study. We found that NPPV was successful in avoiding intubation, but only in the three patients suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disorder, whereas the procedure was unsuccessful in patients with obstructive disorders. Moreover, in every patient, acute NPPV was very time-consuming for the nursing staff: in patients with restrictive disorders, a nurse had to monitor a patient submitted to NPPV during 41 +/- 9 percent of the duration of ventilation and during 91 +/- 9 percent of the NPPV time in patients with obstructive disorders. We conclude that acute NPPV may be attempted in selected patients with acute respiratory failure, predominantly patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, but that this procedure is very time-consuming for nurses. 
Emergency esophagogastrectomy for treatment of hydrochloric acid injury. Eight patients with severe hydrochloric acid injury of the esophagus and stomach had early esophagogastrectomy. Four patients survived and 6 to 8 weeks later underwent successful substernal colon replacement. The value of early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive surgical management of patients who have ingested hydrochloric acid is stressed. 
Treatment of refractory chronic Lyme arthritis with arthroscopic synovectomy. Of 20 patients who underwent arthroscopic synovectomy for refractory chronic Lyme arthritis of the knee, 16 (80%) had resolution of joint inflammation during the first month after surgery or soon thereafter, and they have remained well during the 3-8-year followup period. Three of these 16 patients who were more disabled preoperatively, still had mild functional limitation at long-term followup. The remaining 4 patients (20%) had persistent or recurrent synovitis. We conclude that arthroscopic synovectomy is effective in treating chronic Lyme arthritis in patients in whom the disease does not respond to antibiotic therapy. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography with graded compression was performed in 525 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis. 
Lactose intolerance. Pinpointing the source of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose intolerance is a common condition that can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. A reliable diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of the patient's history. The breath hydrogen test is simple, noninvasive, accurate, and inexpensive and is the diagnostic method of choice. In addition to traditional dietary restriction of lactose, treatment may consist of alterations in dietary fat content or caloric density to reduce symptoms and use of dairy products or additives that provide lactase activity. 
Comparison of speech perception abilities in deaf children with hearing aids or cochlear implants. The speech perception abilities of deaf children with a single- or multi-channel cochlear implant are compared with those of deaf children who derive substantial benefit from conventional hearing aids. The children with hearing aids have unaided pure-tone thresholds ranging from 90- to 110-dB HL through at least 2000 Hz, and aided thresholds of 30- to 60-dB HL. The group data show that the speech perception scores of the subjects with hearing aids were significantly higher than those of the subjects with implants on a range of speech perception measures. Although a few subjects with implants achieved scores as high as those who used hearing aids, the majority did not. Even though the children with implants receive substantial benefit from their devices, they continue to have limited auditory perception abilities relative to their peers who derive benefit from conventional hearing aids. The data highlight the importance of establishing hearing aid benefit in potential candidates for implant. 
Intermittent ischemia potentiates intestinal reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67 antigen, and human papillomavirus DNA in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the relationship between the sex steroid receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) status and the cell proliferation kinetics during the menstrual cycle in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix, immunohistochemical localization of ER, PR, and cell proliferation-associated antigen, Ki-67, was investigated in 35 normal cervical specimens, 3 condylomas, 26 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples, and 22 invasive squamous carcinoma samples. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied. In the normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER positive, PR negative, and Ki-67 negative throughout the menstrual cycle. Parabasal cells were ER positive and PR negative in the follicular phase, but ER negative and PR positive, and Ki-67 positive in the luteal phase, and Ki-67-positive cells increased in number in the luteal phase. In contrast, PR positivity was observed in the cells of condyloma (2 of 2 cases), CIN (19 of 26 cases), and invasive squamous carcinoma (13 of 22 cases) irrespective of the menstrual phase. Moreover, most neoplastic cells containing HPV DNA type 16/18 were ER negative, whereas several lesions containing HPV DNA type 31/33/35 were weakly ER positive. Many Ki-67-labeled cells were observed in the neoplastic lesions. These results suggest that reduced ER expression and increased PR expression are associated with the proliferation of normal cervical squamous epithelium, and this proliferation-related receptor status, which is probably induced by HPV infection, is usually expressed in neoplastic cervical squamous cells. 
Maintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers. Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively). In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers. Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment. 
Primary cardiac sarcomas. In marked contrast to benign cardiac tumors, primary cardiac sarcomas occur infrequently. Moreover, there is no uniform approach to treating such patients, and the benefits of postoperative chemotherapy are unclear. Between 1964 and 1989, 21 patients with primary cardiac sarcomas underwent surgical resection alone (n = 7), chemotherapy alone (n = 1), or combined operation and postoperative chemotherapy based on adriamycin (n = 13). Twenty-four operations were performed on 20 patients with relief of symptoms in all. Eleven patients had complete resection. Operative mortality was 8.3% (2/24). Histology and originating chamber(s) included angiosarcoma (n = 7; 6/7 in right atrium, 1 in left atrium), malignant fibrous histocytoma (7; all in left atrium), fibrosarcoma (2; 2/2 in left atrium), rhabdomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in right ventricle), leiomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in left ventricle); and one undifferentiated sarcoma (right atrium). Overall actuarial survival was 14% at 24 months after resection. Patients with complete resection had a median survival of 24 months compared with only 10 months in all other patients (p = 0.035). Postoperative chemotherapy did not enhance survival in patients with incomplete resection. At this time, aggressive and complete surgical resection seems to offer the best hope for palliation and survival in an otherwise fatal disease. 
Decreased serum growth hormone-binding protein in patients with liver cirrhosis. The recently characterized GH-binding protein (GH-BP) has an amino acid sequence identical to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Serum GH-BP reflects the amount of GH receptors, and the liver seems to be their main source. To evaluate the effect of liver disease on GH-BP, 52 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied. Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation. Levels of GH-BP were correlated against the clinical state, assessed by Pugh's score. The GH-BP of 31 Pugh's class A patients was 9.7 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum, and that of 21 Pugh's class B and C patients was 7.2 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum compared to 11.3 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum in age-matched controls. GH-BP correlated negatively with Pugh's score and serum bilirubin, and positively with serum albumin. It did not correlate with serum liver enzymes or serum insulin-like growth factor-I. Scatchard analysis of GH binding to the GH-BP revealed similar binding affinities in Pugh's A, B, and C patients and controls. The binding capacity in cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in controls. We conclude that serum GH-BP is controlled mainly by the liver and can provide an additional measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis. 
Teaching intubation skills using newly deceased infants. This prospective study was designed to (1) test the hypothesis that the majority of families of newly dead infants in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit would consent to their infants' being intubated for teaching purposes, (2) determine factors related to family consent, and (3) determine the effects of participation on resident physicians and respiratory therapists. Family consent for intubation was requested following 44 (80%) of the 55 deaths that occurred during the 10-month study period. Of these requests, 32 (73%) were granted. Proportionately more white than black families consented and consent was positively related to autopsy permission. Fifty-three (75%) of 71 trainees completed a mailed questionnaire after their first intubation experience. Although each respondent found the experience helpful, many reported mixed feelings categorized as doubt about participating, apprehension and discomfort, respect for the body, appreciation for the opportunity, a sense of achievement, and feelings of comfort knowing that consent had been obtained. These findings confirm our initial hypothesis and suggest that (1) newly dead infants can be a valuable resource for teaching intubation skills, and (2) others considering a similar approach need to be aware of and sensitive to trainees' feelings. 
Reflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. 
Blood warming: current applications and techniques. Active blood warming is a recent practice and arises out of conflicting needs. On the one hand, the safety and preservation of blood require refrigerated storage and delivery up to the moment of transfusion. On the other hand, modern methods of very rapid transfusion in resuscitation would cause clinically dangerous hypothermia if unmodified, ice-cold blood were to be so transfused. These needs must be reconciled in the interest of adequate patient care--hence the need for blood warming. Nevertheless, blood warming creates risks of its own and should not be used without justifying clinical indications. Within limits that extend somewhat above normal body temperature, the application of heat does no harm to stored RBC, a fact that is not reflected in current standards for blood warmers. Bearing in mind the human tendency to "stretch" standards and the fallibility of mechanical devices, caution is always wise. But perhaps the time has come for reconsideration of the present upper limit of 38 degrees C. Many varieties of blood warmers are available in the US, but none at this time is based on electromagnetic activity. The most common systems now in use are in-line warmers, most of which are not adequate for the type of rapid-transfusion systems currently available. Countercurrent in-line blood warmers and the method of rapid warm saline admixture can both be used successfully for rapid, massive transfusions. Blood warming is seldom necessary or desirable for elective transfusions at conventional rates, even for patients with cold autoagglutinins. 
Echinococcus granulosus cysts in the liver: management with percutaneous drainage. Twenty-one hepatic Echinococcus granulosus cysts (maximal diameter, 7.5 cm +/- 4.0) in 12 patients were aspirated and irrigated with hypertonic (20%) saline under sonographic guidance. All patients had signs and symptoms of a hepatic mass caused by the cysts, which had a prominent fluid component that appeared anechoic or hypoechoic, with marked enhancement of back wall echoes. The amounts of cyst fluid aspirated and of hypertonic saline used were 190 mL +/- 240 and 120 mL +/- 90, respectively. Separation of the endocyst from the pericyst and nonviability of scoleces were observed in all cysts. Mean hospital stay was 4.0 days +/- 3.4. Serial sonographic examinations revealed high-level echoes in the cyst cavity (heterogeneous echo pattern), which ultimately became uniformly echogenic (pseudotumor). After follow-up of 14.0 months +/- 5.5, maximal cyst diameter decreased to 4.1 cm +/- 3.1 (P less than .001). One patient died of unrelated causes; the remaining 11 patients experienced relief of symptoms and a decrease in liver span. 
Reduction of canine myocardial infarct size by a diffusible reactive oxygen metabolite scavenger. Efficacy of dimethylthiourea given at the onset of reperfusion. A number of scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites reduce myocardial injury when given before ischemia and reperfusion, but few, if any, have proven to be effective when given near the onset of reperfusion. This is particularly true when infarct size is measured after at least 48 hours of reperfusion, when the full extent of myocardial damage has become apparent. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU) is an extremely diffusible, potent scavenger of hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid, with a long half-life of 43 hours. Sixteen chloralose-anesthetized dogs underwent 90 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 48 hours of reperfusion. Collateral flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. Infarct size and risk area were measured by a postmortem dual-perfusion technique using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and Evan's blue dye. In eight dogs, therapy with DMTU (500 mg/kg i.v.) was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. In eight control dogs, the same volume of 0.9% saline was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia through the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size as a percent of risk area was reduced in the DMTU-treated group compared with the saline-treated controls (DMTU = 42 +/- 4% versus saline = 59 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01). 
Mucosal IgA recognition of Helicobacter pylori 120 kDa protein, peptic ulceration, and gastric pathology. The gastric IgA response to Helicobacter pylori was examined in 100 dyspeptic patients by means of immunoblotting of supernatants from antral biopsy and gastric mononuclear cell cultures. 76 of 78 patients with chronic gastritis, 2 of 8 with reactive gastritis, and 1 of 14 subjects with normal mucosa showed positive responses. Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori. 
Surgical cure of cardiac arrhythmia. 1969. The first surgical procedure undertaken for the intended purpose of curing a patient with recurrent tachycardia was performed by Sealy in 1968, and the report of that operation was published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery in 1969. The first attempted accessory bundle ablation was successful, marked the beginning of cardiac arrhythmia surgery, and has set the standard against which other methods of arrhythmia control must be measured. 
Traumatic esophageal rupture: unusual cause of acute mediastinal widening. We have presented the case of a 32-year-old man who sustained blunt trauma to the chest in a motor vehicle accident. Plain roentgenograms showed a widened mediastinum and pneumomediastinum, and an esophagogram with water-soluble contrast material showed an esophageal laceration at the T-4 level. 
Prognostic factors in invasive bladder carcinoma in a prospective trial of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed in 40 patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma treated in a prospective bladder-preserving program consisting of transurethral tumor resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine [MCV]), and 4,000 cGy radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin. Patients with biopsy-proven complete response after chemotherapy and 4,000 cGy radiation received full-dose radiotherapy (6,480 cGy) with cisplatin. Cystectomy was recommended to patients with residual disease. Distant metastasis rate was associated with tumor stage and size: 0% in T2 patients, 39% in T3-4 patients (P = .035), 6% for tumors less than 5 cm, and 59% for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm (P = .002). Risk of bladder tumor recurrence was higher in patients with tumor-associated carcinoma in situ (CIS; 40%) than those without CIS (6%; P = .075). Papillary tumors and solid tumors both had similar treatment outcomes. By multivariate analysis, tumor stage T2 (P = .04) and absence of CIS (P = .03) were significant predictors of complete response; CIS was predictive of local bladder recurrence (P = .07); and tumor size (P = .03), response after chemoradiotherapy (P = .02), and vascular invasion (P = .08) were associated with distant metastasis. Six of eight local bladder tumor recurrences were superficial tumors. The low actuarial distant metastasis rate of T2 patients (0% at 3 years), the 3-year actuarial overall survival rates for T2 (89%) and T3-4 (50%) patients, and the similar treatment outcomes for papillary versus solid tumors are encouraging when compared with published historical controls. These results provide preliminary evidence (median follow-up, 30 months) that the current chemoradiotherapy regimen may have beneficial effects in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. The true efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains to be proven by ongoing randomized trials. 
Anaesthetic-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A four-year-old deaf girl with a history of convulsions developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during induction of anaesthesia. The arrhythmia reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. Post-anaesthetic ECG showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval (570-690 msec). Deafness and prolonged QTc interval in association with microcytic-hypochromic anaemia confirmed the diagnosis of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. This case report highlights the potentially lethal complication of halothane anaesthesia in patients with long QTc interval syndrome. 
N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, a class of antiinflammatory agents with a different mechanism of action [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2612] Several members of a series of N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were found to possess a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory activity. The compounds were active against oxazolone dermatitis in mice and adjuvant arthritis in rats, models in which activated T lymphocytes are implicated. The compounds also inhibited T-lymphocyte activation in vitro, assessed by using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The compounds inhibited the reversed passive Arthus reaction in rats and arachidonic acid-induced dermatitis in mice, models in which leukocyte infiltration is responsible for the inflammatory reaction. More complete evaluation was made of one compound, N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)leucine (NPC 15199). On histologic examination after arachidonic acid administration, NPC 15199 was found to block recruitment of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. The compound was not a general myelotoxin. Prolonged treatment of animals did not alter bone-marrow progenitor number or the numbers of circulating white blood cells. Further, several white cell functions were not inhibited in vitro, including neutrophil respiratory burst and macrophage phagocytosis. NPC 15199 was effective in blocking antigen arthritis in rabbits and was effective in a therapeutic protocol, reversing oxazolone edema. These studies suggest that N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids may be valuable therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases. 
10 year review of invasive aspergillosis detected at necropsy. Between 1980 and 1989, 32 cases of invasive aspergillosis were identified out of 2315 consecutive necropsies, an incidence of 1.4%. The incidence in immunosuppressed "high risk" patients was 10.7%. Twenty out of 32 cases showed spread beyond the lungs, with the brain the most common site. There was an increase in cases in the second half of the decade, attributable to the start of a liver transplantation programme. Liver transplant recipients and patients with haematological malignancies were at significantly greater risk of acquiring aspergillosis than kidney transplant recipients or those with solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy. There was also a greater risk of haematogenous dissemination in liver transplant recipients than in all other groups, and this was significantly associated with the use of high dose steroids as anti-rejection treatment. Aspergillus was isolated during life in only eight cases, which indicates a continuing need for and emphasises the value of necropsy. 
Antibodies to cytoplasmic sequences of cloned liver growth hormone (GH) receptors recognize GH receptors associated with tyrosine kinase activity. GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of GH receptors in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, and highly purified GH receptor preparations exhibit tyrosine kinase activity. Paradoxically, however, the GH receptor cloned from liver exhibits no sequence similarity to receptors with known signal transduction mechanisms, including those exhibiting ligand-activated tyrosine kinase activity. These observations raise the possibility that there are two kinds of receptors for GH: the first represented by the cloned liver GH receptor, and the second by a tyrosine kinase-containing GH receptor. To inquire into the possibility of two distinct GH receptors, we determined whether the cloned liver GH receptor shares structural similarities with the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. When the cloned rabbit liver GH receptor is expressed in human kidney 293 cells, it migrates with a mol wt appropriate for the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, despite the calculated mol wt of the cloned GH receptor being 60,000 smaller than that of the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. The recognition of tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor by antipeptide antibodies to three different epitopes on the cytoplasmic domain of the cloned liver GH receptor was also tested. Tyrosyl phosphorylated [125I]human GH-receptor complexes were prepared by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody; this subpopulation of GH-receptor complexes was recognized by all three antipeptide antibodies. The antibodies also recognized similarly isolated tyrosyl phosphorylated GH-receptor complexes, which had been further phosphorylated in solution on tyrosyl residues upon addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. Furthermore, highly purified GH receptors prepared by sequential immunoprecipitation using phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody and any one of the three antipeptide antibodies incorporated 32P into tyrosyl residues upon the addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. These results provide evidence that tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptors share sequence similarity in the cytoplasmic domain with the cloned liver GH receptor. The cloned GH receptor and the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, therefore, are likely to be the same receptor or related receptor isoforms. 
Malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. 
An analysis of sequential physiologic changes in hypoxic cor pulmonale during long-term oxygen therapy. Physiologic changes were studied retrospectively in 37 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale who died during long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The subjects were assessed during periods of clinical stability for each year on LTOT. At the onset of treatment, their mean age (+/- SEM) was 60.0 +/- 1.3 years, and at the time of death, they were aged 65.0 +/- 1.3 years. The median duration of LTOT was five years. For each year leading up to death, mean values of FEV1, PaO2, and PaCO2 were obtained. A rate of decline of FEV1 of 73 +/- 10 ml/yr was observed, and this was accompanied by a decline in PaO2 of 0.47 +/- 0.01 kPa/yr. Patients died with a mean FEV1 of 0.55 +/- 0.04 L and a PaO2 of 5.1 +/- 0.2 kPa. A small rise in PaCO2 occurred, on average 0.25 +/- 0.09 kPa/yr, throughout the study, but accelerating in many cases during the three years before death. Hypoxic cor pulmonale appears to be associated with a rapid deterioration in airway function, a steady decline in PaO2, and a slow rise in PaCO2 during the years leading up to death. These physiologic changes measured in a stable clinical state while breathing air appear to occur in spite of LTOT. The LTOT may merely prevent death from episodes of severe hypoxemia while the pathophysiologic changes in the lung progress. Hence the benefit to be expected from LTOT is only temporary. Generally, those patients with lower levels of FEV1 will obtain diminishing clinical benefit, inversely related to the severity of airflow obstruction at the time of commencement of LTOT. 
Non-infective verrucous endocarditis in a patient with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old women with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome, who developed a haemodynamically significant non-infective verrucous endocarditis is reported. Her mother suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. A pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in heart valve lesions is suggested. 
Homozygous prion protein genotype predisposes to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [published erratum appears in Nature 1991 Aug 8;352(6335):547] The human prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS), are neurodegenerative diseases that are unique in being both infectious and genetic. Transmission of both diseases and the animal spongiform encephalopathies (for example, scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) to experimental animals by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates is well documented. Despite their experimental transmissibility, missense and insertional mutations in the prion protein gene are associated with both GSS and familial CJD, demonstrating that the human familial cases are autosomal dominant diseases. More than 80% of CJD cases occur sporadically, however, and are not known to be associated with mutations. Here we report that 21 of 22 sporadic CJD cases and a further 19 of 23 suspected sporadic CJD cases are homozygous at the polymorphic amino-acid residue 129; 51% of the normal population are heterozygous at this site. We argue that homozygosity predisposes towards sporadic CJD and that this directly supports the hypothesis that interaction between prion protein molecules underlies the disease process. 
Radiation therapy for primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system. An analysis of 63 cases. From 1976 to 1988, 63 patients received radiation therapy for primary cancers of the extrahepatic biliary system (eight gallbladder and 55 extrahepatic biliary duct). Twelve patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients. Three patients underwent intraluminal brachytherapy alone (range, 28 to 55 Gy). Sixty patients received megavoltage external-beam radiation therapy (range, 5.4 to 61.6 Gy; median, 45 Gy), of whom nine received additional intraluminal brachytherapy (range, 14 to 45 Gy; median, 30 Gy). The median survival of all patients was 7 months. Sixty patients died, all within 39 months of radiation therapy. One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival. 
Correlation of the antiproliferative effect and the Mx-homologous protein induction by IFN in patients with malignant melanoma. The human interferon-induced intracellular protein homologous to the murine Mx-protein has recently been identified by means of a specific monoclonal antibody. Three of six melanoma cell lines elicited this intracellular human Mx-homolog upon incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, yet all six melanoma cell lines tested were susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. Compared per antiviral unit, IFN-gamma had weaker Mx-inducing but stronger antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha. These data suggest that the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein is not involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN on malignant melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, 51 patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated thrice weekly with 10 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2b and 6 x 10(6) nIFN-alpha, respectively. Nine of the 51 patients experienced systemic objective tumor responses (3 complete response, 6 partial response), but had Mx concentrations in their mononuclear cells equal to the Mx levels of non-responders during IFN-alpha therapy. Therefore, the level of Mx-homologous protein induced during IFN therapy is not a predictive marker for an antitumor response in malignant melanoma. 
A preliminary report of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus triple antibiotic therapy in children with ruptured appendicitis. Standard therapy for childhood ruptured appendicitis includes combination antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Complicated dosing schedules and the possibility of aminoglycoside toxicity make alternatives desirable. One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium). This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children. The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein. While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy. Also discussed are the relative merits of immediate versus delayed primary closure of the abdominal wound after appendectomy. 
Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is a rare condition with several features of concern to the anaesthetist. The patients are of extremely short stature and the presence of kyphoscoliosis may lead to significant respiratory impairment. Cervical vertebral body changes can result in spinal cord compression and laryngotracheal stenosis may be present. The management of such a patient presenting for elective Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia is described. 
Peripheral odontogenic fibroma: a clinicopathologic study. The clinicopathologic features of 30 cases of peripheral odontogenic fibroma are reviewed. The age distribution is wide (11 to 76 years), and there is a slight predilection for males. The majority of the lesions (93%) occurred in blacks on the attached gingiva, and with equal frequency in the maxilla and mandible. Size varied between 1 and 3 cm in diameter. One case recurred after 14 months. Histologically, the lesions are nonencapsulated and poorly delineated. The amount of odontogenic epithelium varies considerably and consists usually of small islands or strands, although larger follicles are sometimes present. In one case the epithelial cells had a clear cytoplasm, whereas in another it was granular and eosinophilic. Origin from the surface oral mucosa can sometimes be seen. The connective tissue component is usually cellular, but collagenous, myxomatous, and mixed forms occur. Calcifications were present in 22 cases and consisted of tissue interpreted as either dentinoid, cementum, bone, or dystrophic calcific material. 
Early constrictive pericarditis and anemia after Dressler's syndrome and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Early constrictive pericarditis and anaemia developed in a 52 year old man after he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by Dressler's syndrome. Total pericardiectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms. 
Spontaneous hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with hereditary hepatitis. A model of Wilson's disease. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an inbred strain of a mutant rat isolated from Long-Evans rats, develop hereditary hepatitis. To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans. 
Dietary fiber and bowel function in tube-fed patients. In tube-fed patients, dietary fiber is often used to manage constipation/diarrhea. Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined. 
Interrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Efficient management of adrenal tumors. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 121 patients with primary adrenal tumors operated on at 2 Vancouver hospitals between the years 1970 and 1990. The purpose of the study was to identify discriminating factors between the various diagnoses in order to minimize both the time and the cost of the investigative process. There were 57 cortical adenomas, 35 pheochromocytomas, 15 carcinomas, 8 cases of cortical hyperplasia, and 6 miscellaneous tumors. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis of those patients presenting with an identifiable syndrome was 48.3 months. Those with a hypertensive syndrome presented significantly later than those with Cushing's syndrome (57.7 months versus 22.8 months, p less than 0.01). There was a significant delay in diagnosis in those patients with hypertension on the basis of an aldosteronoma as compared with those with hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma (75.4 months versus 36.1 months, p = 0.02). Cortical carcinomas were significantly larger than benign cortical tumors (12.7 cm versus 5.5 cm). No malignant neoplasm measured less than 5 cm in diameter. Diagnostic sensitivity for intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was 59%, for ultrasound 71%, for venography 50%, for meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) (pheochromocytoma only) 80%, and for angiography 70%. However, for those patients with adrenal carcinomas, angiography was positive in 100% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive localizing investigation with a sensitivity of 98%. While other localizing techniques were less sensitive than CT, they may still play a useful role in selected situations. Factors causing delay in diagnosis and the role of the various imaging modalities are discussed. 
Epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS). With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively. Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments. 
Safety of alcohol after viral hepatitis. To test the validity of the generally held belief that moderate consumption of alcohol during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis adversely affects outcome, 87 adults recovering from acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis A in 36, hepatitis B in 34, hepatitis non-A, non-B in 17) were studied. Criteria for entry to the study attempted to ensure that no patient was a chronic hepatitis B carrier. Patients were randomised either to a moderate alcohol intake, or to continued complete abstention. Drinkers consumed 26 g alcohol daily (mean) and none remained abstinent. At 3 months all patients were well, with normal liver function tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups at anytime. The findings suggest that moderate alcohol intake during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis does not seem to be harmful. 
Involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, thought by some to be associated with tumor formation of retinoblastoma as a recessive human oncogene, was investigated in 57 cases using DNA and RNA from primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors. 
Identification of alloimmunized patients: use of radiolabeled allogeneic platelet kinetic measurements and platelet antibody tests. In a group of stable, nonthrombocytopenic leukemia patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation, results of paired allogeneic radiolabeled platelet kinetic measurements were correlated with the results of several different platelet and lymphocytotoxic antibody tests to determine which parameters could be used to identify patients who were alloimmunized to platelets. Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets. 
Comparison of IgG antibody profiles by immunoblotting in patients with acute and previous Toxoplasma gondii infection. The IgG antibody profile to Toxoplasma gondii proteins of less than 37 kilodaltons in sera from patients with acute and previous infection was studied by immunoblotting. Bands at 28, 29, and 36 kilodaltons were more common in acute infection (10 out of 10, nine out of 10, and nine out of 10, respectively) compared with previous infection (five out of 10, four out of 10, and one out of 10, respectively). The 6 kilodalton band was present in 10 out of 10 sera from patients with acute infection and five out of 10 sera from those with previous infection. A new observation is a doublet of bands of 22-25 kilodaltons present only in sera from patients with acute infection. This doublet may be a more reliable indicator of acute infection than the 6 kilodalton band. 
Effect of enteral nutrition on exocrine pancreatic function. Twelve patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy in which the pylorus was preserved. The effects of parenteral and enteral nutrition on pancreatic secretion were compared. Postoperative nutrition was administered by needle-catheter jejunostomy in seven patients and by total parenteral nutrition in five patients. Pancreatic juice, drained directly from the pancreatic duct, was collected in 4-hour fractions. Volume, bicarbonate, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin were measured. In the first two postoperative days, there was a slow increase in all measured indices. On the third postoperative day, an abrupt rise occurred, after which pancreatic secretion stabilized. No differences in exocrine pancreatic secretion were observed between the enteral and parenteral methods of feeding. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. 
Endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through operation. A new approach to cancers of the esophagus and proximal stomach. Many thoracic surgeons have expressed concern about the complications inherent in transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy. The technique of endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through uses a mucosal coring of normal esophagus beyond the tumor and leaves a muscular tube through which the substitute organ is passed. Mediastinal hemorrhage, tracheal injury, and chylothorax are eliminated. 
Effect of anticoagulant on biocompatibility in membrane plasmapheresis. The effect of heparin or citrate anticoagulation on blood cellular, complement pathway and coagulation pathway was investigated in a membrane plasma exchange procedure. Two membrane plasma separators constructed of cellulose di-acetate (CA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were evaluated with heparin or citrate alone for anticoagulation in a 26 year old male with myasthenia gravis. Maximum white blood cell counts decrease was 21% at 30 min for the CA with heparin while no decrease was observed for the other schemes. Platelet counts changes were comparable between heparin and citrate, while the PVC groups showed less changes than the CA groups. The CA groups, regardless of the type of anticoagulant used, indicated that complement activation occurred via the classical pathway within the module in addition to the activation via alternative pathway for the CA with heparin. In the PVC groups, complement activation was noted to occur only when heparin was used for anticoagulation. PT and PTT showed slight increases with citrate, while they were remarkably prolonged with heparin. Citrate showed less changes in cellular and humoral factors compared to heparin. CA with heparin was the most activating combination of membrane material and anticoagulant, while the PVC with citrate was the least activating combination. 
An innovative method for neuraxis radiotherapy using partial transmission block technique. Whole CNS (neuraxis) radiotherapy is an important part of therapy for certain CNS tumours which seed via the CSF. Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and without prolonging the overall treatment time. Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates. 
Surgical anatomy of the sacrum. A guide for rational screw fixation. Anterior sacral anatomy was studied to allow safe sacral screw placement. The study included 27 bony sacra. Intrapelvic dissections were performed. Cadaveric specimens were dissected and photographed. The position and angulation of the first sacral foramen was extremely variable. After the position of the L5 root, sacral roots, and iliac vessels, was considered, safe posterior sacral screw implantation could be assured through placement above the level of the first sacral foramen directed medially toward the promontory, parallel to the superior sacral end-plate. Complications of indiscriminate screw placement included L5-root damage, iliac vein penetration, and intractable perineal pain due to sacral root injury. Preoperative computed tomography with the scanner gantry tilted to parallel the superior sacral end-plate defined the great vessels, neural foramens, inclination of the superior sacral end-plate, and prominence of the posterior ileum. Surgical accuracy was evaluated after surgery with computed tomography. 
Facial resurfacing in xeroderma pigmentosum with monoblock full-thickness skin graft. A case of xeroderma pigmentosum with multiple skin tumors on the face that was treated with total excision and replacement of face skin except the eyelids with a monoblock full-thickness abdominal skin graft is reported. The quality and tumor-free features of the monoblock full-thickness skin graft in xeroderma pigmentosum are indicated. Despite the increased morbidity of the donor region, the radical surgical approach advocated here has improved the prognosis in the case reported. 
Comparison of dexamethasone and ondansetron in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial was done to compare the efficacy and safety of a serotonin receptor antagonist--ondansetron--and dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis and nausea induced by moderately emetogenic non-platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
Increased postoperative pain and consumption of analgesics following acupuncture. Acupuncture was given to patients before (preoperative-acupuncture group, PRE-ACU, n = 25) or after (postoperative-acupuncture group, POST-ACU, n = 25) operative removal of impacted mandibular third molars. Sixty patients did not receive acupuncture and participated as a control group (CG). All patients completed a questionnaire in order to characterize state tension and stress, degrees of neuroticism, extroversion, depression and psychosomatic disorders. We also recorded intraoperative discomfort and pain intensity, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics for 72 h. The PRE-ACU was significantly more tense following surgery and found the operative procedure more unpleasant than the other two groups. The PRE-ACU further rated intraoperative pain intensity higher than the CG and experienced higher pain intensity immediately postoperatively compared with POST-ACU and CG. Of the PRE-ACU patients 15/24 needed additional local anesthesia intraoperatively while none in the POST-ACU or CG requested extra lidocaine. Postoperatively patients in both PRE- and POST-ACU reported a higher total sum of pain scores (pain intensity) and the PRE-ACU consumed more analgesics compared with the CG. A significantly larger number of patients suffering from "dry socket" (a complication during wound healing) was found in both PRE- and POST-ACU compared with the CG. No correlation was found between assessed personality characteristics and reported postoperative pain/consumption of analgesics in any group and could thus not explain the observed differences between the groups. The reason for our unexpected "negative" findings is unclear but some hypothetical explanations are discussed. 
Reduced D2 dopamine and muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities in caudate specimens from fluctuating parkinsonian patients. Binding of spiperone and 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), both labeled with hydrogen 3 (3H), were measured in caudate tissue obtained from 8 living parkinsonian patients at the time of cerebral transplantation. This was clinically homogeneous group of patients. All remained predominantly responsive to levodopa, although with marked disability secondary to clinical fluctuations (short-duration responses) and medication-induced dyskinesias; all were receiving substantial doses of levodopa and 6 of the 8 patients were additionally receiving bromocriptine or pergolide. Binding densities of dopamine D2 receptors, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, were reduced in this group of patients, compared to caudate specimens from autopsy control subjects. This findings may reflect medication-induced receptor downregulation. Parallel changes occurred with muscarinic cholinergic receptors; [3H]QNB binding was significantly reduced, compared to autopsy control values. This reduction of muscarinic receptors might be due to loss of nigrostriatal terminals that are known to contain muscarinic receptors. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors may have been downregulated by increased corticostriatal glutamatergic input to cholinergic cells, inferred to be present based on the prominent levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Finally, receptor deficits could have been a reflection of more widespread degenerative cerebral disease, although levodopa-refractory symptoms were generally not pronounced in these patients. 
Familial Ebstein's anomaly: a report of six cases in two generations associated with mild skeletal abnormalities. In a family of 11 persons in three generations six had Ebstein's anomaly. Five of the six showed mild skeletal anomalies--that is, restricted finger extension, with or without limitation of larger joints, and externally rotated little toes. Two other members of the family had the skeletal features without Ebstein's anomaly. The findings suggest a dominantly inherited syndrome of Ebstein's anomaly and skeletal abnormalities. The four female patients were all mildly affected whereas three of the four male patients were severely affected. 
Excimer laser-assisted femoral angioplasty: early results. The ability to ablate atheroma without generating heat makes the excimer laser wavelength a promising intraluminal technique for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease. This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months). 
The transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. 
Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm eroding into the interventricular septum. We report a case of erosion of an aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva into the interventricular septum. The mode of presentation, the preoperative evaluation, and the echocardiographic and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging features are presented, and the cardiac catheterization findings and surgical management of this very rare cardiac pathology are discussed. 
Some perspectives on peptic ulcer. In this article, the author comments on the following topics: whether peptic ulcer is a disease or just the sign of another process; whether the crater has a multifactorial origin; the ubiquity of Helicobacter pylori and the conclusion that a specific strain will doubtless prove to be the cause of some, but not all, ulcers; the inherent definitional problem of "nonulcer dyspepsia"; and the controversy over how much gastric acid needs to be reduced to speed the healing of peptic ulcer. 
Overlapping loss of heterozygosity by mitotic recombination on mouse chromosome 7F1-ter in skin carcinogenesis. A significant role for mouse chromosome 7 abnormalities during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis has been advanced based on previous cytogenetic and molecular studies. To determine the frequency of allelic losses at different loci of chromosome 7 in skin tumors induced in the outbred SENCAR mouse stock by a two-stage initiation-promotion protocol, we compared the constitutional and tumor genotypes of premalignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity at different informative loci. In a previous study, these tumors had been analyzed for their allelic composition at the Harvey ras-1 (Ha-ras-1) locus and it was found that 39% of squamous cell carcinomas had lost the normal Ha-ras-1 allele exhibiting 3 or 2 copies of the mutated counterpart or gene amplification. In the present study, by combining Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism analyses, we detected complete loss of heterozygosity at the beta-globin (Hbb) locus, distal to Ha-ras-1, in 15 of 20 (75%) skin carcinomas. In addition, 5 of 5 informative cases attained homozygosity at the int-2 locus, 27 centimorgans distal to Hbb. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA extracted from papillomas devoid of stromal contamination by fluorescence-activated sorting of single cell dispersions immunolabeled with anti-keratin 13 antibody revealed loss of heterozygosity at the Hbb locus, demonstrating that this event occurs during premalignant stages of tumor development. Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity was only detected in late-stage lesions exhibiting a high degree of dysplasia and areas of microinvasion. Analysis of allelic ratios by densitometric scanning of tumors that had become homozygous at Hbb but retained heterozygosis at Ha-ras-1 indicated mitotic recombination as the mechanism underlying loss of heterozygosity on mouse chromosome 7 during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. These findings are consistent with the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene linked to the Hbb locus in the 7F1-ter region of mouse chromosome 7, the functional inactivation of which may constitute a critical event in skin tumor progression, possibly during the malignant conversion stage. 
Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia. However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival. 
Effects of hypoxaemia and bradycardia on neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Near infrared spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of bradycardia and hypoxia on the cerebral circulation in the premature neonate. The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury. 
Role of combination drug therapy with a class IC antiarrhythmic agent and mexiletine for ventricular tachycardia. The combination of mexiletine and a class IC antiarrhythmic agent (encainide, propafenone or flecainide) was evaluated by electrophysiologic testing in 14 patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia whose tachycardia remained inducible during therapy with the class IC drug alone. During the control drug-free state, all patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia, with a mean cycle length of 260 ms (range 190 to 400). During monotherapy with the IC agent the tachycardia remained inducible in each patient, but there was a significant increase in the cycle length to 340 ms (240 to 500) (p less than 0.001). The effective refractory period of the ventricle was not altered. Treatment with mexiletine (oral in 13 and intravenous in 1) was begun and electrophysiologic testing was repeated. Ventricular tachycardia in one patient was rendered noninducible and one patient had arrhythmia aggravation. The tachycardia in the remaining 12 patients remained inducible but its average cycle length increased further to 392 ms (340 to 460) (p = NS). Nine patients had rate slowing and the average cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia in this group was significantly increased (302 to 388 ms, p less than 0.05). The average effective refractory period was significantly increased during combination therapy (267 ms) compared with no drug therapy (235 ms) and therapy with the class IC drug alone (247 ms) (p less than 0.05). After a mean follow-up interval of 22 months, seven patients continue on the combined treatment and have no ventricular tachycardia. 
Congestive heart failure in diabetes with hypertension may be due to uncoupling of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-effector system in the kidney basolateral membrane. Hypertension is known to potentiate the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in diabetic individuals. Receptor-effector systems for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), were studied in the kidney during hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Animals were divided into four groups: control, diabetic (D), hypertensive (H), and diabetic plus hypertensive (D + H). Diabetes was induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) injection and hypertension was induced by abdominal aortic constriction; studies were done at 1 and 6 weeks. Plasma ANP was increased at 1 week in the D, H, and D + H groups. There was a significant increase in the activity of Ca2+ + magnesium (Mg2+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which acts as a Ca2+ pump, in the kidney basolateral membrane from D, H, and D + H group at the 1 week study. Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, on the other hand, was significantly decreased in the D + H group only at 6 weeks. This was associated with a decrease in plasma ANP, an increase in the kidney ANP receptor number, and a decrease in guanylate cyclase activity. The response of the Ca2+ pump to ANP was also attenuated. Since ANP is known to mediate its cellular effects in part by increasing Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, the observed changes in the D + H group may contribute to the development of nephropathy and CHF. 
Gastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies. Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach. They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal "lipomata" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma. 
Acute abdomen as the first presentation of pseudomembranous colitis. Acute abdomen was the presenting manifestation of pseudomembranous colitis in six men who had previously been treated with antibiotics and presented with abdominal distention, pain, fever, and leukocytosis with absent or mild diarrhea. Plain abdominal radiographs revealed megacolon in two, combined small and large bowel dilation in three, with one of them showing volvuluslike pattern, and isolated small bowel ileus in one. Emergency colonoscopy was performed successfully in all patients and revealed pseudomembranes in five and nonspecific colitis in one. All patients had positive latex test results for Clostridium difficile, and two tested positive for cytotoxicity. All patients were treated with IV metronidazole, resulting in resolution of symptoms and abdominal findings. In addition, two patients underwent colonoscopic decompression with improvement. Endoscopically, complete resolution of the pseudomembranes occurred at 4 weeks in all cases. No patient had a recurrence. It is concluded that (a) pseudomembranous colitis may present as abdominal distention mimicking small bowel ileus. Ogilvie's syndrome, volvulus, or ischemia; (b) in such cases, emergency colonoscopy is safe and useful for diagnosis and therapeutic decompression and may obviate the need for surgery; and (c) treatment with IV metronidazole is effective. Colitis due to C. difficile should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in patients previously treated with antibiotics. 
Endoscopic assessment of mucosal hemodynamic changes in a canine model of gastric ulcer. In studying the side effects of sclerosants injected into the gastric submucosa in dogs (N = 7), we noted that 3 ml of absolute ethanol induced a large gastric ulceration. We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer. 
Lateral pharyngeal space abscess as a consequence of regional anesthesia. Trismus may be a complication from local anesthesia. Patients with trismus of unknown cause after dental treatment should be evaluated thoroughly. The dentist should perform a complete examination and establish a differential diagnosis to avoid missing a serious or life-threatening infection. A right lateral pharyngeal space infection developed after a general restorative procedure that involved an inferior alveolar nerve injection on the same side. The patient's severe trismus required awake intubation, incision and drainage while the patient was under general anesthesia, treatment with antibiotics and ten days of hospitalization. 
Interdependence of blood pressure and heart period regulation in mild hypertension. Blood pressure and heart period variability have been measured directly in 142 subjects with mild hypertension over 24 h. The variabilities have been expressed as the standard deviation of 2 min averages of all beats over 24 h. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed in 102 subjects by the phenylephrine method. Blood pressure varies over a range of approximately 40% around the mean by day and by approximately 20% at night. The variability of blood pressure by day was inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the baroreflex (r = -0.33, P less than .001), while the variability of heart period was directly related to the sensitivity of the reflex (r = 0.27, P less than .01). Neither of these relationships was significant at night. An inverse relationship between heart period and blood pressure was shown by regression analysis of blood pressure and heart period averages over 24 h. The steepness of the slope of the heart period-systolic blood pressure relationship was strongly correlated with the baroreflex sensitivity (r = -0.55, P less than .001), suggesting that blood pressure variations are substantially buffered by changes in heart frequency. Thus, a more stable heart rate that results from an ineffective baroreflex is associated with a more variable systolic blood pressure. 
Bleeding after endoscopic sphincterotomy as an underestimated entity. Hemorrhage is the most frequent complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9 per cent. Previous reports have generally defined this complication clinically, leaving the issue of occult bleeding after sphincterotomy essentially unaddressed. Seventy-five serial sphincterotomies were reviewed to further assess this complication. Nine patients had clinically evident hemorrhage and 27 patients had occult bleeding manifested only by a decrement in hematologic parameters, for a total postsphincterotomy bleeding rate of 48 per cent. No statistically significant risk factors for bleeding were delineated. Endoscopically recognized bleeding at the time of the sphincterotomy was 47 per cent sensitive and 85 per cent specific in predicting postprocedural bleeding. Significant delayed hemorrhage was manifest in three patients, one of whom had clinically occult bleeding. We conclude that bleeding complicates endoscopic sphincterotomy much more frequently than previously reported, although often in a clinically occult manner. Significant delayed bleeding can occur, and may not be clinically apparent. Bleeding recognized endoscopically at the time of sphincterotomy is an insensitive but relatively specific predictor of postprocedural bleeding. As use of endoscopic sphincterotomy increases, careful surveillance for hemorrhagic complications, as well as efforts to identify factors predisposing to the same, will be of increasing importance. 
Correlation between sexual abuse and somatization in women with somatic and nonsomatic chronic pelvic pain. After a comprehensive clinical and psychological evaluation, 99 women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months' duration and normal findings at laparoscopy were divided into two groups, including 47 women with probable somatic causes of pain (group 1) and 52 women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2). Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain. 
Cardiovascular neural regulation explored in the frequency domain. A consistent link appears to exist between predominance of vagal or sympathetic activity and predominance of HF or LF oscillations, respectively: RR variability contains both of these rhythms, and their relative powers appear to subserve a reciprocal relation like that commonly found in sympathovagal balance. In this respect, it is our opinion that rhythms and neural components always interact, just like flexor and extensor tones or excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular reflexes, and that it is misleading to separately consider vagal and sympathetic modulations of heart rate. In humans and experimental animals, functional states likely to be accompanied by an increased sympathetic activity are characterized by a shift of the LF-HF balance in favor of the LF component; the opposite occurs during presumed increases in vagal activity. In addition, LF oscillation evaluated from SAP variability appears to be a convenient marker of the sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. Although based on indirect markers, the exploration in the frequency domain of cardiovascular neural regulation might disclose a unitary vision hard to reach through the assemblage of more specific but fragmented pieces of information. 
Pancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. 
Direct sequencing from touch preparations of human carcinomas: analysis of p53 mutations in breast carcinomas A new technique for characterizing somatic mutations in very small samples of cellularly heterogeneous human cancer tissue was developed and tested using mutations in the p53 gene in breast carcinomas as a model system. The technique combines touch preparation of specimens to obtain homogeneous clusters of carcinoma cells free of normal cells with a nested pair of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of DNA to increase the amount of target gene sequence sufficiently to permit direct sequencing of the p53 gene. Touch preparations of fresh or previously frozen tissue from human adenocarcinomas derived from several organs were stained, and clusters of 10-50 malignant cells were transferred by pipette into microfuge tubes for PCR amplification. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, which contain the major mutational hot spots associated with most human cancers, were sequenced by the following steps: 1) two rounds of PCR amplification using DNA Taq polymerase and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, the second set being nested within the segment amplified by the first set and having attached T7 and SP6 phage promoter sequences, 2) transcription of the amplified DNA sequences with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and 3) dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded RNA transcripts with reverse transcriptase and with additional oligonucleotide primers to achieve specificity for this unique region of the genome. The utility of this approach is illustrated by our success in detecting and analyzing point mutations in cell clusters from four of 11 primary adenocarcinomas of the human breast. 
Changing pattern of bone and joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus: study of cases of bacteremia in Denmark, 1959-1988. Of the 15,170 cases of bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus that occurred in Denmark between 1959 and 1988, we review 525 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and 185 cases of septic arthritis that developed subsequent to the bacteremia and 134 cases of contiguous osteomyelitis in which the bacteremia developed secondarily. The pattern of acute infections of bones and joints has changed over the three decades studied. The frequency of secondary bone or joint infections due to S. aureus bacteremia has changed, as have the phage-type pattern and antibiotic resistance of the infective strains. The prevalence of hospital-acquired cases has increased and the age distribution of patients has changed, as is reflected in an increasing number of older patients. The localization of hematogenous osteomyelitis has shifted, and the vertebral column is now the most common site of infection. The rate of chronic cases of osteomyelitis that occur following acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has been reduced from 34% to 6%. The mortality associated with S. aureus bacteremic infections of bones or joints is low compared to that associated with other cases of S. aureus bacteremia. 
Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease. 
Hormone replacement therapy in general practice: a survey of doctors in the MRC's general practice research framework. OBJECTIVES--To survey current prescribing practice for hormone replacement therapy among general practitioners and to elicit their views on the role of hormone replacement therapy in the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease; to determine whether they would participate in randomised controlled trials to evaluate the long term beneficial and adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy. DESIGN--Postal questionnaires to general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS--1268 general practitioners in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. RESULTS--1081 (85%) doctors in 220 (95%) practices responded. The doctors were currently prescribing hormone replacement therapy to an estimated 9% of their female patients aged 40 to 64, and 55% of doctors were prescribing opposed hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen plus progestogen) to more patients than a year previously. Over half the doctors would consider prescribing hormone replacement therapy for prevention of osteoporosis (670, 62%) and cardiovascular disease (611, 57%) to asymptomatic women. Overall, 79% of the doctors (851) would definitely or probably consider entering women who have had a hysterectomy into a randomised controlled trial comparing unopposed (oestrogen only) hormone replacement therapy with opposed hormone replacement therapy; 49% (524) would enter patients with a uterus into such a trial. Among a subsample, 85% (180/210) would consider entering patients without menopausal symptoms into a trial comparing hormone replacement therapy with no treatment (unopposed in patients who have had a hysterectomy, opposed in those with a uterus). CONCLUSION--There is considerable uncertainty among general practitioners as to the balance of beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in the long term, particularly relating to its use for prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Most of these doctors would be prepared to participate in randomised controlled trials to determine the long term effects of this increasingly widely used treatment. 
Coronary patency, infarct size and left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: results from the tissue plasminogen activator: Toronto (TPAT) placebo-controlled trial. TPAT Study Group Infarct size, left ventricular function and infarct-related coronary artery patency were examined in 108 patients who took part in a previously reported placebo-controlled trial of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed 17 +/- 0.8 h after initiation of treatment in 47 patients (group A) or at 10 days in 61 patients (group B). Both groups underwent radionuclide ventriculography 3.8 +/- 0.8 h and again on day 9 after treatment and quantitative thallium scintigraphy on day 8. In group A, the infarct-related artery was patent in 53%; these patients had a smaller global (15.1 +/- 2.5% vs. 25.7 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.029) and regional (14.7 +/- 2.5% vs. 24.1 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.044) fixed thallium defect than did those with an occluded artery. Infarct regional ejection fraction improved by 10.1 +/- 2.1% between early and late studies when the infarct-related artery was patent and by 4.8 +/- 1.4% if it was occluded (p = 0.048); changes in global and noninfarct regional ejection fraction were similar irrespective of perfusion status. Infarct regional ejection fraction and fixed thallium defect were inversely related only when the infarct-related artery was occluded (r = -0.83, p less than 0.0001). In group B, 10 day patency of the infarct-related artery was 67%; there was no difference in patency by treatment assignment or in left ventricular function or infarct size between patients with and without infarct-related artery patency. There was no evidence of an effect of rt-PA therapy beyond that expressed through coronary patency alone in either group A or group B. 
CT and pathologic predictive features of residual mass histologic findings after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors: can residual malignancy or teratoma be excluded? Forty-eight patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumors were studied retrospectively to determine whether initial pathologic features and pre- and post-chemotherapy computed tomographic (CT) features could be used to exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual masses that were excised after chemotherapy. Neither CT findings (residual mass size, attenuation, and degree of shrinkage during chemotherapy) nor type of primary testicular tumor cell was significantly correlated with malignancy or teratoma versus necrosis in residual masses. No significant correlation was demonstrated between the combined features of (a) the absence of teratoma in a histologic specimen of the primary testicular tumor and (b) greater than 90% shrinkage of masses during chemotherapy and the absence of malignancy or teratoma in residual masses as suggested in the literature. Of nine patients with both of these findings, two had malignancy and two had teratoma. Radiographic and pathologic features cannot be used to reliably exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual abdominal masses after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous testicular cancer. 
Primary soft tissue tumours of the pelvis causing referred pain in the leg. Referred pain in the leg is occasionally due to a pelvic soft tissue tumour. Among 11 patients who presented this way, one had a lymphoma, one had a benign schwannoma, and nine had soft tissue sarcomas. Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg. 
Prevalence and prognostic significance of silent and symptomatic ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized population. The prevalence and prognostic significance of postoperative myocardial ischemia, as detected by exercise testing, were prospectively assessed in 174 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized surgical population who had exercise testing before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas the prevalence of symptomatic ischemia significantly decreased postoperatively (52% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001), the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia did not change (30% vs. 29%). Survival at 12 years after bypass surgery based on the 6-month postoperative exercise test results was significantly better for the 112 patients with no ischemia (80%) than for the 51 patients with silent ischemia (68%) or the 11 patients with symptomatic ischemia (45%). These data show that coronary artery bypass graft surgery diminishes the overall prevalence of symptomatic but not silent ischemia and that both silent and symptomatic ischemia adversely affect the postoperative prognosis of these patients. 
Genetic predisposition to iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been transmitted to man via administration of growth hormone and gonadotropin extracted from large pooled batches of human cadaveric pituitary glands. In the UK, 1908 individuals were exposed to potentially contaminated growth hormone, of whom 6 have so far manifested CJD. Examination of the prion protein genes of all these cases and of a single case of gonadotropin-related CJD showed that 4 had the uncommon valine 129 homozygous genotype indicating genetic susceptibility to prion infection. Such genetic susceptibility may be important in the aetiology of sporadic CJD disease. 
The mast cell in health and disease. The presence of mast cells, often in an activated state or increased numbers, has been noted in various cutaneous disorders. Recent studies suggest that mast cells are of primary importance in these conditions and their presence does not merely represent a secondary event. This review focuses on atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity reactions, bullous pemphigoid, fibrosing conditions, neurofibromatosis, wound healing, polycythemia vera, and psoriasis, in which there is significant evidence to indicate a pathophysiologic role for mast cells. 
Evaluation of restenosis after balloon dilatation in adult aortic stenosis by repeat catheterization. To evaluate the restenosis rate after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, clinical evaluation and repeat catheterization were performed in 96 patients who had undergone balloon dilatation 7 +/- 5 months earlier. Restenosis, defined as a loss of greater than 50% of the benefit in aortic valve area obtained after balloon valvuloplasty, was observed in 48% of the patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery. 
Metabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. 
A method for estimating catechol estrogen metabolism from excretion of noncatechol estrogens. The relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease has seldom been investigated because of analytic difficulties. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are oxidized simultaneously at either ring A or ring D, and the rate of catechol estrogen formation (r2) is reciprocally related to the rate of 16 alpha-hydroxylation (r3). The rate of ovarian estrogen production (X10) can be summarized as to metabolic outcome: X10 = r10 + r2 + r3 + r(u), where r10 is the loss of E1 and E2 in urine, and ru is the fecal and urinary loss of unknown oxidative products. Assuming a constant r(u) between subjects: constancy of the X10 concentration between subjects during similar menstrual cycle phases. In the absence of xenobiotics, r2 x r3 are reciprocally interrelated: r2 x r3 = K (an oxidation constant whose limiting factor is the biologically available estrogen at the cell surface). To the extent that r10 approximates estrogens available for cellular metabolism, the rate of catechol estrogen metabolism may be determined from (Formula; see text) From published data K = 12.4 +/- 0.8 of the standard error of the mean. Pearson correlation coefficients between actual and estimated catechol estrogen excretion in groups of subjects ranged from 0.61 to 0.97 (median, 0.88). This method has been useful for clinical investigation of the relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease until better methods to measure catechol estrogen directly are available. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Transoral decompression evaluated by cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging: a case of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation. Cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging provides simultaneous images of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed. 
Treatment of recurrent urethral strictures using clean intermittent self-catheterisation. The treatment of urethral strictures has been greatly improved by the use of the optical urethrotome. However, there remains a group of patients with recurrent strictures for whom the alternatives remain long-term dilatation/urethrotomy or urethroplasty. Over the last 3 years we have treated 65 such patients using clean intermittent self-catheterisation as a method of self-dilatation. This has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of operations performed on these patients, with no significant reduction in urinary flow rate over an average follow-up period of 20 months. The method offers the possibility of long-term cure and should be offered to all all such patients, reducing still further the number of patients who require urethroplasty. 
Immunoturbidimetric assay for estimating free light chains of immunoglobulins in urine and serum. An immunoturbidimetric assay for the assessment of free kappa and lambda light chains of immunoglobulins was developed using a commercial polyclonal antiserum with reactivity towards epitopes on the light chains, which are not expressed when they are bound to heavy chains. The assay, on a centrifugal analyser, is simple and rapid. The limit of detection is 5 mg/l of free light chain, with an assay range of 5-120 mg/l, intrabatch precisions from 1.5-6.4%, and interbatch precisions from 6.5-8.9%. The assay was only slightly less sensitive than colloidal gold staining of cellulose acetate electrophoreses for the detection of Bence-Jones protein in urine. For the serial monitoring of response to chemotherapy in patients with myeloma, the assay correlated well with serum paraprotein estimates obtained by densitometric scanning of Ponceau stained cellulose acetate electrophoreses, but not with serum beta-2 microglobulin measurements, even after correction for the effects of creatinine. These assays may prove to be of use for the monitoring of tumour response in the treatment of Bence-Jones myeloma. 
Avoidance of tolerance and lack of rebound with intermittent dose titrated transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. The Transdermal Nitrate Investigators. OBJECTIVES--To investigate the efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate given continuously and with a nocturnal nitrate free period. DESIGN--Double blind placebo controlled study with two parallel limbs. SETTING--Multicentre trial. PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 to 108) (p less than 0.05), and total exercise duration increased by 40 seconds (p less than 0.05). These changes were not seen after continuous treatment. The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of "rebound" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment. 
Physiologic stress and cellular ischemia: relationship to immunosuppression and susceptibility to sepsis. Multiple organ system failure secondary to infection is the most frequent cause of late mortality after hemorrhage, burns, and trauma. Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting. 
Is routine CT scanning necessary in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy? To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective. 
Double dissociation of short-term and long-term memory for nonverbal material in Parkinson's disease and global amnesia. A further analysis. The traditional concept of memory disorder is deficiency of the long-term (LTM) but not short-term (STM) component of memory. STM impairment with LTM sparing is seldom reported. The present study investigated STM and LTM for nonverbal material in three neurological conditions associated with memory impairment: bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (patient H.M.), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems. 
Traumatic anterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and craniofacial considerations. Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistulae may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the head and neck surgeon. The clinical presentation may be obscured by associated injuries. This article serves as a guide in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of patients with dural fistulae of the anterior cranial fossa. 
Morphologic features and nuclide composition of infarction-associated cardiac myocyte mineralization in humans. Low dietary Mg results in Ca loading of cardiac myocytes, which increases the likelihood of myocyte calcification in the event of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and possibly increases myocyte vulnerability to necrosis. Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite. 
Bacterial meningitis: T cell activation and immunoregulatory CD4+ T cell subset alteration. Meningitis is the most important cause of acquired postnatal deafness and neurologic disorders in children. To determine if cell-mediated immunity is casually related to the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, T cell subsets were quantitated from blood of the 29 children with clinical and bacteriologic diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis bacterial meningitis. The CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in patients with meningitis as compared to patient control subjects (bacterial infections without meningitis) and normal healthy control subjects. An elevated percentage of CD25+ (interleukin-2 receptors) and HLA-DR+ (immune-response gene-associated antigen) T cells were detected from all patients with meningitis. All 29 patients with meningitis had highly elevated CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocally depressed CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched normal and patient control subjects. These findings indicate characteristic immunologic T cell abnormalities from meningitis. The abnormal increase in the CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor-inducer or "virgin" cells and expression of activation antigens on T cells may be of help in future understanding of abnormal immune reactions from bacterial meningitis. However, deficiency of the CD4+ CDw29+ helper-inducer or "memory" cells may contribute to the impaired helper function for B cell-induced protective antibody synthesis to bacterial capsular polysaccharides found in this disease. 
Androgen responses to acutely increased endogenous insulin levels in hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. We examined androgen responses in hyperandrogenic (polycystic ovarian disease [PCOD]) and normal women after an acute endogenous insulin elevation. Standard intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs), modified to include a tolbutamide injection 20 minutes after IVGTTs, were performed. Polycystic ovarian disease patients were studied in the untreated state, after 6 weeks of ovarian androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate, after a 6-week rest period, and after 6 weeks of antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone. Normal menstruating women were studied during the early follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of a single cycle. An acute rise in insulin did not alter serum testosterone or androstenedione levels in PCOD or normal women. A significant rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after modified IVGTTs was found in both hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. Although these results are not supportive of the theory that insulin acts on the ovary to stimulate androgen production, they may be because of the short time course of insulin elevation that occurs during an IVGTT. 
Hypersensitivity myocarditis. Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions. 
5-Fluorouracil after trabeculectomy and the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Nine patients (nine eyes) with iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome underwent trabeculectomy and received postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to enhance bleb formation (total 5-FU dose, 30-105 mg; mean, 53.8 mg). Eight eyes had undergone prior unsuccessful trabeculectomy. Four eyes had intraocular pressure (IOP) less than or equal to 21 mmHg on zero to two glaucoma medications after 6 to 54 months of follow-up (mean, 25.3 months). Five eyes required repeat surgery within 2 to 13 months and were considered failures. All five eyes that failed received a Molteno drainage implant. Progressive endothelial proliferation may explain late onset bleb failure and the relative ineffectiveness of 5-FU in this condition. 
Changes in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of "hepatic functional reserve." Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and magnesium conservation in patients with congestive cardiac failure. OBJECTIVE--To investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce diuretic induced magnesium excretion in patients in congestive cardiac failure. DESIGN--Cohort analytic study. SETTING--A London district general hospital. SUBJECTS--Thirty four patients with chronic congestive cardiac failure caused by ischaemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy selected consecutively from inpatients under the care of two consultant cardiologists. Nineteen patients (group 1) on diuretics alone were compared with 15 patients (group 2) taking diuretics plus either enalapril or captopril. All drug regimens were stable for at least three months before the study. Patients with impaired renal function (plasma creatinine greater than 120 mumol/l) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS--An intravenous loading dose of magnesium sulphate was given to minimise the variability in baseline magnesium state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Total urine magnesium excretion and creatinine clearance in 24 hour urine collections. RESULTS--Plasma magnesium was similar in the two groups. However, 24 hour urine magnesium excretion was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. Furthermore, creatinine clearance was also significantly lower in group 2 and correlated strongly with magnesium excretion. There was no such relation in group 1. There was no difference in fractional clearance of magnesium between groups. CONCLUSION--Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have an important magnesium conserving action, possibly via their effect on glomerular filtration rate. 
Diagnostic x-ray procedures and risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 5;265(21):2810] Exposure to diagnostic x-rays and the risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma were studied within two prepaid health plans. Adult patients with leukemia (n = 565), NHL (n = 318), and multiple myeloma (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 1390), and over 25,000 x-ray procedures were abstracted from medical records. Dose response was evaluated by assigning each x-ray procedure a score based on estimated bone marrow dose. X-ray exposure was not associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignant conditions never linked to radiation (relative risk [RR], 0.66). For all other forms of leukemia combined (n = 358), there was a slight elevation in risk (RR, 1.17) but no evidence of a dose-response relationship when x-ray procedures near the time of diagnosis were excluded. Similarly, patients with NHL were exposed to diagnostic x-ray procedures more often than controls (RR, 1.32), but the RR fell to 0.99 when the exposure to diagnostic x-ray procedures within 2 years of diagnosis was ignored. For multiple myeloma, overall risk was not significantly high (RR, 1.14), but there was consistent evidence of increasing risk with increasing numbers of diagnostic x-ray procedures. These data suggest that persons with leukemia and NHL undergo x-ray procedures frequently just prior to diagnosis for conditions related to the development or natural history of their disease. There was little evidence that diagnostic x-ray procedures were causally associated with leukemia or NHL. The risk for multiple myeloma, however, was increased among those patients who were frequently exposed to x-rays. 
Urological aspects of Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease, affecting mostly young males in the Mediterranean countries and Japan, is a multi-system disease with urological manifestations. In this prospective study of 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Behcet's disease, we found that 89% of the males had experienced scrotal ulceration and 6% had epididymitis. We also observed sterile urethritis in 3%. Other urological abnormalities appeared to be coincidental findings. 
A randomized trial of five cisplatin-containing treatments in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Six hundred eighty assessable patients with measureable stage III M1, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to one of five treatment arms including cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) +/- methylglyoxal bisguanylhydrazone (MGBG; PVp, PVpM); cisplatin, vinblastine (PVe); or PVe alternating with vinblastine, mitomycin (PVeMi); or fluorouracil, vincristine, mitomycin/cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin (FOMi/CAP). The overall response rate was 20% with 3% complete responses and 17% partial remissions. The duration of these responses was not statistically different by treatment regimen and varied from 2.7 months to 5.0 months. The overall median survival for all patients was 5.3 months and is not different by treatment. Toxicity was greater in PVpM. The similarity of results for response, duration of response, and survival does not establish the superiority of any of these platinum-based regimens for standard clinical usage. 
Did prognosis after acute myocardial infarction change during the past 30 years? A meta-analysis. Much effort has been spent to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction. To investigate how effective this effort has been, a meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1960 and 1987 concerning mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Thirty-six studies were analyzed. They were classified with respect to deaths in the hospital and at 1 month and the 5-year mortality rate starting at hospital discharge. Mortality was assessed from all studies by comparing studies from different institutions with use of identical inclusion criteria (externally controlled studies) and by analyzing studies reporting on changes in mortality in two or more comparable patient cohorts admitted to the same institution at different time periods (internally controlled studies). Reports on clinical trials (for example, thrombolytic therapy, beta-adrenergic blockade) in acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Average overall in-hospital mortality decreased from 29% during the 1960s to 21% during the 1970s and to 16% during the 1980s. The externally controlled studies also showed a declining trend: from 1960 to 1969, 32%, from 1970 to 1979, 19% and from 1980 to 1987, 15%. The 1-month overall mortality rate decreased from 31% during the 1960s to 25% during the 1970s and 18% during the 1980s externally controlled studies. Most internally controlled studies also showed significant improvement in in-hospital and 1-month survival. In contrast, 5-year mortality after hospital discharge did not significantly decrease (33% from 1960 to 1969 and 33% from 1970 to 1979). It is concluded that in the prethrombolytic era, short-term prognosis after acute myocardial infarction has improved since 1960. 
Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. 
Recent advances in the treatment of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary efforts have defined a number of prognostic factors and newer strategies to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. Conservative surgery has led to improved functional and cosmetic results. The development of a number of effective adjuvant regimens has led to improved survival. In patients with stage I disease, several biological characteristics of tumor have been identified that are associated with increased risk of relapse. A multimodality approach to patients with locally advanced disease and inflammatory cancer has resulted in improved survival. A number of hormonal and cytotoxic drug contaminations can palliate metastatic disease, with a small fraction of patients remaining in extended remission. Dose-intensive programs may lead to further improvements in survival of selected patients with this disease. 
Tamoxifen in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a review. The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration. 
Structure and expression of the cDNA encoding human neutrophil collagenase. We have isolated and characterized a 2.4-kb cDNA clone encoding human neutrophil collagenase (HNC), a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases restricted to secondary granules within neutrophils. Partial amino acid sequence was used to deduce oligonucleotide probes. These probes were used to screen a human granulocyte cDNA library derived from messenger RNA (mRNA) from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Cell-free translation of RNA produced from the cDNA produced a 52-Kd protein that was recognized by anti-HNC antibody. The cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to encode a 467-residue protein whose sequence matched those regions currently known for HNC. The enzyme exhibits 58% homology to human fibroblast collagenase and has the same domain structure. It consists of a 20-residue signal peptide, and an 80-residue propeptide that is lost on autolytic activation by cleavage of an M-L bond. Other regions identified include the autolytic degradation site, the "cysteine switch" residue that is involved in latency and activation, and a putative zinc binding sequence. HNC has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA in RNA from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not to RNA from uninduced HL60 cells or HL60 cells that had been induced to undergo granulocytic or monocytic maturation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively. These results parallel those seen with lactoferrin and transcobalamin I, two other secondary granule proteins. 
Treatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience. Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality. 
Coronary-heart-disease risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population in the 1980s. The traditional Cretan diet has been associated with low coronary-heart-disease (CHD) mortality rates. This study reports on the prevalence of CHD risk factors among 387 Cretan bank employees. Mean cholesterol concentration has risen by 36% over 26-y; dietary intake has changed: consumption of meat, fish, and cheese has increased and consumption of bread, fruit, and potatoes has decreased. Although the percentage contribution of fat to total energy intake has decreased from 40% to 36%, there has been a reduction in monounsaturated fatty acid consumption and an increase in the consumption of saturated fatty acids whereas the consumption of polyunsaturates has not been altered. Exception for diminished physical activity, the prevalence of other risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and body mass index) remained relatively stable over this period. These changes in the CHD risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population occurred over a period in which CHD mortality rates are reported to have increased. 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Isradipine for treatment of acute hypertension after myocardial revascularization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and duration of action of iv isradipine in the control of postoperative hypertension immediately after myocardial revascularization. DESIGN: Prospective, phase 2 trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU, university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one (15 male, six female) patients, ages 49 to 75 yr (mean 65 +/- 5), undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-one patients with postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass graft surgery received iv isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist. Mean duration of the isradipine infusion was 96.9 +/- 29 min. Mean dose of isradipine, indexed to weight, was 16.63 +/- 6.66 micrograms/kg (n = 20). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of the 21 patients achieved satisfactory BP control. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), first noted at the 15-min point, was maximal at 1 hr when MAP decreased from 102 +/- 9 mm Hg baseline to 81 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .01), accompanied by a significant (p less than .01) decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1753 +/- 339 baseline to 1180 +/- 229 dyne.sec/cm5. The CVP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and cardiac index increased; however, stroke volume index did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an acceptable agent for the treatment of hypertension in this setting. 
Value of CT in determining the need for angiography when findings of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs are equivocal. The role of CT in determining the need for angiography in patients with possible thoracic vascular injury resulting from blunt trauma is controversial. During a 24-month period, we prospectively evaluated the results of CT to screen 90 patients with a history of decelerating thoracic trauma for evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage or great vessel abnormality. All patients either had equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs (64%) or had technically suboptimal chest radiographs owing to body habitus or restriction to the supine projection (36%). Patients with unequivocal signs of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs underwent immediate arteriography without prior CT. Thoracic CT was interpreted as normal in 63 (77%) patients and no further imaging was performed. Five patients had technically suboptimal CT studies, and CT scans were interpreted as equivocal in six. These 11 patients had normal arteriograms. Sixteen CT scans (18%) demonstrated evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage and/or great vessel contour abnormality. Four (27%) of 15 patients who underwent arteriography had injury to the great vessels. One patient refused to undergo angiography. In 11 patients with CT evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage, major vascular injury was not seen on arteriography. These results suggest a valuable role for CT in determining the need for arteriography to detect potential great vessel injury in patients with blunt decelerating thoracic trauma and equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs. 
Percutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of thrombosis of lower extremity arterial reconstructions. Vascular grafts may be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy after acute occlusion as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy. From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus: case report and review of surgical pathology. Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus is both a rare presentation for melanoma and a cause of oesophageal neoplasm. It accounts for less than 0.1% of all primary oesophageal neoplasms. It was first recognised as a primary tumour by de la Pava et al who showed the presence of melanocytes within oesophageal mucosa. This case report includes a review of the surgical pathology. Even though it is a rare lesion it must be considered as a cause of polypoidal oesophageal lesions as both its diagnosis and treatment can present problems. It is usually fatal within one year. 
Incidence and characteristics of preventable iatrogenic cardiac arrests We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients. 
Long-term maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis with omeprazole. Prospective study in patients with H2-blocker-resistant esophagitis. Thirty-four patients with H2-blocker-resistant reflux esophagitis subsequently healed by 40 mg omeprazole daily entered a maintenance study with 20 mg omeprazole. In 31 evaluable cases the observation period was at least 12 months (mean 24 months). Esophagitis remained in remission in two thirds of patients despite dose reduction. Relapses of esophagitis occurred in 10 cases within six months, which rapidly healed by increasing the omeprazole dose to 40 mg. No further recurrence with 20 mg omeprazole was found later than six months. Peptic strictures primarily requiring repeated dilatation in six patients during healing with omeprazole did not reappear while on omeprazole maintenance. Major side effects that could be attributed to omeprazole were not observed. Gastrin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range in the vast majority. It is concluded that omeprazole maintenance treatment in severe reflux esophagitis is an effective and safe therapy. 
Assessment of the defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy. The defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy has been assessed using a radioisotope and dye technique. The median defunctioning capacity in patients without episodes of fecal discharge per rectum (n = 18) was 99.99 percent and was not affected by body position or the formation of a dependent stoma. In patients (n = 4) who passed fecal material per rectum but who had no stomal retraction, the median defunctioning efficiency was 99.99 percent, and continued fecal discharge was considered to be due to mucopurulent secretion from active distal disease. In patients who passed fecal material per rectum and also had a retracted stoma (n = 4), the defunctioning efficiency was significantly reduced (median = 84.70 [31.2-99.10 percent; P less than 0.01]), owing to the overspill into the distal limb. Two patients underwent stomal revision, with an improvement in defunctioning efficiency to 99.99 percent. 
Endocrine responses to long-term administration of the antiprogesterone RU486 in patients with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine endocrine and clinical responses to long-term administration of RU486 in patients with endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective open trial. SETTING: Faculty practice of the authors. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Six normally cycling women with endometriosis were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received RU486 100 mg/d for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormonal changes during RU486 were compared with control data obtained in the preceding cycle during the early follicular phase. Clinical responses were determined by patient assessment and second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: All women became amenorrheic, and daily urinary levels of ovarian steroid metabolites remained acyclic. Mean luteinizing hormone (LH) (P less than 0.02) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) were increased without changes in LH pulse frequency. An antiglucocorticoid effect was demonstrated by an increase in serum cortisol (P less than 0.01) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P less than 0.05) levels. Treatment resulted in an improvement in pelvic pain in all subjects without significant change in the extent of disease as evaluated by follow-up laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of RU486 results in acyclic ovarian function and improvement in the subjective painful symptoms of endometriosis. 
Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent. Fluconazole is a recently approved agent for the treatment of certain fungal infections. Based on available studies, the drug is clearly effective in oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunosuppressed hosts. Current evidence suggests it may be more efficacious than other azole drugs for oropharyngeal disease. It is probably also effective in other infections due to Candida species, but controlled studies are lacking. Fluconazole is also efficacious in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but recent reports question its use as initial therapy in HIV-infected patients with this illness. The drug, however, is clearly more effective than amphotericin B in the suppression of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients and is the treatment of choice in this situation. 
Hypophysectomy inhibits the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha by rat macrophages: partial restoration by exogenous growth hormone or interferon gamma. We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis. 
Mentally retarded individuals--a population at risk? When comparing the aging process of mentally retarded (MR) persons with the nondisabled population, researchers have established an earlier lower limit for the onset of old age for MR persons and a higher mortality rate. The reason for early senescence has not been successfully resolved, but the finding that cardiovascular disorders are the most prevalent form of disease among elderly MR persons suggests a relationship between lifestyles and higher mortality rate. Indeed, studies that evaluated the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of MR individuals demonstrated substandard levels of fitness. The results of these studies, however, are not conclusive due to variation in test methodologies, motivational factors, and issues of test validity and reliability. Training studies which have purported to determine trainability of this population have also shown confusing results, perhaps attributed to the same protocol inconsistencies. Therefore, the purposes of this article are 1) to review previous methods of evaluating CVF of MR adults and determine whether testing methodologies invalidate the results of these studies, 2) to review training studies involving adult MR individuals and determine whether this population is capable of improving their CVF, and 3) to identify areas where further research is needed to fully describe the functional cardiovascular characteristics of MR adults. 
Case report: cisplatin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. Two patients developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE), following red blood cell transfusion in a setting of acute cisplatin nephropathy. One manifested the full picture of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the other had transient features following blood transfusion. We further reviewed the clinical records on blood transfusion for all patients with cisplatin nephropathy. A third case of (NCPE) was identified in a patient with acute renal dysfunction. However, none of the 16 patients with cisplatin-induced, mild stable chronic renal impairment had pulmonary dysfunction or other laboratory evidence for microangiopathy following transfusion. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be a rare manifestation of cisplatin toxicity. Caution is indicated in transfusing patients with acute platinum nephropathy even in the absence of overt microangiopathy. The pathogenesis of this syndrome and the cause for NCPE is unclear. The literature is reviewed and discussed. 
Ventriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus and cardiac valvulopathy: an echocardiographic evaluation. A group of 20 patients with ventriculoatrial shunts placed as surgical treatment for hydrocephalus were evaluated for cardiac lesions, particularly of the tricuspid valve. Patients with histories of septic or thromboembolic events were excluded. In each patient a clinical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray film and M-mode, two-dimensional and pulsed continuous wave and color-coded Doppler echocardiography were performed. Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely. 
Extensive pulmonary embolism presenting as severe adult respiratory distress syndrome after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy. A rare case of severe adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with a Po2 of 9 mm Hg after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy at 10 weeks' gestation was treated successfully with positive end-expiratory pressure. The underlying cause, extensive pulmonary embolism, was subsequently revealed. The patient survived without residual brain damage. The possible causes of adult respiratory distress syndrome in pregnancy are discussed. 
Comparison of rubidium-82 positron emission tomography and thallium-201 SPECT imaging for detection of coronary artery disease. The diagnostic performance of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) positron emission tomography (PET) and thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for detecting coronary artery disease was investigated in 81 patients (52 men, 29 women). PET studies using 60 mCi of Rb-82 were performed at baseline and after intravenous infusion of 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole in conjunction with handgrip stress. Tl-201 SPECT was performed after dipyridamole-handgrip stress and, in a subset of patients, after treadmill exercise. Sensitivity, specificity and overall diagnostic accuracy were assessed using both visually and quantitatively interpreted coronary angiograms. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET for detection of coronary artery disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) were 84, 88 and 85%, respectively. In comparison, the performance of SPECT revealed a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 53% (p less than 0.05 vs PET) and accuracy of 79%. Similar results were obtained using either visual or quantitative angiographic criteria for severity of coronary artery disease. In 43 patients without prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity for detection of disease was 71 and 73%, respectively, similar for both PET and SPECT. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between imaging modalities when 2 different modes of stress (exercise treadmill vs intravenous dipyridamole plus handgrip) were used with SPECT imaging. Thus, Rb-82 PET provides improved specificity compared with Tl-201 SPECT for identifying coronary artery disease, most likely due to the higher photon energy of Rb-82 and attenuation correction provided by PET. However, post-test referral cannot be entirely excluded as a potential explanation for the lower specificity of Tl-201 SPECT. 
Treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea with a dental orthosis. A dental orthosis, designed to increase the size of the upper airway by advancing the mandible, was used in 68 patients to treat snoring and varying degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. The orthosis increased the posterior airway space, as assessed by lateral cephalograms. Seven months (range 2 to 25) after beginning use, 75 percent of patients were using the orthosis regularly. Snoring, by report, was improved in all patients but one (p less than 0.001) and was eliminated in 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval 30 to 55 percent). Sleep quality and sleepiness were also reported improved. Apneas and hypopneas, measured before and after use in 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, were reduced from an average of 47 to 20 events per hour (p less than 0.001). Oxygenation and sleep disturbance were also improved. Apnea-hypopnea frequency was reduced with treatment to less than 20/h in 13 patients. Residual frequencies greater than 20/h were associated with higher initial frequencies of apneas and hypopneas. Side effects of orthosis use were minor, and no serious complications were observed. The dental orthosis is an effective treatment for the symptom of snoring and can also effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea of moderate severity. 
Prolactin reduction after combined therapy for prolactin macroadenomas. The ability of surgery or bromocriptine to produce endocrine control of a prolactin macroadenoma decreases as the prolactin level increases. Guidelines for the use of multimodality therapy have not been developed for tumors associated with markedly elevated prolactin levels. We reviewed the records of 21 patients with prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/ml treated by transsphenoidal surgery and postoperative radiotherapy with or without a dopamine agonist. Values before and after treatment were available for 19 patients (13 men and 6 women). The mean basal prolactin level before treatment for the entire group was 2410 ng/ml. Surgery and radiotherapy resulted in a 90% reduction and serum prolactin levels within normal limits in 0 of 7 patients, versus the combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and dopamine agonist, which resulted in a 99.5% reduction and values within the normal range in 12 of 12 patients. Spontaneous physiological improvement was not often observed. One woman and two men were able subsequently to have children. A plan for these patients is discussed. 
Stereotactic brain biopsy in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Fifteen patients with cerebral involvement by malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were identified, among more than 200 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. All but one of these cases were diagnosed accurately by the stereotactic biopsy procedure. In 12 of 14 patients, the material was adequate to classify the lymphoma according to the Working Formulation. Because all but one of the lesions were intermediate or high-grade neoplasms, a diagnosis of lymphoma was often possible by conventional light microscopic examination alone. Monotypic light chain expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical techniques in six patients, and positivity for B-cell markers was observed in an additional case. In one instance, two stereotactic biopsy specimens were interpreted as being suggestive of lymphoma, but necrosis and inflammation prevented a definitive diagnosis. Nine patients had no known risk factors for cerebral lymphoma, and the diagnosis often was unsuspected clinically. 
Multivariate clinical models and quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging to predict cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and are at increased risk for cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography. 
A randomized, controlled trial of treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with parenteral nutrition and oxandrolone. II. Short-term effects on nitrogen metabolism, metabolic balance, and nutrition. Patients with moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis, described in a companion paper in this issue, had serial studies of energy and protein metabolism and elemental balances before and during treatment for 21 days with one of four randomly assigned regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 liters of 3.5% crystalline amino acids in 5% dextrose given by peripheral vein (PPN) plus standard therapy; and 4) a combination of the other three treatments. Dietary and intravenous intakes and weights were recorded daily, and weekly averages were calculated. Anthropometric measurements and blood studies were done weekly; blood studies included white blood cell counts and differentials, serum prealbumin, transferrin, and total protein and plasma aminograms. Four-days complete balance studies and measures of 15N,1-13C-leucine metabolism also were performed at baseline and after the treatment period. Major findings were as follows: a) Intakes of total calories and protein were significantly higher in PPN-treated than in other groups. b) All patients had positive elemental balances, both at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. However, those treated with PPN (with or without oxandrolone) had higher positive balances of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, indicating improvement in lean body mass. c) Anthropometric measurements showed no significant changes, but measures of the visceral protein compartment (serum prealbumin, transferrin, total protein, total lymphocyte count) improved significantly with time. For most of these variables, increases were significantly greater in those treated with PPN with or without oxandrolone than in the other groups. However, for prealbumin, the increase was greatest in the oxandrolone-treated group d) PPN treatment produced dramatic increases in levels of branched-chain amino acids and improvement in the ratio of plasma branched chain to aromatic amino acids. Other treatments had no effect on plasma aminograms. e) Metabolism of 15N,1-13C-leucine was normal and was not affected significantly by treatment. Therapy with PPN and/or oxandrolone was tolerated well. We conclude that PPN has favorable effects on energy and protein metabolism in florid alcoholic hepatitis; oxandrolone has lesser effects, although it may exert some additional action and particularly increases serum prealbumin levels. The results support the use of nutritional supplementation in therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
William Heberden and Myron Prinzmetal: angina pectoris. The most significant accounts of angina pectoris appeared in the medical literature separated by nearly two centuries. They were Heberden's initial description of classic angina and Prinzmetal's report of the variant form. Angina pectoris represents a transient myocardial oxygen deficiency. It is usually related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but there are a number of less common etiologies, most notably aortic stenosis. Stable and unstable forms exist, with stable angina being further subclassified as being of one of four patterns: classic, variant, atypical, and angina equivalent. 
The Purkinje cell and its afferents in human hereditary ataxia. The cerebellar cortex in patients with autosomal dominant and recessive ataxia was studied by Golgi impregnation and immunocytochemistry in order to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of neuronal atrophy which accompanies these disorders. Monoclonal antisera were used to visualize phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, and a synapse-specific protein (P38; synaptophysin). Golgi stain and immunocytochemistry for non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein revealed partial or complete loss of distal Purkinje cell dendrities in the dominant cases and in one recessive case. Many preserved parallel fibres were shown by the monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated neurofilament protein. This antibody also gave strong reaction product in torpedoes. Axosomatic and axodendritic terminals on Purkinje cells were reduced in number, and loss of mossy fiber terminals was revealed by monoclonal anti-P38. The described methods provided additional morphological evidence of the heterogeneity of the hereditary ataxias. Purkinje cell atrophy progressed from loss and simplification of the dendritic tree to disappearance of the cell body. While these cells appeared to be especially vulnerable, other neurons of the molecular and granular layers were not exempt. There was evidence that at least some extracerebellar afferents, such as mossy fibers, were also affected by the disease process. 
Salvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in the treatment of primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors. The authors reported their experience with the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) as salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors (PMGCT). Since 1987, the authors have treated 12 patients with PMGCT with high-dose carboplatin (1500 mg/m2 to 1800 mg/m2) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2) (in two patients ifosfamide [10 g/m2] was added) with ABMR. Patients were either in second relapse or cisplatin refractory (progression within 4 weeks of last cisplatin dosing). They had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range, one to three), all had had prior cisplatin therapy, and most had failed ifosfamide-based therapy. Six patients were cisplatin refractory and of these only one achieved a partial response (PR) that was of short duration. It was planned that all patients would undergo two rounds of therapy; however, only 5 of 12 patients received two courses. The remainder had only one round of therapy either because of inadequate response (three patients) or excessive toxicity (four patients). There were four patients who died in the peritransplant period due to sepsis (two patients) or bleeding (two patients). The median survival of the group was 107 days (range, 14 days to 347 days). No patient achieved a complete remission, but there were six partial remissions, four with stable disease, and two with progressive disease. The use of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide and ABMR was not effective in the treatment of this group of patients with PMGCT who were in second relapse or cisplatin refractory. 
Predictors of physical functioning after a cardiac event. An increased understanding of the factors that promote or hinder patients' return to optimal activity levels after a cardiac event is necessary to help them achieve this goal. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine psychologic resources, depression, physical recovery, and illness severity for their relationships with subjective and objective physical functioning (exercise data). A correlational survey design was used to assess patients' (n = 46) illness responses 9 weeks after the cardiac event. Patients also participated in a symptom-limited exercise test. The findings suggested that the individual's return to greater activity levels after a cardiac illness was associated with less depression and illness severity, and higher levels of objective physical functioning, physical recovery, and self-esteem. Further, patients' objective physical functioning was associated not only with greater subjective physical functioning but also with greater levels of physical recovery and mastery. 
Electronic fetal heart monitoring, auscultation, and neonatal outcome. In a large randomized, controlled study of fetal heart rate monitoring with either continuous electronic fetal heart monitoring or auscultation at specified intervals, only one pattern of deviation in the fetal heart rate correlated significantly with neonatal neurologic examinations at 0 to 48 hours and 72 hours to 1 week: late decelerations in stage 1 and in stage 2. Other variables from labor and delivery, specifically, duration of labor after hospital admission, failure of labor to progress, number of fetal scalp pH values, and presence of meconium were important predictors of neonatal outcome in the regression analyses. The fetal heart rate deviations did contribute significantly to the percent variance accounted for in the regression analyses with neonatal outcomes of Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and serial neonatal neurologic examinations. 
Hydrocortisone inhibits rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by neutrophil-derived histamine releasing activity as well as by anti-IgE. We determined the ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by anti-IgE and by neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N). Serotonin release induced by HRA-N and anti-IgE was inhibited by 78 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively (IC50 7.5 x 10(-7)M) by hydrocortisone (10(-5)M). HRA-N does not cause arachidonic acid metabolism, however, anti-IgE induced the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene (LT)C4, and the generation of both mediators was inhibited by 10(-5)M hydrocortisone (IC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7)M, and 3.6 x 10(-9)M, respectively). Inhibition required at least 5 to 6 h of hydrocortisone exposure and was maximal after 22 h. The observed effects of hydrocortisone could be reproduced by human recombinant lipocortin-I (5 x 10(-7)M). Hydrocortisone, 10(-5)M, was a less potent inhibitor of calcium ionophore A23187-mediated serotonin release and PGD2 and LTC4 generation (inhibition of 20 +/- 2, 17 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 10%, respectively). Inasmuch as A23187-induced stimulation is not dependent on receptor coupling, the enhanced ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit IgE- and HRA-N-mediated events as compared with A23187 suggests that one possible site of action of hydrocortisone may be interruption of receptor-effector signals. In the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrocortisone-treated cells released as much LTB4 and PGD2 as control cells, however, serotonin release and LTC4 generation were inhibited 50 and 55%, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that hydrocortisone has three possible sites of action: 1) inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, 2) inhibition of glutathione-s-transferase, and 3) inhibition of serotonin release by a third mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems. 
Geographic variations in the histologic characteristics of the gastric mucosa. Histologic sections of 205 gastrectomy specimens, which were obtained for benign and malignant diseases, were reviewed. All patients were Mexican nationals. The following histologic features were recorded: intestinal metaplasia, intramucosal cysts, ciliated gastric cells, and different types of pyloric cells ("ordinary"; with granular cytoplasm; with small cytoplasmic vacuoles; with large cytoplasmic vacuoles; or with homogeneous "glassy" cytoplasm). The percentage of specimens showing intestinal metaplasia was similar in those containing gastric ulcers (42.7%) or adenocarcinomas (50.0%). Intestinal metaplasia was decreased in men 59 years of age or older and in women 69 years of age or older. Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% of the gastric tumors. Only 3 of the 205 specimens (1.9%) contained intramucosal cysts, and only 1 (0.4%) showed ciliated cells. Pyloric cells with granular cytoplasm were observed in 21.2% of the specimens, and pyloric cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in 1.9%. Pyloric cells with large vacuoles or "glassy" cytoplasm were not found in any case. These results indicate differences in the proportions of several histopathologic findings in the gastric mucosa, between Mexicans and other ethnic groups that have been investigated in previous surveys. The authors' findings support the hypothesis that different environmental factors, acting in disparate geographic regions, may account for dissimilarities in the histologic appearance of "normal gastric mucosa.". 
T-lymphocyte dysfunctions occurring together with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies. Gut epithelial cell autoantibodies have been considered a hallmark of autoimmune enteropathy, a disorder occurring in children with protracted diarrhea of unknown etiology. Four patients (two male and two female) with such autoantibodies were studied. Immunofluorescence analysis showed two different disjunctive staining patterns: complement-fixing apical (three of four) and cytoplasmic (the remaining fourth one), which are shown to be directed against different structures. All three patients positive for complement-fixing apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies had abnormal T-cell responses in vitro, one of them with an immunoglobulin G2 immunoglobulin deficiency and another with an immunoglobulin A deficiency. An immunoglobulin A deficiency without T-cell alterations was also diagnosed in the cytoplasmic gut epithelial cell autoantibody-positive patient. These findings suggest that different immunologic alterations (either a T-cell abnormality or immunoglobulin deficiency) may favor the appearance of gut epithelial cell autoantibodies (complement-fixing apical or cytoplasmic, respectively). Furthermore, these autoantibodies should not be considered a specific marker of autoimmune enteropathy, because they may not always be associated with such a disease: two patients with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies showed no signs of intestinal lesion or diarrhea. 
Age-related complications and optimal choice of artificial heart valves in elderly patients. The use of bioprosthetic heart valves in elderly patients is presently advocated by many since implanting mechanical valves are considered to result in unacceptable rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. However the somewhat limited durability of bioprostheses has to be acknowledged since a group of elderly patients will eventually require a reoperation due to tissue failure. We have evaluated our policy to implant mechanical heart valve prostheses even in elderly patients based on the conception that we believe that anticoagulation in this group of patients can be handled with a low rate of complications. 
Massive incisional hernia: abdominal wall replacement with Marlex mesh. Marlex (polypropylene) mesh was used to replace the abdominal wall in massive incisional herniation in 50 patients. Seventeen unsuccessful attempts at primary repair had previously been made on nine patients. Patient follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (mean = 45 months). There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients. In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch. Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent). Complications did not necessitate removal of the patch in any case. Inadequate peripheral attachment of the patch has been the only cause of hernia recurrence and should be avoidable. 
Clinical characteristics of transient ischemic attacks in black patients. We analyzed the clinical, CT, and angiographic findings in 50 black patients with carotid transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Thirty-two percent had TIAs lasting less than 1 hour, 26% had TIAs lasting 1 to 6 hours, and 42% had TIAs lasting 6 to 24 hours. Fifty-two percent of TIA patients had CT evidence of cerebral infarction despite complete clinical recovery. CT was abnormal in two of 16 (13%) patients with TIAs lasting less than 1 hour; however, CT was abnormal in 24 of 34 (70%) patients with TIAs lasting longer than 1 hour. Angiographic findings of extracranial carotid disease appropriate to TIA symptoms were present in 12 (24%) patients. Two patients in whom the TIA episode lasted less than 1 hour later had clinical cerebral infarction, whereas 20 patients with longer-duration TIAs developed ischemic stroke within 4 months. Of these black TIA patients, 22 (44%) developed clinical cerebral infarction. 
Bilateral spontaneous perilymph fistulae: a diagnostic and management dilemma. In this article, we present a case of bilateral perilymph fistulae. This entity is rare and always presents a diagnostic problem. Bilateral perilymph fistulae are more common in children and should be suspected when bilateral ear symptoms and congenital temporal bone radiographic anomalies are present. Previous trauma or barotrauma may be absent. When a patient manifests bilateral ear symptoms and a fistula has been identified and repaired in one ear, a second fistula should be suspected in the contralateral ear, especially if the fistula test is positive. 
Influence of dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and cardiac transplantation on the relation between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and atrial pressures. To determine whether dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiac transplantation affect the relation between plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and cardiac filling pressures, right atrial plasma ANF concentration, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 48), dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis (n = 20) and prior cardiac transplantation (n = 34). ANF level significantly correlated with both pulmonary arterial wedge and right atrial pressures in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; however, the presence or absence of myocarditis did not significantly alter these relations (p = 0.88 and p = 0.33 for interaction terms, respectively). For the combined group the ANF-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure relation had a slope of 8.1 pg/ml/mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4 to 10.8; p = 0.0001) and the ANF-right atrial pressure relation a slope of 13.6 pg/ml/mm Hg (CI, 8.5 to 18.7; p = 0.0001). Receiver operator curve analysis identified an optimal dividing point of ANF 150 pg/ml with 100% (CI, 72 to 100%) of patients with right atrial pressure greater than or equal to 8 mm Hg having ANF greater than or equal to 150 pg/ml, but only 56% (CI, 42 to 69%) with pressure less than 8 mm Hg having ANF less than 150 pg/ml. Unlike the patients with cardiomyopathy (with or without myocarditis), cardiac transplant recipients displayed no correlation between ANF level and either pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p = 0.50) or right atrial pressure (p = 0.29) despite similarly elevated ANF concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation 168 (83) pg/ml in transplant patients versus 185 (114) pg/ml in cardiomyopathy patients). It is concluded that left and right intracardiac pressures are important determinants of circulating ANF level unaffected by inflammation in patients with cardiomyopathy. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Histopathology of incipient fundus flavimaculatus. A 9-year-old boy was diagnosed with fundus flavimaculatus in his left eye. The boy's fellow eye was enucleated at 16 months of age for retinoblastoma. The authors reviewed the material submitted for histopathologic examination and found that the retinal pigment epithelial cells demonstrated increased autofluorescence and increased reactivity to periodic acid-Schiff staining. Many cells had their melanin granules displaced toward the cell apex. The retinal pigment epithelial changes are consistent with previous histopathologic findings in fundus flavimaculatus and imply that the structural changes are seen in early life. 
Head-injured patients who talk and deteriorate into coma. Analysis of 211 cases studied with computerized tomography. Of 838 patients with severe head injuries admitted since the introduction of computerized tomography, 211 (25.1%) talked at some time between trauma and subsequent deterioration into coma. Of these 211 patients, 89 (42.2%) had brain contusion/hematoma, 46 (21.8%) an epidural hematoma, 35 (16.6%) a subdural hematoma, and 41 (19.4%) did not show focal mass lesions. Thus, four of every five patients who deteriorated into coma after suffering an apparently nonsevere head injury had a mass lesion potentially requiring surgery: the mass was intracerebral in 52.3% of the cases and extracerebral in 47.6%. Patients aged 20 years or less had a 39% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion (diffuse brain damage), a 29% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 32% chance of having an intradural mass lesion; patients over 40 years had only a 3% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion, an 18% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 79% chance of having a intradural mass lesion. Sixty-eight (32.2%) patients died and 143 (67.8%) survived. The following were independent outcome predictors (in order of significance): Glasgow Coma Scale score following deterioration into coma, the highest intracranial pressure during the patient's course, the degree of midline shift, the type of intracranial lesion, and the age of the patient. In contrast, the mechanism of injury, the verbal Glasgow Coma Scale score during the lucid interval, and the length of time until deterioration or until operative intervention did not influence the final result. 
Transformation-dependent activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by a plasmin-independent mechanism: involvement of cell surface membranes. Transformed cells produce elevated levels of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), which has been linked with the invasive or migratory phenotype of these cells. The u-PA is secreted and normally maintained in the inactive, single-chain form (scu-PA) and it has been assumed that natural activation occurs via a plasmin-mediated cleavage converting scu-PA to the active, two-chain form (tcu-PA). We now demonstrate that secreted scu-PA in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblast (RSVCEF) cultures is activated by an endogenous, plasmin-independent mechanism. Normal CEFs and CEFs infected with a temperature-sensitive RSV mutant and incubated at the nonpermissive temperature do not activate scu-PA. Conditioned medium harvested from plasmin-free cultures of RSVCEFs contains active tcu-PA as determined by two independent methods. The scu-PA is progressively converted with time in culture and requires the presence of intact cells or a plasma membrane-enriched fraction. When added to RSVCEF cultures, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 20-41 of the growth factor domain of chicken u-PA blocks the conversion to tcu-PA, and scu-PA accumulates in the cultures. These results suggest that scu-PA is secreted by cells, becomes bound to a u-PA receptor, and is proteolytically converted to active tcu-PA by a catalytic mechanism on the surface of RSV-transformed fibroblasts. 
Early prevention of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 May 11;337(8750):1174] Left ventricular dysfunction can be improved with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition started 1 week after myocardial infarction or later. To see whether earlier intervention may confer greater benefit, a double-blind study was carried out in which 100 patients with Q wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomly allocated treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo starting 24-48 h after onset of symptoms. Left ventricular volumes were measured regularly during 3 months of treatment and after a 48 h withdrawal period by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. The placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDVI) and end-systolic (LVESVI) volume indices, with the ejection fraction unchanged. By contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but not significant rise in LVEDVI and a significant reduction in LVESVI with ejection fraction increased significantly. At 3 months there was a 4.6% difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the groups (p less than 0.0001). Most of the treatment benefit was evident at 1 month and there were no changes in left ventricular volumes after 48 h withdrawal of treatment at 3 months. Heart failure requiring treatment with frusemide developed in 7 patients in each group during the study period; 3 of these (1 captopril-treated, 2 placebo-treated) had to be withdrawn from the trial with severe heart failure requiring open treatment. Thus early treatment with captopril is effective in preventing the ventricular dilatation that can occur after Q wave myocardial infarction. 
Loss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 17 is associated with high proliferative capacity and DNA aneuploidy in primary human breast cancer. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) was found in 27 of 52 (52%) previously untreated primary breast cancers. There was a significant correlation between this 17p allelic loss and two parameters associated with aggressive tumor behavior: high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy. These correlations with high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy were not found in tumors with LOH at nine other chromosome locations. The p53 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 17p13, was examined for aberrations to determine whether it is the target for the 17p LOH in breast cancer. Unlike other types of human cancer, there were no homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p53 gene, and only 2 of 13 (15%) were mutated in the conserved region where mutational "hot spots" have been previously located. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in breast cancer, either loss or inactivation of gene(s) on chromosome 17p other than the p53 gene or a different mechanism of p53 gene inactivation may be responsible for the observed high labeling index and DNA aneuploidy associated with LOH at 17p. 
Transurethral resection of prostate prior to definitive irradiation for prostate cancer. Lack of correlation with treatment outcome. From 1970 through 1983, 107 patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated with radiotherapy with curative intent at Duke University Medical Center. Forty-five patients (42%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes prior to beginning radiotherapy. Sixty-one patients (57%) were diagnosed by needle biopsy. TURP and needle biopsy groups were comparable (age, elevated acid phosphatase, early [A2, B] and late [C, D1] disease stages, and follow-up). TURP patients were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors and were more often given concurrent hormonal therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analyses to study the effect of TURP on patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy were done. We were unable to demonstrate any adverse impact of TURP on the outcome of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This issue remains controversial and should be addressed in a prospective, randomized trial. 
Cerebral potentials evoked by painful, laser stimuli in patients with syringomyelia. Brief cutaneous heat stimuli generated by a CO2 laser were used to elicit late somatosensory evoked cerebral potentials (SEPc) in 10 patients with syringomyelia. For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session. In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes. 
The role of the transcerebellar view in the detection of fetal central nervous system anomaly. The current resolution of antenatal ultrasonography permits the sonologist to visualize and critically evaluate the cerebellum and cisterna magna. Abnormalities in the size and shape of these structures will assist the sonologist in the detection of the majority of central nervous system malformations. 
Invasive aspergillosis of the maxilla in an immunocompromised patient. Patients who are immunocompromised have a high susceptibility to infection, which can be fatal. Studies have shown that patients receiving chemotherapeutic and adjunctive medications have inhibited inflammatory response to microbes, particularly those increasing the potential for the development of invasive infection. Aspergillus is a fungus often found in the atmosphere. Colonization of Aspergillus in the upper respiratory tract is common. In the immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus flavus is found to be the most frequent fungus cultured in the maxillary sinus. Because of the depressed immunologic state of the patient, A. flavus can differentiate into hyphal forms producing toxins that destroy epithelial tissues. Penetration of Aspergillus into connective and vascular tissue produces thrombosis and ultimately necrosis of hard and soft tissue. 
Total parenteral nutrition and tumor metastasis. A major clinical concern with providing total parenteral nutrition to the tumor-bearing host is the potential to stimulate tumor growth. This study was performed to determine the effect of total parenteral nutrition on primary tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lobund rats with subcutaneous prostate adenocarcinoma (PA-III) implants. Significant acceleration of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis occurred in animals receiving parenteral nutrition consisting of amino acids, dextrose, and lipid or standard enteral nutrition compared to control animals. This study represents the first report of stimulating tumor metastasis with specific parenteral nutrients and clearly indicates that both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis can be altered by exogenous substrate administration. 
Peptic ulcer pathophysiology. Despite extensive research, the etiology of peptic ulcer disease remains unclear. Given the multiple processes that control acid and pepsin secretion and defense and repair of the gastroduodenal mucosa, it is likely that the cause of ulceration differs between individuals. Acid and pepsin appear to be necessary but not sufficient ingredients in the ulcerative process. It is clear that the majority of gastric ulcers and a substantial number of duodenal ulcers do not have increased gastric acid secretion. Recent research has focused more on protection and repair of the stomach and duodenum. NSAIDs cause a significant number of gastric and duodenal ulcers; this is probably due to inhibition of prostaglandin production with loss of its protective effects. In the absence of NSAIDs and gastrinoma, it appears that most gastric ulcers and all duodenal ulcers occur in the setting of H. pylori infection. Evidence is mounting in support of H. pylori as a necessary ingredient in the ulcerative process, similar to acid and pepsin. It is not known whether the bacteria or the accompanying inflammation is the more important factor in the pathophysiology. Although the pathophysiology of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer is similar, there are clearly differences between the two groups. Duodenal ulcer is typified by H. pylori infection and duodenitis and in many cases impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion in the face of moderate increases in acid and peptic activity. These facts suggest the following process: increased peptic activity coupled with decreased duodenal buffering capacity may lead to increased mucosal injury and result in gastric metaplasia. In the presence of antral H. pylori, the gastric metaplasia can become colonized and inflamed. The inflammation or the infection itself then disrupts the process of mucosal defense or regeneration resulting in ulceration. A cycle of further injury and increased inflammation with loss of the framework for regeneration may then cause a chronic ulcer. Gastric ulcer often occurs with decreased acid-peptic activity, suggesting that mucosal defensive impairments are more important. The combination of inflammation, protective deficiencies, and moderate amounts of acid and pepsin may be enough to induce ulceration. Many questions remain in understanding the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. The physiology and pathophysiology of mucosal regeneration and the mechanisms by which H. pylori and inflammation disrupt normal gastroduodenal function will be fruitful areas of future investigation. 
Prostaglandin-stimulated recovery of the human duodenal epithelium: effects of misoprostol on ethanol damage. This study was designed to determine whether prostaglandins can stimulate the repair of human duodenal epithelium. Ten healthy volunteers were given 50 ml 40% ethanol through an endoscope onto the duodenal mucosa 1-7 cm from the pyloric sphincter; 3 min later, misoprostol (200 micrograms) or inert vehicle (5 ml) was given locally in the same way. One and 5 h later, endoscopy was repeated to evaluate the damage. The conditions of the mucosa were evaluated by endoscopy and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in biopsies taken at time 0 and 3 min, 1 and 5 h after ethanol. The study was double-blind with a cross-over balanced design. Three minutes after ethanol administration, the duodenal mucosa showed hyperemia with hemorrhagic lesions. Under the electron microscope, the lesions were caused by vascular engorgement or red blood cell extravasation into the submucosa; the epithelium underlining lesions showed loss of superficial cells and damage to the upper layer of the mucosa. One hour after ethanol, there was a striking difference between the two treatment groups, with a substantial recovery of the duodenal epithelium in the misoprostol-treated volunteers. Although spontaneous recovery was evident in the control group, there was also a significant difference at 5 h. Our results suggest that prostaglandins are able to stimulate the recovery of the duodenal epithelium after acute damage. 
Relation between p53 overexpression and established prognostic factors in breast cancer. The nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is expressed in all normal cells and appears to function in cell cycle regulation. Abnormally high levels of the protein are found in many different types of cancer. In breast carcinoma overexpression of p53 is associated with point mutations within highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. These altered genes encode stable p53 proteins that can be detected by standard immunohistochemical techniques unable to detect rapidly degraded wild-type protein. The level of p53 expression in 184 primary breast cancer specimens was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and related to the following established prognostic factors for breast cancer: age, stage, metastatic involvement, concentration of estrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferative index, and HER-2/neu overexpression. Fifty (27%) of these primary breast cancer specimens had widespread overexpression of p53. Highly significant associations were found between p53 overexpression and late stage, metastatic spread, and low concentration of progesterone receptors. The presence of elevated levels of mutant p53 may itself be a prognostic factor in human breast cancer and activation of this oncogene may be important in the ability of a tumor to metastasize. 
Angiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. 
Combined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers. A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers. Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period. One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers. 
Proteus syndrome. Ultrastructural study of linear verrucous and depigmented nevi. Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by multifocal overgrowths that can involve any structure of the body. Clinical manifestations include macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, subcutaneous masses, exostosis, cerebroid thickening of palms and soles, and linear skin lesions. About 50 cases have been described, but the ultrastructural features of the linear skin lesions have not been characterized. We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities. 
Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. 
Descriptive epidemiologic study of epilepsy syndromes in a district of northwest Tuscany, Italy. To evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes in a district in Northwest Tuscany (Vecchiano, 9,952 inhabitants) we identified all suspected cases (probable epilepsy) from several information sources: files of local doctors, prescriptions of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), hospital files from the center for epilepsy at the University of Pisa, medical files from university and hospital departments in Pisa, and files of the school doctors and social workers in the district of Vecchiano. All persons suspected of having epilepsy were examined; 51 cases of epilepsy were found, i.e., a prevalence rate of 5.1 in 1,000. During a previous study performed in the same district with the "house-to-house" method, a lower rate was found. Our study confirms that use of different epidemiologic investigational methods can produce different results. 
Future directions of laser phototherapy for diagnosis and treatment of malignancies: fantasy, fallacy, or reality? A new and highly promising adjunctive modality for the diagnosis and therapy of malignancies is under development using lasers and tumor targeting dyes. To reach the eventual goal of clinical treatment, several current "fantasies and fallacies" regarding laser applications in medicine must be identified and their problems clearly outlined. A multidisciplinary scientific approach is also required to enable the clinical practicality of this laser targeting approach. Many new dyes and laser wavelengths are being tested to improve specific tumor uptake and/or retention, lower systemic toxicity, increase tissue penetration, and identify fluorochromes with synergistic properties to further enhance laser tumoricidal effects. Rapid technological advancements in magnetic resonance imaging may now provide an extremely sensitive way to detect and monitor laser-tissue effects, and allow efficient interstitial laser phototherapy of deep and sometimes inaccessible tumors. The current and future prospectives of the emerging field of laser phototherapy are described. 
Cardiomyopathy of the aging human heart. Myocyte loss and reactive cellular hypertrophy. To determine the effects of aging on the human myocardium, 67 hearts were obtained from individuals who died from causes other than cardiovascular disease. The age interval examined was 17-90 years. Regression analysis demonstrated that the aging process was characterized by a loss of 38 million and 14 million myocyte nuclei/yr in the left and right ventricular myocardium, respectively. This loss in muscle mass was accompanied by a progressive increase in myocyte cell volume per nucleus in both ventricles. Left ventricular myocytes enlarged by 110 microns3/yr, whereas right ventricular myocytes increased by 118 microns3/yr, resulting in a preservation of ventricular wall thickness. However, the cellular hypertrophic response was unable to maintain normal cardiac mass. Left and right ventricular weights decreased by 0.70 and 0.21 g/yr, respectively. In conclusion, loss of cells and enlargement of the remaining myocytes may represent the structural basis for the reduced compensatory capacity of the aged heart and together may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction and failure in the elderly. 
Age-related changes in the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: comparative study between young and elderly patients. The natural history of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome remains an intriguing question with respect to clinical decision-making, since serial electrophysiologic data spread over several decades in the same patient are not available in the literature. To study the age-related changes in WPW syndrome, we compared two separate groups of patients referred to this Medical Center for electrophysiologic studies because of a clinical presentation with significant arrhythmias. An elderly group of 42 patients aged 50 years or more were compared with a younger group of 51 patients aged 15 to 30 years. The groups were comparable in terms of clinical presentation, including the number of patients who had reported syncopal episodes and those requiring cardioversion of their tachyarrhythmias. Baseline electrophysiologic variables such as sinus rate; sinoatrial conduction time; corrected sinus node recovery time; AH interval; and effective refractory periods of the right atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node, and right ventricular muscle, were significantly greater in the elderly group. Similarly, the anterograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length with 1:1 anterograde conduction via the bypass tract, retrograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest ventricular pacing cycle length with 1:1 retrograde conduction via the bypass tract, the shortest consecutive preexcited R-R interval during atrial fibrillation, and the cycle length of orthodromic atrial ventricular reciprocating tachycardia were significantly greater in the elderly group. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: MR findings in 35 proved cases. MR images of 28 patients with 35 lesions of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia were reviewed to determine the frequency of findings considered typical of this condition (isointensity on T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, a central hyperintense scar on T2-weighted images, and homogeneous signal intensity). Fifteen lesions were imaged at 0.6 T with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences; 20 lesions were imaged at 1.5 T with T1-weighted SE and gradient-echo pulse sequences and T2-weighted SE pulse sequences. Diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia was made pathologically in 25 patients, with nuclear scintigraphy in four, and with follow-up imaging in six. Only seven lesions (20%) were isointense relative to normal liver on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On T1-weighted SE images, 21 lesions (60%) were isointense relative to normal liver, 12 (34%) were hypointense, and two (6%) were hyperintense. On T2-weighted SE images, 12 lesions (34%) were isointense and 23 (66%) were hyperintense relative to normal liver. A central scar was present in 17 lesions (49%) and was hypointense relative to the lesion on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Twenty lesions (57%) were of homogeneous signal intensity throughout the lesion, except for the presence of a central scar. All three MR imaging characteristics were present in three cases (9%). We conclude that hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia has a wide range of signal intensity on MR imaging. 
Mixed venous oxygen saturation for differentiating stable from unstable tachycardias. Current antitachycardia systems are incapable of adequately distinguishing stable from unstable tachycardias. Previously, integration of a pressure sensor or an impedance sensor, together with electrogram analysis, has been investigated as an improved method of identifying unstable arrhythmias. A mixed venous oxygen saturation sensor was investigated for differentiating stable from unstable paced and induced tachycardias in 10 patients. During rapid pacing at 600, 500, 400, 350, 300, and 250 msec cycle lengths, mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased as cycle length decreased. For any given cycle length, rapid ventricular pacing tended to result in greater mixed venous oxygen desaturation compared with atrial pacing. Mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased similarly during induced ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths greater than 230 msec. However, ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths less than or equal to 230 msec and ventricular fibrillation had no effect on mixed venous oxygen saturation until after termination. Subsequently, a mixed venous oxygen saturation-tiered therapy algorithm (cycle length less than or equal to 230 msec = unstable; cycle length greater than 230 msec and MVO2 greater than or equal to 6% over 30 seconds = unstable) was developed and was tested retrospectively in 113 paced and induced tachyarrhythmias in these 10 patients for detecting unstable tachycardias (defined as a decrease from baseline systolic arterial pressure of greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg at 15 seconds). The mixed venous oxygen algorithm had 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity compared with rate-only (rate greater than or equal to 170 beats/min) detection with 93% sensitivity and 71% specificity. 
Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at higher age or after relapse. To reduce critical neutropenia after chemotherapy (CT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we administered recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to patients over the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed AML and to patients with early or second relapse. CT was 9-day 6-thioguanine, ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD9) in newly diagnosed AML and sequential high-dose ara-C and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) for relapse. In patients whose bone marrow was free from blasts a continuous intravenous infusion of GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d started on day 4 after CT. Thirty-six patients entered the study and 30 of them did receive GM-CSF. For comparison, a historical control group of 56 patients was used. Complete remission rate was 50% (18 of 36) versus 32% in controls (P = .09), and early death rate was 14% versus 39% (P = .009). Treatment with GM-CSF was not associated with major adverse events. Two patients showed a marked leukemic regrowth that was completely reversible in one patient and appeared to be GM-CSF independent in the other patient. Remission duration does not seem to be reduced after GM-CSF. Under GM-CSF the blood neutrophils recovered 6 and 9 days earlier in the TAD9 (P = .009) and S-HAM (P = .043) groups associated with a rapid clearance of infections in most patients. We conclude that GM-CSF was of therapeutic benefit to our patients and this provides a basis for larger controlled trials. 
HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia. Disseminated erythematous papules and plaques developed in a 60-year-old man 3 years before the appearance of neurologic manifestations. A biopsy specimen of the plaque revealed Pautrier's microabscess and a dense mononuclear cell infiltration with atypical convoluted nuclei in the papillary dermis. These cells were helper/inducer T lymphocytes that expressed the interleukin 2 receptor. The patient's white blood cell count was normal, but 1% atypical lymphocytes and a high titer of anti-human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibody were detected in his serum. A smoldering type of adult T-cell leukemia was diagnosed. While he was being treated with PUVA, a gait disturbance developed. A high titer of anti-HTLV-I antibody, characteristic of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, was demonstrated in his cerebrospinal fluid. 
Venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing in the Chinese. To determine the incidence of venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing in the Chinese, venograms were performed in 50 consecutive Chinese patients seen at the pacemaker clinic. There were 25 women and 25 men. The mean age was sixty-six years (range thirty-two to eighty-one). The indications for pacing were complete heart block in 16 patients and sick sinus syndrome in the remainder. All pacemakers were of the single-chamber ventricular pacing type and had been implanted for a mean period of four years (range two to seven). In 27 patients the route of entry for the pacing electrode was through the cephalic vein and in the other 23 patients the subclavian veins were used. Of the 50 venograms, 1 showed partial and 1 showed total obstruction at the subclavian vein. Both patients (4%) were asymptomatic. All others (96%) were normal. The incidence of venous thrombosis was not related to the routes of entry of the pacing electrodes. All patients tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. It is concluded that the incidence of venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing is extremely low in the Chinese (4%), and venograms are both safe and useful for identifying venous thrombosis related to transvenous pacing. 
The 10-y incidence of obesity and major weight gain in black and white US women aged 30-55 y. Although the prevalence of obesity in US women is well-described, data are limited on the incidence of major weight gain and obesity. We used data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study to estimate the 10-y incidence of major weight gain (greater than or equal to 10 kg) and obesity [body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) greater than or equal to 29] in a cohort of US women aged 30-55 y (n = 535 blacks and 2976 whites). In women not obese at baseline, blacks were 60% more likely to become obese than whites [incidence in blacks = 15.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.2-19.7; incidence in whites = 9.7%, 95% CI = 8.6-10.8]. This higher incidence of obesity in blacks was largely due to their higher average BMI at baseline. The incidence of major weight gain was 50% higher in blacks than in whites (in blacks, 17.3%; 95% CI = 13.6-21.0; in whites, 11.7%; 95% CI = 10.3-13.1). We estimate that in black and white women, respectively, 16% and 12% of coronary heart disease is attributed to major weight gain whereas 35% and 21% is attributed to being obese. 
Development of the pulmonary vasculature in newborn lambs: structure-function relationships. Our objectives were 1) to describe the quantitative light microscopy and ultrastructure of newborn lamb lungs and 2) to correlate hemodynamic changes during normoxia and hypoxia with the morphology. By light microscopy, we measured the percent muscle thickness (%MT) and peripheral muscularization of pulmonary arteries and veins from 25 lambs aged less than 24 h, 2-4 days, 2 wk, and 1 mo. At the same ages, lungs were isolated and perfused in situ and, after cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin, total, arterial (delta Pa), middle (delta Pm), and venous pressure gradients at inspired O2 fractions of 0.28 (mild hyperoxia) and 0.04 (hypoxia) were determined with inflow-outflow occlusion. During mild hyperoxia, delta Pa and delta Pm fell significantly between 2-4 days and 2 wk, whereas during hypoxia, only delta Pm fell. The %MT of all arteries (less than 50 to greater than 1,000 microns diam) decreased, and peripheral muscularization of less than 100-microns-diam arteries fell between less than 4 days and greater than 2 wk. Our data suggest that 1) the %MT of arteries determines normoxic pulmonary vascular resistance, because only arterial and middle segment resistance fell, 2) peripheral muscularization is a major determinant of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, because we observed a fall with age in peripheral muscularization of less than 100-micron-diam arteries and in delta Pm with hypoxia, and 3) the arterial limit of the middle segment defined by inflow-outflow occlusion lies in 100- to 1,000-microns-diam arteries. 
IgA antigliadin antibodies, cellobiose/mannitol sugar test, and carotenemia in the diagnosis of and screening for celiac disease. Serum IgA antigliadin antibodies (IgAAGA) assay, cellobiose/mannitol sugar permeability test (ST), and carotenemia were evaluated prospectively as diagnostic tests in 60 consecutive adult patients with suspected celiac disease (CD). CD was confirmed histologically in 26 patients. IgAAGA, ST, and carotenemia had a sensitivity of 65.4%, 96.2%, and 76.9%, a specificity of 97.1%, 73.5%, and 70.6%, and positive likelihood ratio of 22.2, 3.6, and 2.6, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that IgAAGA and ST had a sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 70.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 47.3 if both were positive. Assuming a prevalence of CD of 1:2000 in the general population, for every 89 positive IgAAGA and 549 altered ST there would be one celiac patient, whereas, if both tests were positive, the patient was certain to have CD. We conclude that, of the tests studied, IgAAGA and ST are respectively the most specific and the most sensitive and that, used together, they can diagnose CD. 
Conjunctival cysts in anophthalmic orbits. Five out of 149 patients (3%) who received an intraorbital implant to prevent or treat the disfiguring symptoms associated with the postenucleation socket syndrome developed intraorbital conjunctival cysts. All five patients had received a secondary implant two 14 months previously. After excision of the cysts four patients required additional surgery for lack of conjunctiva and/or recurrent cyst formation. The clinical findings, mechanism of development, and management of this rare but serious complication of socket surgery are described. 
GM1-gangliosidosis (genetic beta-galactosidase deficiency): identification of four mutations in different clinical phenotypes among Japanese patients. GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene. While its phenotypic expression is complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and severity of central nervous system involvement. We have analyzed the acid beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families. The aim was to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes. Northern blotting studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients. Four distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective clinical forms within our small-size samples. In the infantile patient with decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in Arg49----Cys. In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation Arg457----Ter was identified. The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the point mutation Ile51----Thr. The mutations found in the juvenile and adult patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to quick screening. The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system. 
Biocompatibility of radiolucent breast implants. Current implants for breast augmentation containing silicone gel, saline, or both are radiopaque on mammographic examination and can totally obscure microcalcifications and soft-tissue masses. The effect of these implants on the detection of early breast cancers in patients who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty remains unproven and controversial. Implants filled with medium-chain triglycerides (peanut oil) are radiolucent on mammographic examination and allow visualization of both soft-tissue masses and microcalcifications. To investigate the biocompatibility of radiolucent implants, 10 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil was injected subcutaneously into rats using silicone gel as a control. Twenty-one rabbits had two 125-cc silicone shell implants inserted on either side of the chest wall. The right-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile saline, and the left-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil. Results were determined by both histologic and radiographic examination. Rats injected with peanut oil equivalent to 7 percent of their body weight rapidly absorbed the freely injected oil without detriment. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and tissues adjacent to the injection sites demonstrated no abnormalities. There was no evidence of allergic, toxic, inflammatory, or neoplastic response. Eighteen of 21 rabbits survived more than 3 months. Radiographs showed the oil-filled implants to be radiolucent, whereas the saline-filled controls obscured the surrounding soft and bony tissues. Histologic examination demonstrated a fibrous capsule surrounding both types of implants. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, and kidneys showed no significant abnormalities. These and previous studies have shown peanut oil to be biocompatible when freely injected either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. This study demonstrates that a radiolucent, peanut oil-filled implant is biocompatible in animals and that further long-term studies for its use in humans are merited. 
Metabolic and destructive brain disorders in children: findings with localized proton MR spectroscopy. The diagnostic potential of volume-selective proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in vivo was evaluated in 20 children and young adults with various neurodegenerative brain disorders. All patients were examined with MR spectroscopy in conjunction with MR imaging of the brain on a whole-body imager at 1.5 T. Comparison of spectra in our patients with those of children with normal myelination (prominent signals from N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine/phosphocreatine, and choline) revealed a marked decrease of NAA in 12 of 17 patients with focal or generalized demyelination. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA signal intensity was markedly increased, but no choline signal was found. Increased signal intensity from lactate occurred in patients with Leigh disease, neuroaxonal dystrophy, Schilder disease, and Cockayne disease, which indicated a disturbed energy metabolism in the examined region. These results demonstrate that proton MR spectroscopy can be applied in a clinical environment to facilitate diagnosis of hereditary and acquired brain disorders in children. 
Longitudinal followup of patients with Meniere's disease. The etiology, pathophysiology, and natural history of Meniere's syndrome are poorly understood. The reported studies have had inadequate followup or insufficient numbers of patients to allow conclusions about the natural history. Our study group was 119 patients who had the classic symptom complex of episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the year 1970. After initial review of these charts, follow-up information was obtained by questionnaire, telephone interview, chart review, or repeat examination, when possible, both in 1983 and in 1988, for a total followup of 18 years. In the patients with followups of at least 14 years, vertiginous episodes had disappeared completely in 50% of patients and somewhat resolved in 28%; hearing was absent in 48% and worse in 21%. Surprisingly, 43% of patients underwent surgery at some point for control of vertigo. Bilateral disease was present initially in 13% and developed subsequently in 45% of patients. Other areas reviewed included the efficacy of long-term medical treatment, frequency and severity of vertiginous attacks, and contralateral ear symptoms. 
Increased intestinal permeability in endotoxic pigs. Mesenteric hypoperfusion as an etiologic factor. Infusing pigs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreases superior mesenteric artery blood flow (Qsma), suggesting that mesenteric hypoperfusion may be responsible for LPS-induced alterations in gut mucosal permeability. To test this hypothesis, we studied four groups of anesthetized swine. Group 1 animals (N = 6) were infused with LPS (250 micrograms/kg over 1 hour beginning at 60 minutes) and continuously resuscitated with Ringer's lactate (48 mL/kg per hour). In group 2 (N = 5), Qsma was decreased by 50% by means of a mechanical occluder to mimic the LPS-induced alterations in Qsma observed in group I. Group 3 (N = 5) was included to document our ability to detect ischemia/reperfusion-induced alterations in mucosal permeability; in these pigs, Qsma was decreased in steps to zero flow (at 150 to 210 minutes) and then perfusion was restored (at 210 to 270 minutes). Pigs in group 4 (N = 6) served as normal controls; these animals were resuscitated with Ringer's lactate at the same rate as in group 1 but were not infused with LPS. To assess mucosal permeability, we measured plasma-to-lumen clearances for two markers, chromium 51-labeled edetic acid monohydrate (EDTA) and urea. Loading and maintenance infusions of the markers were given intravenously, and a 20-cm isolated segment of small intestine was continuously perfused at 2 mL/min with Ringer's lactate at 37 degrees C. Results were expressed as the ratio of the clearances for the two probes (CEDTA/CUREA). In group 3, CEDTA/CUREA was 999% +/- 355% of baseline at 270 minutes. In group 1, CEDTA/CUREA was 572% +/- 235% of baseline at 270 minutes. In groups 2 and 4, however, CEDTA/CUREA did not change significantly from the baseline value over the duration of the study. These data suggest that increased mucosal permeability after LPS is due to factors other than (or in addition to) mesenteric hypoperfusion. 
Characteristics of patients resistant to antihypertensive drug therapy. In order to determine the features that characterize refractory hypertension (RH), patients aged less than 65 years in a hypertension clinic were screened. Thirty-six patients on triple drug therapy with a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or equal to 5 mmHg above an identified target pressure (90-100 mmHg), or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 170 mmHg for the last 6 months (greater than or equal to 3 measurements) underwent a thorough clinical investigation. The frequency of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in the RH patients was 30%. The non-RAS patients had a low occupational status, 76% being either manual workers or unskilled non-manual workers (reference group: 42%; P less than 0.01). They were more obese (body mass index (BMI) 28.8 vs. 25.8; P less than 0.01), and had a longer duration of hypertensive disease. RH patients had a higher prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (18 vs. 6%; P less than 0.05), and showed a higher prevalence of nervous complaints and mental distress (44% vs. 12%; P less than 0.001) and musculo-skeletal pain (39% vs. 7%: P less than 0.001). It is suggested that refractory hypertension should be investigated and treated bearing psychosocial factors in mind, concurrently with a screening for secondary hypertension. 
Transcanal infracochlear approach to the petrous apex. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have now made it possible to reliably differentiate cholesteatoma from cholesterol granuloma of the petrous apex. The treatment for cholesteatoma is complete surgical excision when possible, whereas cholesterol granuloma needs only adequate drainage for control. A new transcanal infracochlear approach for drainage of cholesterol granuloma involving the anterior petrous apex is described. Absolute measurements from 10 cadaveric temporal bones were obtained to determine the distances between the cochlea, jugular bulb, carotid artery, and facial nerve. In all specimens the petrous apex was entered without invading the cochlea, carotid, or jugular bulb. Advantages of this technique include a more direct route to the petrous apex, dependent drainage, and preservation of the normal hearing mechanism, including the tympanic membrane. Clinical indications for this technique include failure of other treatment approaches and a high jugular bulb obstructing an infralabyrinthine approach. Experience to date shows that patients experience little difficulty from the procedure. 
Insulin pulses less effective than continuous insulin in inhibiting PEPCK mRNA levels stimulated by cAMP and dexamethasone in perifused hepatoma cells. Hepatic glucose production is stimulated in vitro twice as effectively by pulsatile as by continuous glucagon, given equivalent time-averaged doses. Efficacy studies of pulsatile insulin have yielded conflicting results. In the rat hepatoma cell line H-4-II-E-C3, insulin rapidly (t1/2 15 min) inhibits transcription of the gene and lowers mRNA levels for the gluconeogenic enzyme. PEPCK via a receptor-mediated process. We attached H-4-II-E-C3 cells to Cytodex-3 microcarriers and used a perifusion column system to test whether pulsatile insulin is more or less effective than equivalent time-averaged doses of continuous insulin. PEPCK transcription was induced by inclusion of cAMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenyl-thio)-cAMP (0.1 mM) and dexamethasone (0.5 microM) in the perifusion medium. Three columns were exposed either to continuous, pulsatile, or no insulin. After 3 h, total nucleic acid was extracted, and mRNA(PEPCK) was measured with a sensitive-solution hybridization assay. Continuous insulin inhibited PEPCK expression in a dose-dependent fashion with EC50 1 x 10(-11) M. Equivalent time-averaged amounts of insulin delivered as pulses achieved significant inhibition but less effectively than continuous insulin. The apparent EC50 for pulsatile insulin increased from 2 x 10(-11) M to 5 x 10(-11) M as the oscillatory period was raised from 5 to 20 min, respectively. These observations suggest that insulin-mediated inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription is diminished by a pulsatile mode of administration in marked contrast to the pulse enhancement demonstrated for glucagon-mediated hepatic glucose production. 
The clinical utility of prostate-specific antigen and bone scintigraphy in prostate cancer follow-up. To assess the value of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer follow-up, we prospectively studied 107 consecutive patients with: (1) pathologically confirmed prostate cancer; (2) definitive prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy greater than or equal to 3 mo prior to bone scanning; and (3) one bone scan and serum PSA sampling within 3 mo of each other. The mean and range of patient follow-up since definitive therapy was 1.6 and 0.5-8 yr, respectively. Abnormal bone scans were correlated with pertinent radiographs. Of 107 bone scans, 16 demonstrated metastatic bone disease. A PSA value of less than or equal to 8 ng/ml excluded bone metastases with a predictive value of a negative test of 98.5%. Without radiographic correlation, abnormal bone scans rarely represented metastases if the PSA value was less than or equal to 8 ng/ml. In summary, serum PSA concentration determines the need for follow-up bone scanning and assists in scan interpretation in patients status post definitive therapy for prostate cancer. 
Inflammatory edema induced by interactions between IL-1 and the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator with a long duration of action. CGRP is widely distributed and is present in perivascular nerves of tissues that include skin and the synovium. In this study we have investigated the possibility that CGRP can modulate the inflammatory actions of the cytokine IL-1 by using an inflammatory model in rabbit skin. The intradermal injection of IL-1 (1.4 x 10(-14) mol/site) alone stimulated little edema formation. However, when IL-1 was injected with CGRP (10(-11) mol/site), a highly significant edema was observed, and neutrophil accumulation induced by IL-1 was potentiated. These results suggest that the action of IL-1 as a potent mediator of increased microvascular permeability is only observed when skin blood flow is increased in this model. This was confirmed by experiments in which PGE2 (3 x 10(-9) mol/site) at a dose with a similar duration of vasodilator action as CGRP (10(-11) mol/site) also potentiated edema induced by IL-1. Further experiments investigated the mechanism by which IL-1 increased microvascular permeability. Edema induced by IL-1 was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and the presence of circulating neutrophils. However, selective platelet-activating factor and histamine H1 antagonists had no inhibitory effect on this response. Thus it appears that when a microvascular bed is dilated by the long-lasting vasodilator CGRP, edema induced by IL-1 is clearly observed. These results highlight a potentially important synergistic interaction between cytokines and neuropeptides in inflammation. 
Propranolol compared with propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate for portal hypertension in cirrhosis. A randomized controlled study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn) given with propranolol reduces hepatic portal pressure more than does propranolol alone in patients with cirrhosis. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices entered and 42 completed the study. INTERVENTION: Twenty-one patients received oral propranolol at increasing doses until their resting heart rate was reduced by 25%, and 21 patients received oral propranolol (on the same schedule) plus oral Is-5-Mn, 40 mg twice a day. MEASUREMENTS: Hepatic vein pressure gradient, liver function, and splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics before and after 3 months of continuous therapy. MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased more (P less than 0.01) in patients given propranolol plus Is-5-Mn (19%, from 18.4 +/- 3.9 to 14.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.4 to -4.5 mm Hg) than in those given propranolol alone (10%, from 18.2 +/- 3.5 to 16.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; CI, -1.1 to -2.7 mm Hg). The hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased by more than 20% of the baseline value in 10% of patients receiving propranolol, but in 50% of patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0.02). There were statistically significant decreases in hepatic blood flow and the intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green after propranolol therapy, but not after combined therapy. The treatments caused similar reductions in azygos blood flow and cardiac output. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term combined administration of propranolol plus Is-5-Mn reduces portal pressure more than propranolol alone without adverse effects on hepatic perfusion and liver function. Whether this greater hemodynamic effect translates into better clinical efficacy should be determined in randomized controlled trials. 
Assessment of competency: the role of neurobehavioral deficits. We present a practical set of guidelines for assessing competency in patients with cognitive deficits due to neurologic disorders such as stroke, head injury, Alzheimer disease, and multi-infarct dementia. Our focus is the evaluation of cognitive processes underlying the ability to make competent decisions, with an emphasis on the identification of areas of preserved function that may be used to bypass intellectual deficits. The assessment of the cognitive processes underlying competency involves a series of steps designed to evaluate attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function. The examiner must first show that the patient has an adequate level of attention for participation in the further testing of specific cognitive functions; second, that the patient is able to comprehend relevant instructions, retain information long enough to evaluate it in relation to relevant recent and remote experiences, and express his or her wishes; and finally, that the patient has sufficiently intact judgment and awareness. The examiner must determine whether the patient's preserved cognitive abilities are sufficient for him or her to make an adequate judgment in relation to the specific question being asked. If cognitive function is found to be significantly impaired, the examiner should do a detailed assessment for the presence of compensatory abilities that can be used to bypass the deficits. For example, the examiner should assess whether patients who cannot speak are still able to express their wishes by pointing, using gesture, or even by drawing pictures. Unless such an assessment has been done, patients should not be considered incompetent. 
Entire ABL gene is joined with 5'-BCR in some patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemia. In four patients, the chromosome 9 breakpoint of the t(9; 22)(q34;q11) had occurred at different sites within an 8.25-kilobase (kb) region situated 5' of ABL exon 1B. Chromosome in situ hybridization and field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) studies showed that ABL exons 1A and 1B were present on the Ph chromosome. Yet this large fusion gene produced an mRNA conventional for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Splicing from BCR exon 3 to ABL exon 2 crossed more than 200 kb and deleted exons 1A and 1B. This breakpoint site may occur in about 10% of all CML patients. Three of our patients have pronounced thrombocytosis, and two had been diagnosed as having Ph-positive essential thrombocythemia. The platelet count of the other patient was not available. 
Value and limitations of secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene. Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk. 
Responsiveness to phenobarbital in an adult with Crigler-Najjar disease associated with neurological involvement and skin hyperextensibility. We present the case of a 23-yr-old man who had had since birth marked and sustained unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia and who had had several attacks of grand mal seizures. Analysis of serum bilirubin by diazoreactive methods showed serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin as high as 445 mumol/L that were not affected by phenobarbital administration. However, analysis of serum bile pigments by high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated marked decrease of unconjugated bilirubin after phenobarbital treatment (from 432.4 mumol/L to 291.0 mumol/L) associated with slight increase of bilirubin monoconjugates and disconjugates (from 0.25 mumol/L to 0.42 mumol/L). Furthermore, in the past few years the patient had exhibited striking skin hyperextensibility and diaphragm eventration. This case confirms that alkaline methanolysis-high-pressure liquid chromatography is the most reliable method for assessment of serum fraction bilirubin levels; that clinical parameters such as neurological signs do not unequivocally discriminate between type I and II Crigler-Najjar disease and that response to phenobarbital treatment remains the main diagnostic tool. 
Myocardial infarction in childhood: clinical analysis of 17 cases and medium term follow up of survivors. Between 1979 and 1989 17 patients aged two months to 12 years with acute myocardial infarction of any cause (other than after cardiac surgery) were seen at a children's hospital. Eight died from three days to three years after diagnosis (overall mortality 47%). The nine survivors, now aged 2-17 years, have been followed for one to 10 years (mean follow up five years) after infarction. The commonest causes of myocardial infarction in this series were anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (six patients (35%] and Kawasaki disease (five patients (27%]. The main symptoms of acute myocardial infarction were dyspnoea, vomiting, and difficulty feeding. Diagnosis was made in all patients by electrocardiography and confirmed by echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, or at operation. All survivors were symptom free with excellent exercise capacity. The left ventricular ejection fraction in survivors ranged from 21% to 66%, and only one child was on regular cardiac medications. There were no cases of late sudden death. Twenty four hour Holter monitoring performed on survivors was normal (seven) or showed minor abnormalities only (one), suggesting that serious arrhythmia is rare after paediatric myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction in children had a high early mortality; however, the incidence of serious arrhythmia was low in the survivors, who had a good exercise tolerance even when the left ventricular ejection fraction was low. 
Post stenotic aneurysm in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. In a retrospective review of 74 cases of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome collected over a 16 year period, 10 cases of aneurysm were found (13.5%). This represents an incidence of 26% of the 38 cases of popliteal aneurysm of any etiology seen during the same period of time. In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment. Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin. We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur. We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa. 
Polyneuropathy induced by m-tolyl methyl carbamate intoxication. A 55-year-old woman who attempted suicide by ingesting 200 ml of m-tolyl methyl carbamate (MTMC) is reported. She was comatose for 3 days and, upon recovery, had notable paraesthesia in her lower limbs and difficulty in walking. Neurological examination revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy revealed marked axonal degeneration with a moderate decrease of myelinated fibres. 
Pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery as a complication of an osteochondroma. A review of the literature and a case report. False aneurysm of the femoral artery was associated with a solitary osteochondroma of the femur in a 22-year-old man. An extensive review of the literature and the problems related to diagnosis revealed that the aneurysm was apparently unique. Contrary to previous reports, computed tomography and angiography did not establish the diagnosis. The physical findings were more informative. 
Mammographic and CT findings after breast reconstruction with a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap. This essay illustrates the radiologic appearance of the reconstructed breast and the abdominal wall after breast reconstruction with a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap. The findings are based on a retrospective study of 42 mammograms, 17 abdominal CT scans, and two CT scans each of the chest and pelvis of patients who underwent this procedure. 
Surgical management of severe aortic outflow obstruction in lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome: use of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis. Between December 1985 and April 1990, 50 infants with a variety of congenital cardiac lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent surgical relief of aortic outflow obstruction by creation of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis. The patients were grouped anatomically by ventriculoarterial alignment. Nineteen had normally aligned great arteries (group I); 25 had transposition of the great arteries, all with a univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology (group II); and 6 had a double-outlet right ventricle (group III). All patients had either aortic stenosis with atresia, subaortic stenosis or a restrictive ventricular septal defect. Sixteen had normal arch anatomy; 34 had arch anomalies consisting of arch hypoplasia (n = 17), coarctation (n = 11), interruption of the arch (n = 4) and complex arch anomalies (n = 2). Surgery was performed at a median age of 10 days (range 2 to 184). Of the 50 infants, 33 survived. No significant difference in early survival (30 days) was noted among the groups of varying ventriculoarterial alignment (68% group I, 72% group II, 83% group III) (p greater than 0.05). Overall actuarial survival was 63% at 18 months. Analysis of actuarial survival by arch anatomy, although not statistically significant, revealed a trend toward better survival at 18 months postoperatively in infants with normal arch anatomy (81%) than in infants with arch anomalies (54%). Of the 33 survivors, 26 have proceeded to the next surgical stage, including the Fontan procedure in 8, superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in 13 and biventricular repair in 5. 
Complete infarction of the eye complicating a choroidal malignant melanoma. Infarction of malignant melanoma of the choroid has been previously reported, but infarction of the whole eye in association with infarction of melanoma is a rare event that has not been previously described. We present such a case and discuss the possible pathogenesis. 
Sudden death in infants sleeping on polystyrene-filled cushions. BACKGROUND. Infants are at risk for both the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and accidental suffocation. On postmortem examination, however, it is difficult to distinguish one from the other without information from the scene of death. Healthy infants are assumed to be able to turn their heads and, if not otherwise restrained, to obtain fresh air. We assessed this assumption in an investigation of infant deaths that occurred during sleep on cushions filled with polystyrene beads. METHODS. We obtained data on 25 deaths from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also used mechanical and animal models to study physiologic aspects of ventilation relevant to these results, by simulating the effects on an infant of breathing into a cushion. We measured the effects of softness, malleability (molding of the cushion about an infant's head), airflow resistance, and rebreathing of expired gases. RESULTS. All 25 study infants were prone when found dead, and at least 88 percent were face down with nose and mouth obstructed by the cushion. SIDS was the diagnosis in 19 of the 23 infants who underwent autopsy. Our findings show, however, that the cushion would have limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the amount of rebreathing we estimated to have occurred in the infants was lethal in a rabbit model. CONCLUSIONS. Accidental suffocation by rebreathing was the most likely cause of death in most of the 25 infants studied. Consequently, there is a need to reassess the cause of death in the 28 to 52 percent of the victims of SIDS who are found with their faces straight down. Safety regulations setting standards for softness, malleability, and the potential for rebreathing are needed for infant bedding. 
Complications of tissue plasminogen activator therapy after vitrectomy for diabetes. Human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (25 micrograms) was injected into seven eyes of six patients who had developed massive fibrin deposition after vitrectomy surgery for diabetes. Six eyes had developed pupillary membranes and recurrence of tractional retinal detachment from fibrin membranes, and one eye had developed only a pupillary membrane. All pupillary membranes resolved within one hour of administration of tissue plasminogen activator, and five tractional retinal detachments resolved within 24 hours. All eyes developed evidence of intraocular bleeding after tissue plasminogen activator injection. Subsequently, six of seven eyes developed recurrence of fibrin accumulation and tractional retinal detachment. 
Diet and nutrition in ulcer disease. In this era of H2-inhibitors, the available evidence does not support the need to place peptic ulcer disease patients on restrictive diets. The major goal of diet is to avoid extreme elevations of gastric acid secretion and the direct irritation of gastric mucosa. In view of this, only slight modifications in the patient's usual diet are recommended. Table 1 depicts a sample menu for chronic peptic ulcer disease. Frequent milk ingestion as previously prescribed is not encouraged. This is owing to the transient buffering effect and significant gastric acid secretion effect of milk. The fat content of milk has no influence on these effects. Spices, in particular black pepper, red pepper, and chili powder, may produce dyspepsia. One study shows red chili powder to have no detrimental effect on duodenal ulcer healing. It has also been proposed that daily pepper ingestion may have a beneficial adaptive cytoprotective response. While still controversial and under evaluation, peptic ulcer patients should avoid any spice that causes discomfort, especially during exacerbation of peptic disease. Currently, studies indicate that it is prudent to avoid alcohol. This is especially true for the concentrated forms, such as 40% (80 proof) alcohol. Coffee should be avoided on the basis of its strong acid secretagogue property. Coffee can induce dyspepsia. Whether noncoffee caffeine-containing beverages (tea, soft drinks) induce peptic ulcer is unknown, but they are acid secretion stimulators. Decaffeinated coffee has an acid stimulating effect as well. It is reasonable to have peptic ulcer patients restrict decaffeinated coffee and all caffeine-containing beverages. There appears to be no evidence to restrict dietary fiber. Some fiber-containing foods may possess factors that are protective against ulcer disease. According to the Mayo Clinic Diet Manual, previously recommended small frequent feedings have not been shown to be more effective than three meals per day in the treatment of chronic peptic ulcer disease. This reference cites authorities advising against extra feedings because of increased acid secretion and unnecessary complication of eating patterns. However, some patients claim to be relieved of symptoms with more frequent feedings, especially during acute phases. Citric acid juices may induce reflux and cause discomfort in selective patients. Stomach distention with large quantities of food should be discouraged. Although there is now little role for dietary therapy, one should note that bland and ulcer diets probably are not detrimental to most persons if they are used for a short time and may have some psychological benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Risk factors for gastrointestinal ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [published erratum appears in J Fam Pract 1991 Jul;33(1):16] Thirteen million individuals in the United States take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) chronically for the relief of pain and inflammation caused by arthritis and related conditions. NSAIDs are valuable and in many cases essential to the management of arthritis pain. Long-term use of NSAIDs, however, can cause gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications. Factors such as older age (greater than or equal to 60 years), a history of peptic ulcer disease, concomitant corticosterid use, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and high dose or multiple NSAID therapy can increase the risk of GI damage and complications in the chronic NSAID user. Physician awareness of these risk factors is crucial so that the benefits and hazards of NSAID therapy in high-risk patients can be properly weighed. When the decision is made to prescribe NSAIDs, despite the presence of risk factors for NSAID-induced ulcers, patients should be closely monitored, and, in some cases, effective prophylaxis should be initiated. This is especially important since NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers can be asymptomatic, causing serious ulcer complications without warning. 
Nesidioblastosis: evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance. The risk of recurrence of nesidioblastosis is unclear. Thirty patients from 28 families were studied; the marriages were consanguineous in five families. The ratio of subsequent affected to unaffected siblings was similar to that of an autosomal recessive condition and the sex ratio was close to 1. 
Isolated serum-free perfused rat kidneys release immunoreactive erythropoietin in response to hypoxia. The renal glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo) interacts with erythrocytic progenitors to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation in the bone marrow. The renal O2-sensing mechanism in the control of the synthesis of Epo is still poorly understood. Therefore, the capacity of isolated rat kidneys to produce Epo during hypoxic and anemic perfusion was studied. The kidneys were perfused at a constant perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg with a substrate-enriched Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 60 g/liter BSA and freshly drawn human erythrocytes. Epo was measured by RIA. When the kidneys were perfused at an arterial pO2 of 720 or 150 mm Hg (hematocrit, 5%), Epo production was very low (0.1-0.2 U/g kidney within 3 h of perfusion). When the arterial pO2 was lowered to 35 or 20 mm Hg, Epo production increased to 0.4 and 0.9 U/g kidney, respectively. The release of Epo during hypoxic perfusion (pO2 35 and 20 mm Hg) was little affected by changes in the hematocrit, i.e. the O2-carrying capacity of the perfusion medium over a wide range (0-40%). These results indicate that the production of Epo in the isolated perfused kidney depends on the availability of O2 and can be modulated by changes in the arterial pO2. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for secondary prevention of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Asymptomatic men (N = 114) 50 years of age or older had screening for colorectal neoplasia with flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy regardless of the sigmoidoscopic result. Our study objective was to determine the prevalence of patients having isolated adenomatous polyps in a proximal colonic segment in the absence of a distal index neoplasm within reach of the sigmoidoscope. Through the combined use of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, adenomatous polyps were detected in 47 of 114 individuals (41%). A total of 88 adenomas was found. Seventeen patients had isolated neoplasms in proximal colonic segments in the absence of distal adenomas. These patients represented 15% of screened subjects (17 of 114) and 20% of individuals who lacked adenomas on sigmoidoscopy (17 of 84). The majority of proximal neoplasms were small (less than 1.0 cm), tubular adenomas. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for screening asymptomatic men for neoplasia. However, it remains to be determined if a 20% miss rate (for those with a normal sigmoidoscopic examination) is significant and whether small proximal adenomas are worth finding. 
Temporal thresholds for neocortical infarction in rats subjected to reversible focal cerebral ischemia. We investigated the temporal threshold for focal cerebral infarction in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The right middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery were occluded for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 24 hours, and all the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Cortical infarct volumes and edema volumes were quantified in serial frozen sections of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue using image analysis. Upon occlusion, blood flow in the core of the ischemic zone, measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, fell to a mean +/- standard deviation of 21 +/- 7% of the preocclusion baseline value (n = 26). During the first hour of ischemia, blood flow in the densely ischemic zone rose to 27 +/- 8% of baseline (n = 25). Release of the middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery occlusions rapidly restored cortical blood flow to 213 +/- 83% of baseline (n = 21). Focal ischemia of 1 hour's duration caused little or no infarction, while ischemic intervals of 2 and 3 hours produced successively larger volumes of infarcted cortex. Ischemic intervals of 3-4 hours' duration followed by approximately 20 hours of recirculation yielded infarct volumes that were not significantly different from those after 24 hours of permanent focal ischemia. The results indicate that 3-4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia in this rat model is sufficient to attain maximal infarction and suggest that recirculation or pharmacological interventions after this time will provide little benefit. 
Air esophagogram and intestinal pseudoocclusion in a patient with scleroderma. Air in the esophagus is unusual because it is collapsible. Its finding on a chest roentgenogram, particularly when not associated with a fluid level indicative of stricture, should strongly suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We describe a patient with scleroderma with intestinal pseudoocclusion and an air esophagogram. Study of chest roentgenograms of 83 patients with scleroderma, including those of 7 with pseudoocclusion, revealed no other instance of air esophagogram. This radiological sign, although rare, should suggest scleroderma and may be particularly useful in patients with "systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.". 
Local anesthesia blocks the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture. The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia. Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes at the time of administration of premedication. In random order the site of the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients. Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline solution. This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia. 
Immunolocalization of the Bcl-2 protein within hematopoietic neoplasms. The Bcl-2 proto-oncogene was discovered at the t(14;18) breakpoint found in most follicular B-cell lymphomas and some diffuse large-cell lymphomas. Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and extending cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in 82 hematologic malignancies and reactive lymphoid processes. All lymphomas with Bcl-2 rearrangement demonstrated high levels of Bcl-2 protein. However, most follicular and diffuse lymphomas without Bcl-2 rearrangement also displayed intense Bcl-2 staining. In these cases, mechanisms other than classic translocation may be deregulation Bcl-2. The pattern of Bcl-2 staining in follicular lymphoma is the inverse of the pattern in reactive hyperplasia, confirming a role for Bcl-2 immunolocalization in routine diagnosis. Small lymphocytic malignancies, including small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressed intermediate levels of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias. Bcl-2 protein levels in T-cell lymphomas reflected their corresponding stage of development. No substantial Bcl-2 was present in the Reed-Sternberg cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was strongly positive for Bcl-2, consistent with the presence of Bcl-2 in normal myeloid progenitors. Immunohistochemistry identified an expanded spectrum of hematopoietic neoplasms in which Bcl-2 may provide a cell survival advantage. 
Intestinal lymphonodular hyperplasia of childhood: patterns of presentation. In this retrospective analysis we searched for a constellation of signs or symptoms attributable to childhood lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH). Of 147 children with documented LNH reviewed, 43% had lesions in the small bowel, and 57% in the large bowel. Children in this study presented with complaints of abdominal pain (58%) and bright red blood per rectum (32%). Physical examination revealed little except right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal tenderness and "fullness" in 35%. The pain was periumbilical, dull-cramping, rarely acute, and nonradiating. The hematochezia was most commonly streaky red in mucoid strands adhering to the stools, with no associated tenesmus. Three clinical patterns emerged: (a) Under 1 year of age most patients were male, with painless bleeding and pancolonic LNH. (b) Between 2 and 6 years, although the LNH was predominantly colonic, pain and bleeding occurred equally. (c) From 7 years old on, the main symptom was abdominal pain, but LNH distribution was nearly equal between the small bowel and the colon. To date, our long-term follow-up of the children with isolated LNH has revealed no sequelae. 
Gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions. A histologic and immunohistochemical study of 23 cases. A histologic and immunohistochemical study was carried out in 23 unselected nonantral gastric carcinoids and their precursor lesions classified according to Solcia et al. None of the patients showed Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Two variants of carcinoids showing distinctive pathologic and pathogenetic characteristics were identified on the basis of presence or absence of associated chronic atrophic gastritis type A (A-CAG). Chronic atrophic gastritis type A was found in 19 cases showing either single or multiple neoplasms, tumor extension limited to the mucosa or submucosa, consistent endocrine cell precursor changes in extratumoral mucosa, and consistent hypergastrinemia and/or G cell hyperplasia. Associated precursor lesions were only hyperplastic in all but two cases with single carcinoids whereas they were also dysplastic in all but one case with multiple carcinoids. The four tumors arising in nonatrophic mucosa were all single, more aggressive, and not associated with extratumoral endocrine cell proliferations or with signs of gastrin hypersecretion. Tumor cells were diffusely immunoreactive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin B or HISL-19. Scattered serotonin cells were found in ten carcinoids. They were more frequent in infiltrating than in intramucosal tumors as were the less represented pancreatic polypeptide cells whereas the reverse was found for alpha-subunit-containing cells. These results are of relevance for tumor pathogenesis and may provide the rationale for a less aggressive therapeutic approach in the patients. 
Facial dystonia, essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Movement disorders, or dyskinesias, in the facial region may be categorized in several ways. Dystonic movement disorders in the cranial-cervical region, including essential blepharospasm, Meige syndrome and spasmodic torticollis, are characterized by uncontrollable squeezing movements in the face and neck. These disorders typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Essential blepharospasm is particularly debilitating, as the involuntary eyelid closure that accompanies this condition may result in functional blindness with an otherwise normal visual pathway. Hemifacial spasm is an intermittent, unilateral, spasmodic contraction of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. This disorder usually presents in the third or fourth decade and has a different underlying pathophysiology than the dystonias. Botulinum A toxin therapy has largely supplanted surgical intervention in the treatment of essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with negative results. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine has been reported to induce beneficial effects in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Because cholestasis of pregnancy has a high prevalence in Chile and a deleterious effect on fetal prognosis, we decided to verify the efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in this disease. Eighteen patients with pruritus that appeared during pregnancy and with elevated serum levels of bile salts (68.1 +/- 15.9 mumol/L; mean +/- S.E.M.) and ALT (226 +/- 50 KU/L) were enrolled in a prospective double-blind study comparing the effects of the drug with a placebo. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine, 900 mg, or placebo was administered in daily intravenous infusions for 20 days. Every 5 days liver function tests were done and pruritus was assessed using a preestablished score. No significant differences in pruritus or in serum levels of bile salts, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatases were seen during or after treatment between patients who received S-adenosyl-L-methionine (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9). No relevant adverse reactions were detected. Most patients had cesarean sections because of reasons unrelated to the therapeutic trial. All newborns had Apgar scores greater than 7 and normal postnatal development. Our patients had moderately severe to severe cholestasis of pregnancy as indicated by the onset of pruritus before wk 32 of pregnancy. Seven of nine multiparous patients had a past history of recurrent cholestasis of pregnancy. In this study, the administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine during 20 days did not improve intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. 
Fabry disease: detection of 13-bp deletion in alpha-galactosidase A gene and its application to gene diagnosis of heterozygotes. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed messenger RNA from a patient with Fabry disease revealed a 13-base pair deletion in the 5' region (exon 1) of alpha-galactosidase A complementary DNA. This gene rearrangement was not detected by Southern or Northern analysis. Short direct repeats were present around the breakpoints, and considered to be of pathogenetic significance. Gene diagnosis of the mother and a female cousin was successfully achieved by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA; the former as a Fabry disease heterozygote and the latter as a normal homozygote. 
Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. 
Urinary pepsinogen I as a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. The possibility that urinary pepsinogen I is a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy was examined. To decide the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen I after total gastrectomy, urine samples from 15 patients who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer in the early or advanced stages and had been free from recurrence for more than 5 years were examined by pepsinogen I-specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of urinary pepsinogen I was 17.5 +/- 7.4 ng/ml and the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen after total gastrectomy was set at 32 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD). Twenty-two of 74 cases who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer were regarded as positive. And 20 of these 22 positive cases had definite clinical signs of recurrence of stomach cancer. There were only two false-positive cases. These results suggest that urinary pepsinogen I will be an useful tumor marker in detecting the recurrence of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. 
Acute postinfarction septal rupture: long-term results. From 1973 to 1989, 66 patients received early surgical repair for acute postinfarction ventricular septal rupture. Mean age was 64 +/- 7 years (range, 45 to 80 years). Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction. Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%). Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28. Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment. The same technique was used in all cases. Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5. The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years. Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%). No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation. Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10). Response to initial active therapy has a strong predictive value (mortality of 70% in unresponsive patients versus 14% in responders; p less than 0.001). 
Endothelial modulation of vascular tone: relevance to coronary angioplasty and restenosis. The vascular endothelium importantly modulates many biochemical and physiologic properties of the vascular wall, including the release of potent vasoactive factors, maintenance of an anticoagulant state and modulation of vascular growth by the release of both proliferative and antiproliferative substances. Prominent among these endothelial roles is the production of a potent vasodilator or family of vasodilators termed the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, one of which has been identified to be nitric oxide or a closely related compound. Several diseases that commonly occur in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty alter many facets of endothelial function and may predispose to adverse clinical sequelae of angioplasty, including immediate thrombosis, restenosis and vascular spasm. Several features of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, how it is altered by pathologic processes and how these considerations relate to the immediate and late postangioplasty periods are discussed. 
Iontophoresis versus subcutaneous injection: a comparison of two methods of local anesthesia delivery in children. The relative efficacy of local lidocaine anesthesia administered by subcutaneous injection and by iontophoresis was studied in 13 pediatric renal dialysis patients (ages 11-19 years: mean age 15.8 years). Each patient served as his own control at 3 assessment periods. Each type of anesthetic delivery method was administered to either of 2 fistula sites. Patients used visual analogue scales to rate pain, anxiety, and satisfaction for each method. Behavioral observations were made by an observer and a nurse. Paired sample t tests were used to compare the 2 drug delivery methods for patient, observer, and nurse ratings across assessment periods. There were no significant differences between methods for ratings of anxiety before or during the procedure. The injection of lidocaine was rated as more painful by the observer and nurse (with a trend for patients) than the use of iontophoresis. But, the patients and nurse rated the injection method as more effective. Iontophoresis was never rated as superior to the injection method, even after turning over control of drug delivery by iontophoresis to the patient (sessions 2 and 3). Patients were more satisfied with iontophoresis at session 2 when they took over control, but lost enthusiasm by session 3. Three subjects withdrew from the study due to cutaneous burns and prolonged anesthesia delivery time with iontophoresis. Iontophoresis appears to be effective in reducing the pain of dialysis needle insertion but requires further investigation before it can be considered a viable alternative to subcutaneous injection. 
Thrombocytosis in adults: analysis of 777 patients. A total of 777 patients with thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count of greater than 500 x 10(9)l-1, seen in a University hospital over a 1-year period, were studied prospectively for aetiology. The most frequent causes of thrombocytosis were infection (21.9%), rebound thrombocytosis (19.4%), tissue damage (17.9%), chronic inflammatory disorders (13.1%) and malignancy (5.9%). Thrombocytosis associated with multiple causative factors, occurring simultaneously, was seen in 6.1% of cases. Thrombocytosis of greater than or equal to 1 million x 10(9)l-1 was found most frequently in patients with multiple aetiological factors occurring at the same time, in myeloproliferative disorders, or in postsplenectomy patients. 
Late recovery of function after oculomotor nerve palsy. We studied three patients who developed oculomotor nerve paresis from different causes. Each patient improved somewhat over several months, after which there was no further improvement for at least six months. Although the pareses were thought to be stable after the period of no improvement, each patient subsequently had further improvement in both motility and alignment with resolution of diplopia in primary position and in more than one of the cardinal positions of gaze. Patients with oculomotor nerve paresis may improve further after an initial period of improvement followed by several months of stability. 
Maintenance therapy in peptic ulcer disease. The maxim "once an ulcer, always an ulcer" is still an appropriate description for the chronic nature of peptic ulcer disease. The goals for treating patients with ulcer disease are to relieve symptoms, heal the acute ulcer, reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications, and decrease the economic impact of this chronic disease while maintaining the patient's quality of life. Patients with documented peptic ulcer disease should be carefully evaluated and a treatment plan devised that takes into account the possible need for maintenance therapy. Risk factors that seem to reflect a high likelihood of ulcer recurrence should be identified early in all ulcer patients and attempts made to minimize or correct them in the future. Assuming that a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease has been firmly established and an adequate period of drug treatment makes complete ulcer healing likely, a reasonable way to proceed is outlined in Figure 4. If the patient is young and generally healthy, has an uncomplicated ulcer and few risk factors favoring ulcer relapse, either no treatment or symptomatic selfcare would be reasonable. If one chooses the latter course, the patient can be given a prescription for 3 to 6 months of medication and told to take full therapy for any recurrent symptoms, continuing the treatment until symptoms are relieved. The failure of such treatment to relieve symptoms after 2 to 3 weeks, the onset of alarming symptoms such as intense pain, vomiting, or melena, or possibly the exhaustion of the 6-month supply of medication with continued mild symptoms should lead to reevaluation. Alternatively, such a patient could be managed with no therapy and seen again if ulcer symptoms recur and reevaluated for further diagnosis and treatment. Obviously, patients who are candidates for these approaches to postulcer healing management are those with a low risk for ulcer recurrence and who are likely to be compliant with follow-up advice. Accordingly, careful patient selection seems most important in prescribing symptomatic self-care or intermittent full-dose maintenance treatment. On the other hand, if the patient has had a complicated course of ulcer disease, such as bleeding, or has a significant number of risk factors that would make early ulcer relapse highly likely, it would be prudent to institute continuous maintenance therapy while working to reduce or eliminate the adverse risk factors. Any relapse of symptomatic ulcer disease during noncontinuous maintenance therapy should indicate the need for return to a continuous dosing program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor sensitizes rabbits to endotoxin-induced intravascular coagulation and the generalized Shwartzman reaction. We have reported earlier that immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) sensitizes rabbits to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by infusing a low concentration of tissue factor (TF). We now describe the effect of immunodepletion of EPI in rabbits administered endotoxin. Cortisone-treated rabbits were administered anti-rabbit EPI immunoglobulin (IgG) or Fab fragments or were administered control nonimmune material before an injection of endotoxin. In four of seven rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI activity levels were reduced by 70% to 80% of initial levels for 6 to 8 hours. In these rabbits the endotoxin induced extensive DIC, as evidenced by substantial decreases in fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and platelets, and gross hemorrhagic necrosis of the kidneys due to massive deposition of fibrin in the glomerular microcirculation (the generalized Shwartzman reaction). In three rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI levels were only transiently reduced. In these rabbits and in four rabbits administered nonimmune IgG or Fab, endotoxin induced minimal to moderate intravascular clotting and deposits of fibrin were not found in the glomerular capillaries. Because it is believed that TF expressed on monocytes triggers endotoxin-induced coagulation, these data are taken as evidence that EPI functions as a natural anticoagulant that can regulate factor VIIa/TF activity expressed on cell surfaces in vivo. They support a hypothesis that EPI prevents thrombotic complications that might otherwise result from exposure of blood to cytokine-induced generation of small amounts of TF on cell surfaces in many inflammatory and infectious disease states. 
Testicular plasmacytoma. A case report with immunohistochemical studies and literature review. Plasmacytomas of the testes are extremely rare tumors, especially when occurring in the absence of a previous or concurrent diagnosis of multiple myeloma. We present a case of solitary testicular plasmacytoma in a 71-year-old man who had no clinical evidence of myeloma. Immunohistochemical stains showed monoclonal cytoplasmic production of IgA-kappa within tumor cells. A summary of the other reported cases of testicular plasmacytoma is presented. Plasmacytoma of the testes, while occasionally manifesting as a solitary, primary lesion, most likely is a precocious, highly unusual manifestation of systemic multiple myeloma. 
The effect of prostacyclin on intracranial pressure in patients with acute hepatic and renal failure. Prostacyclin was administered on 20 occasions to 12 patients with fulminant hepatic failure complicated by acute renal failure prior to commencing dialysis at a dose of 5 ng/kg.min. Intracranial pressure was noted to increase during the infusion from a median of 12 mmHg (95% confidence limits 9-14) to 17 mmHg (12-25), p less than 0.01, at the same time the mean arterial blood pressure declined from 79 mmHg (65-82) to 64 (56-70), p less than 0.01, and the cerebral perfusion pressure from 62 mmHg (53-67) to 44 mmHg (41-55), p less than 0.01. The changes were greater for those patients who subsequently died from cerebral edema. Patients with fulminant hepatic and acute renal failure are at risk of dying from cerebral edema. The direct administration of prostacyclin, used for extracorporeal anticoagulation, may cause a further increase in intracranial pressure and reduce cerebral perfusion, thus resulting in patient morbidity and mortality. 
Combined thoracic aortic dissection and abdominal aortic fusiform aneurysm. Certain clinical and autopsy findings are described in 13 patients who had both aortic dissection (AD) and fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). All 13 patients had severe and extensive aortic atherosclerosis. The AAA was diagnosed clinically in 9 patients, and 5 had the AAA resected. The AD was diagnosed clinically in 5 patients, and 2 underwent attempted operative repair. Two patients who had the AAA resected because of suspected rupture were found later to have ruptured a more proximal AD. Thus, AD occurs occasionally in patients who have AAA. In older persons with suspected rupture of an AAA, a more proximal rupture of an AD should be ruled out. When both AAA and AD are present in the same patient, the AD is more likely the cause of cardiovascular collapse than is rupture of the AAA. 
Enterocutaneous fistulas following laparotomy for trauma. Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF) are recognized complications of various bowel diseases. Trauma is reported as a rare cause of ECF. ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury was studied in 15 patients to determine whether traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in posttraumatic ECF. Thirty-three per cent of patients with posttraumatic ECF spontaneously healed fistulas with appropriate nutritional support without operative intervention. Sixty-six per cent of patients required operative intervention, either because of associated sepsis or failure to spontaneously heal. Five patients had fistulas originate from areas of bowel not injured in the initial injury. This study suggests traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury and result in a spontaneous closure of fistulas in one-third of patients. In addition, sepsis is the main indication for early aggressive operative treatment of these fistulas. 
Stroke prevention in women: role of aspirin versus ticlopidine. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in North America. Most studies indicate that women are just as likely as men to have an initial stroke but less likely to have a recurrent stroke. Aspirin and ticlopidine are two antiplatelet drugs that reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25% to 30%. In some stroke prevention trials, aspirin has been shown to be more effective for men than for women. In contrast, major stroke prevention trials using ticlopidine have demonstrated equal benefit in women and in men. The overall incidence of adverse effects seen with ticlopidine is not significantly different from that observed with aspirin. There are now two effective agents useful in stroke prevention in both men and women. 
Neutrophil accumulation in ischemic canine myocardium. Insights into time course, distribution, and mechanism of localization during early reperfusion. BACKGROUND. We have previously demonstrated that chemotactic factors released from the ischemic canine myocardium peak early during reperfusion and that they elicit neutrophil adherence reactions in vitro that are dependent on the CD18 glycoprotein family. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that neutrophil localization in ischemic canine myocardium in vivo occurs over a similar time course during early reperfusion and involves a CD18-dependent mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We occluded the circumflex coronary artery for 1 hour in acute, open-chest dogs, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined using radiolabeled microspheres, and localization was traced using technetium-99m-labeled autologous neutrophils. In the first hour of reperfusion, neutrophil localization occurred preferentially within the subendocardial region and was inversely related to flow. Neutrophil localization diminished across the ischemic myocardium from endocardium to epicardium but remained negatively related to flow in the midmyocardial region. Regardless of flow, little neutrophil localization occurred in the subepicardial region. Neutrophil localization was greatest in the first hour of reperfusion and diminished thereafter. By 4 hours of reperfusion, the rate of localization was markedly attenuated relative to 1 hour. Dogs given anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody R15.7 (1 mg/kg i.v.) before occlusion underwent 1 hour of occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. When compared with 1-hour reperfusion controls, the R15.7-treated dogs demonstrated significant attenuation of neutrophil localization in the subendocardial region. CONCLUSIONS. These data support the concepts that rapid neutrophil localization during reperfusion occurs within regions of previous myocardial ischemia and that neutrophils preferentially localize within the subendocardial region. The rate of neutrophil localization is greatest within the first hour after the initiation of reperfusion, and localization is, at least in part, CD18 dependent. Therapies directed against neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury should be initiated with these considerations in mind. 
Establishment and characterization of 20 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in a serum-free defined medium (ACL-4). To facilitate the studies in cell biology and drug sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer, cell samples from 55 patients have been used to establish cell lines in culture using a chemically defined medium (ACL-4). A total of 20 cell lines (36 percent) were directly established and characterized: 14 (44 percent) from pleural effusions, five (29 percent) from resected primary tumors, and one (25 percent) from ascitic fluids. They comprised 16 adenocarcinoma, two large cell carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one malignant mesothelioma. Each cell line had distinct gross morphologic features and population doubling times from 21 to 75 h. The plating efficiency was 0.01 to 9.51 percent. The modal chromosome number varied from 45 to 108. Secretion of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl Lewis Xi, CA 50, CA 125, and CA 19-9) into the medium was also different in each cell line. Most of the cell lines have been xenografted into nude mice and found to be tumorigenic. Survival of 20 patients whose tumor cell specimens continually grew in culture at any time during their clinical course was significantly shorter than that of 35 patients with no in vitro tumour growth (median survival time of 28 weeks vs 53 weeks, p = 0.0093). Our study indicates that in vitro tumor cell growth appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
Treatment of refractory peptic ulcer with omeprazole or continued H2 receptor antagonists: a controlled clinical trial. We tested the hypothesis that the gastric H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, omeprazole, because of its different mode of action and pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion, may be more effective in peptic ulcer that is refractory to histamine H2 receptor antagonist treatment than continuing the same therapy. Altogether 107 patients (duodenal ulcer, n = 88; prepyloric ulcer, n = 14; gastric ulcer, n = 3; mixed sites, n = 2) with refractory peptic ulcer - that is ulcer unhealed after at least two months' treatment with cimetidine 0.8 g or 1 g daily or with ranitidine 0.3 g daily - were randomly allocated to receive either omeprazole 40 mg daily (n = 54) or to continue treatment with the same H2 receptor antagonist and at the same dose (n = 53) for up to eight weeks. The patients in the two treatment groups were well matched demographically. Healing by 'intent to treat' analysis was as follows: at four weeks, omeprazole 46 of 54 (85%), H2 receptor antagonist 18 of 53 (34%) (p less than 0.0001); and at eight weeks, 52 of 54 (96%) and 30 of 53 (57%) respectively (p less than 0.0001). One patient was lost to follow up but of the 22 patients whose ulcers were shown to be unhealed at endoscopy after receiving continued H2 receptor antagonist treatment, 21 healed in four to eight weeks when changed to omeprazole. 
Ras oncogene mutations in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Current models for tumorigenesis propose that a series of genetic alterations occur during the progression from the normal cell to the malignant phenotype. Mutations in each of the three ras genes (K-ras, H-ras, and N-ras) have been identified in many human neoplasms, including thyroid cancer. In this study we examined genomic DNA from benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms for mutations that are known to activate the ras oncogenes (codons 12, 13, and 61). DNA from frozen surgically excised tissue (n = 8) and from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (n = 30) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations using oligonucleotide-specific hybridization. No mutations were identified in follicular adenomas (n = 9). In follicular carcinomas, 2 of 14 tumors contained mutations (N-ras 61, Gln to Arg), and both of these patients had bone metastases. One of 15 papillary carcinomas had a ras mutation (H-ras 12, Gly to Ser). In contrast to other studies, we found that ras mutations are relatively uncommon in both benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Studies of larger numbers of tumors and comparisons of different patient populations will be required to assess a possible association of mutations in N-ras 61 with clinically aggressive follicular cancer. 
Pulsed-field electrophoresis screening for immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) multigene deletions and duplications. Genome regions containing multiple copies of homologous genes, such as the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) locus, are often unstable and give rise to duplicated and deleted haplotypes. Analysis of such processes is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of evolution of multigene families. In the IGHC region, a number of single and multiple gene deletions, derived from either unequal crossing-over or looping-out excision, have been described. To study these haplotypes at the population level, a simple and efficient method for preparing large numbers of DNA samples suitable for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was set up, and a sample of 110 blood donors was screened. Deletions were found to be frequent, as expected on the basis of previous serological surveys for homozygotes. Furthermore, a number of multigene duplications, never identified before, were detected. The total frequency of individuals bearing rearranged IGHC haplotypes was 10%. The genes involved in these deletions and duplications were assessed by densitometric analysis of standard Southern blots hybridized with several IGHC probes; two types of deletion and two types of duplication could thus be characterized. These data provide further evidence of the instability of the IGHC locus and demonstrate that unequal crossing-over is the most likely origin of rearranged IGHC haplotypes; they also suggest that such recombination events may be relatively frequent. Moreover, the simplicity and effectiveness of the large-scale PFGE screening approach will be of great help in the study of multigene families and of other loci involved in aberrant recombinations. 
Vasculitic skin ulcers associated with myelofibrosis--a case report. This is the case report of a seventy-seven-year-old woman with ulcerated skin vasculitis of the lower extremities that preceded the appearance of myelofibrosis. No previous report of this association has been found in a survey of the literature. 
White sponge naevus and ocular coloboma. White sponge naevus occurred in association with coloboma of the iris in six members of one family, across three generations. The association of these two dominantly inherited conditions has not to our knowledge previously been described. 
Posterior urethral valves presenting as venous obstruction. A patient with posterior urethral valves presented with unilateral lower leg ecchymosis and edema. He initially had significant renal function impairment. The ecchymosis and edema resolved after appropriate therapy, and his renal function returned to normal. 
Nicotine potentiation of haloperidol in reducing tic frequency in Tourette's disorder [published erratum appears in Am J Psychiatry 1991 Sep;148(9):1282] In an open, nonblind study, 10 patients with Tourette's disorder who were being treated with haloperidol were videotaped before, while, and after chewing nicotine gum. The frequency of tics was reduced significantly during the 30-minute gum-chewing period and during the 1 hour after gum chewing. Nicotine appears to potentiate haloperidol effects in patients with Tourette's disorder. 
Prophylaxis of stress ulcer bleeding. A meta-analysis. Recent studies have reported upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in 5-25% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe stress despite the use of antacids and/or H2-antagonists. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, a meta-analysis of all prospective studies on the prevention of stress bleeding, available from the international literature, was conducted. Only macroscopically visible bleeds were considered. Because alkalinization of the gastric juice has been incriminated in facilitating gastric and pulmonary colonization, agents with little or no influence on the gastric pH have been increasingly investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. The meta-analysis was therefore extended to determine the efficacy of two newer substances, pirenzepine and sucralfate, in preventing macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as their influence on pulmonary infections and mortality. Antacids and H2-antagonists proved to be significantly superior to untreated controls, with the tendency in favor of antacids administered in short intervals as compared to H2-antagonists. Pirenzepine and sucralfate were significantly superior to H2-antagonists, and sucralfate was as effective as an adequate antacid regimen. Patient groups treated with antacids or H2-antagonists showed a significantly higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. The most significant differences was found in long-term ventilated patients compared with patients treated with sucralfate. In the same patient group, antacids and H2-antagonists also showed a significantly higher mortality rate than sucralfate. 
The significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. 
Macrophage apolipoprotein synthesis and endoneurial distribution as a response to segmental demyelination. The synthesis and endoneurial distribution of apolipoproteins in response to myelin degradation was elucidated morphologically and biochemically in rodent models of segmental demyelination. At the onset of acute demyelination induced by tellurium (Te) poisoning, macrophages infiltrated the endoneurium and then began to express cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for apolipoprotein E (apo E). When demyelinating nerve slices were incubated with S35-methionine, radiolabeled apo E was released, showing that apo E was actively synthesized by the macrophages. Macrophages secreted apo E into the endoneurial spaces, leading to dense endoneurial accumulations. Other apolipoproteins (apo A1 and albumin) were not synthesized in the endoneurium, but they entered edematous nerves, presumably through an early breakdown in the blood-nerve barrier. During the phagocytosis of myelin, plasma-derived apolipoproteins accumulated within some of the macrophages. In chronic demyelination caused by lead poisoning, the cellular and extracellular distribution of apolipoproteins was similar to Te neuropathy; the amount of apo E accumulation and the macrophage density were proportional to the prevalence of active demyelination in teased fibers. Similar patterns of endoneurial apo E were present in an inherited form of demyelination in the twitcher mouse, after antibody-mediated demyelination, and in demyelination secondary to axonal degeneration. Human sural nerve biopsies had patterns of apolipoprotein E antigenicity that were comparable to the rodent models. We conclude that secretion of apo E by infiltrating macrophages is a generalized response to demyelination, and that endoneurial edema leads to the accumulation of certain plasma apolipoproteins within macrophages. These data suggest that endoneurial apolipoproteins and macrophages might mediate important functions in patients recovering from primary and secondary demyelination. 
Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. The association of congenital ablepharon with the absence of eyelashes and eyebrows, a wide mouth (macrostomia), and auricular, nasal, genital, and other systemic anomalies has been termed the ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. One such case is reported which illustrates the importance of immediate postnatal ocular management to minimise severe visual loss. 
Daily chronic headache. Headache is a disabling condition, and medical science has not, until recently, begun to address it in a fashion consistent with its widespread impact. Despite the limitations in our current understanding, as well as the historical prejudice directed toward patients with this condition, current understanding and treatment approaches can provide hope and relief for most patients who have these disorders. 
Bilateral retinal hamartomas in neurofibromatosis type 2. We report a case of bilateral retinal hamartomas in a child with neurofibromatosis type 2. This unique case demonstrates that a diversity of retinal changes can occur in this disease. 
Prevalence and severity of morbidity among Gujarati Asian elders: a controlled comparison. Asian elders make relatively heavy use of health services: this may be due to higher levels of morbidity, but controlled comparisons have not been carried out. A comparison of the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases and use of health services of Asian and indigenous elders was made. A sample of 59 Gujarati Asians of mean age 62.9 years and 59 indigenous subjects of mean age 63.9 years of whom 42% (25 in each group) were female drawn from a general practice was studied. Asian subjects had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diseases, with the exception of chronic obstructive airways disease, but lower risk of falls and urinary incontinence. Asian subjects had higher life satisfaction scores and lower prevalence of depressed mood. Asian women were more likely to have had contact with primary care services. Both Asian men and women had more frequent hospital admissions, but similar levels of out-patient attendance. Body mass index, blood pressure and shoulder joint range of movement were similar for both Asians and the indigenous population. Asian subjects had significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates and hand grip strength. Asian elders have a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the impact of disease (indicated by life satisfaction, mood, and common disabilities) is less than among the indigenous population. Lower peak expiratory flow rates and grip strength among Asian elders are of concern since they may lead to premature arrival at age-related thresholds of physical capacity essential for independence in activities of daily living. 
Abrupt vessel closure following platelet transfusion post-PTCA. A successful PTCA was complicated by abrupt closure following a platelet transfusion which was given for control of local bleeding. Possible mechanisms of abrupt closure are discussed. Recommendation is made to avoid giving platelet transfusion following PTCA. 
Why all placentas should be examined by a pathologist in 1990 Placental pathology is rarely a part of the training for either obstetrician or pathologist. As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care. 
Gaze-dependent hemianopia without hemispatial neglect. A hemispheric field is the space defined by the midsagittal plane of the body. Hemianopia, in the absence of hemispheric spatial neglect, has been thought to be purely retinotopic. Confrontation testing of visual fields in eccentric positions of gaze in hemianopic patients permits the discrimination of hemispheric from retinotopic deficits. In the primary position of gaze, a patient with an ischemic lesion of the right occipital and temporal lobes, who was without unilateral spatial neglect, was unable to detect finger movement, name objects, or identify shapes or colors in the left retinotopic hemifield, but when gazing 30 degrees to the right (so that the left retinotopic field was in the right hemispheric field), he performed nearly as well in the left retinotopic field as in the right. The mechanism of this gaze-dependent hemifield visual impairment is unknown, but we discuss four possibilities: (1) eccentric gaze enhances an alternative visual system; (2) the lesion led to modality-specific hemispheric inattention that was corrected by directing intention (plan to act) and gazing to the right; (3) the lesion led to modality specific inattention that was corrected by compensatory mechanisms that may normally enhance attentive vigilance in central space during eccentric gaze; and (4) the neuronal substrate for hemispheric vision was destroyed, whereas that for retinotopic vision was preserved. 
Coronary heart disease risk markers in users of low-dose oral contraceptives. Seven combination oral contraceptives (OCs) were studied for their effects on glucose, insulin, triglyceride and lipoprotein concentrations. Subjects included 925 women using fixed-dose (monophasic) or variable-dose (triphasic) formulations and 418 premenopausal women not using OCs. The monophasics contained 150 or 250 micrograms of levonorgestrel, 500 or 1,000 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel as the progestin. Triphasic progestin doses were 50-125 micrograms of levonorgestrel or 500-1,000 micrograms of norethindrone. All the formulations increased the fasting serum triglycerides. No changes were seen in serum total cholesterol. The effects on serum lipoproteins depended on the progestin type and dose. Monophasics containing 500 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Monophasics containing levonorgestrel reduced HDL cholesterol. The triphasics did not affect LDL or HDL cholesterol but altered the balance of HDL subfractions. All the formulations caused a deterioration in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance and increased pancreatic insulin secretion. The greatest effects were seen with formulations containing levonorgestrel. The study showed that a reduction in the progestin dose and use of novel progestins can reduce the potentially adverse effects of OCs on metabolic risk markers for coronary heart disease. 
Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of uveal tumors. We detected seven tumors with magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrate some of the uses and limitations of this diagnostic technique. In one patient, the correct diagnosis of extraocular extension was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging when both clinical and ultrasonographic data were not diagnostic. In another case, an extremely small area of extraocular extension was detected with ultrasound evaluation but was not noted on magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in the detection of intraocular tumors. In pigmented uveal melanomas it is both sensitive and highly specific. In amelanotic processes magnetic resonance imaging can identify a mass but cannot always adequately characterize it. Further experience will be necessary to determine the proper role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of uveal tumors. 
Socioeconomic status and visual impairment among urban Americans. Baltimore Eye Survey Research Group. The Baltimore Eye Survey is a population-based study of ocular disorders conducted in East Baltimore, Md, designed to determine the prevalence and severity of vision loss and ocular disease and their relationships to socioeconomic and other risk factors. This survey comprised 5300 subjects (2911 whites and 2389 blacks). Visual impairment was associated with age, race, general health status, educational level, income, and employment status. An identified association of race with blindness and visual impairment was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for these socioeconomic factors, indicating that socioeconomic status itself is an important determinant of visual impairment. 
Open reduction and internal fixation of two-part displaced fractures of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. Twelve patients, ranging in age from thirty-four to seventy-two years (average, fifty-three years), were evaluated an average of five years (range, two to eight years) after open reduction and internal fixation of a two-part displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. The indication for operative reduction was one centimeter or more of displacement of the fracture as seen on the diagnostic radiographs. The anterosuperior deltoid-splitting approach, combined with rotation of the humerus, allowed adequate exposure of the retracted tuberosity. Internal fixation of the greater tuberosity with heavy, non-absorbable sutures and careful repair of the rotator cuff permitted early passive motion. All fractures healed without postoperative displacement. Six patients had an excellent result and six had a good result; active elevation averaged 170 degrees. There was one partial, transient palsy of the axillary nerve. 
Steps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. 
Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of buflomedil in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon: six-month follow-up. The efficacy of buflomedil in reducing the mean daily frequency and severity of winter ischemic attacks has been shown in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 31 patients (16 in the buflomedil group, 15 in the placebo group) suffering from idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and followed up for six months. The efficacy was confirmed by nail fold capillaroscopy, which showed a significant alleviation of hemodymanic disturbances and background pallor in comparison with the placebo. Results in terms of clinical and laboratory safety parameters assessed over a six-month period were satisfactory, thus demonstrating the possibility of a long-term treatment. 
Review article: migraine and pregnancy. A 27-year-old woman with no family or personal history of migraine presented with headache associated with unilateral paresthesias and blurred vision. This was her first, and so far only, attack of migraine with aura and led to the diagnosis of her pregnancy and to this review. Migraine can begin for the first time with pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Cases of migraine with aura are the most commonly reported. Preexisting migraine usually improves with pregnancy, particularly if it was associated with menstrual migraine. Headache occurs frequently in the post-partum period, particularly in known migraineurs. Migraineurs have no increased risk of complications during pregnancy and their children have no increased incidence of birth defects. 
Foodborne outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7--North Dakota, 1990. In late July and early August 1990, an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred among persons who had eaten a meal while attending an agricultural threshing show in North Dakota on July 28-29. At least 70 (3.5%) of the more than 2000 attendees were affected; of these, 16 persons were hospitalized, and two children, aged 2 and 8 years, were diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome. An epidemiologic investigation was conducted by the North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories. 
Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis possible responsibility of captopril in the development of lesions. Kaposi's sarcoma appeared 8 months after the start of captopril treatment in a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis. A marked reduction of cutaneous and gastric lesions occurred when captopril was stopped. These findings are compared to immunosuppressive drug induced forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. 
Non-invasive assessment of perioperative myocardial cell damage by circulating cardiac troponin T. Troponin T is a unique cardiac antigen which is continuously released from infarcting myocardium. Its cardiospecificity as a marker protein might be particularly useful in assessing myocardial cell damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, circulating troponin T was measured in serial blood samples from 56 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in two control groups--22 patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery and 12 patients undergoing lung surgery by median sternotomy. In both control groups no troponin T could be detected, whereas activities of creatine kinase were raised in all 12 lung surgery controls and activities of the MB isoenzyme were raised in five of the 12 patients in the lung surgery group and in four of the 22 patients in the orthopaedic surgery group, respectively. All the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 47) and cardiac surgery for other reasons (n = 9) had detectable concentrations of troponin T. Five patients had perioperative myocardial infarction detected as new Q waves and R wave reductions. In these five patients troponin T release persisted and serum concentrations (5.5-23 micrograms/l) reached a peak on the fourth postoperative day. In the 51 patients without perioperative myocardial infarction serum concentrations and the release kinetics of troponin T depended on the duration of cardiac arrest. In patients in whom aortic cross clamping was short troponin T increased slightly on the first postoperative days; in patients with longer periods of aortic cross clamping troponin T concentrations were higher and remained so beyond the fifth postoperative day. 
Hemodialysis grafts: color Doppler flow imaging correlated with digital subtraction angiography and functional status. Twenty-two patients with hemodialysis grafts were prospectively evaluated with color Doppler flow imaging and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Eighteen patients had normal functional parameters during hemodialysis, and four had increased venous pressure during hemodialysis. Color Doppler flow imaging allowed identification of nine macroaneurysms related to wall degeneration, two cases of spontaneous fistula formation between the graft and peripheral veins, and 20 stenoses. Use of color Doppler flow imaging led to overestimation of the degree of stenosis at the venous anastomosis when compared with use of angiography. Three cases of subclavian venous stenosis were identified only at angiography. Color Doppler flow imaging appears accurate in the detection of stenoses and seems sufficient for follow-up of normally functioning grafts. However, because of its low sensitivity for identification of proximal stenoses and the necessity of obtaining an angiogram to plan surgical or percutaneous correction, DSA remains the technique of choice. 
Coronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess. A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented. Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described. 
Low angiotensinogen levels are related to the severity and liver dysfunction of congestive heart failure: implications for renin measurements. PURPOSE: To compare the determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and the direct measurement of active renin by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) as methods of assessing the renin system in patients with congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The status of the renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure was assessed by measuring the plasma renin substrate concentration, PRA, and plasma concentration of active renin in 37 patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure. Natremia and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were determined as biologic indexes of the severity of heart failure, and concentrations of prealbumin and retinol-binding protein were used as indexes of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: The PRA and the concentrations of active renin and ANF were markedly higher in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure than in patients with class II to III heart failure, while natremia and the concentrations of renin substrate, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein were markedly lower in the class IV patients than in the class II to III patients. Plasma renin substrate concentration was negatively correlated with active renin concentration (n = 37, r = -0.45, p = 0.005), and positively related to natremia (r = 0.56, p less than 0.0005), prealbumin (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001), and retinol-binding protein (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of plasma renin substrate can be considered as an indirect index of the severity of heart failure that reflects both the high level of circulating active renin and the decrease in hepatic protein output. In patients with class IV heart failure, low levels of renin substrate led to a marked underestimation of active renin concentration from measurements of PRA. In contrast, direct IRMA of active renin measures the true plasma active renin concentration, independent of plasma renin substrate, and closely reflects renin secretion. 
Human astrocytes contain two distinct angiotensin receptor subtypes. The ability of angiotensin peptides to stimulate prostaglandin release and raise intracellular calcium levels by activating a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C was assessed in three human astrocytoma cell lines (CRTG3, STTG1, and WITG2). The addition of angiotensin II to CRTG3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin, the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Angiotensin-(1-7), previously considered to be an inactive metabolite of angiotensin II, was as potent as angiotensin II for prostaglandin release but did not activate phospholipase C or mobilize intracellular calcium. In contrast, angiotensin-(2-8) caused only a slight increase in prostaglandin release, even though it was as effective as angiotensin II in augmenting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization. Moreover, neither the release of prostaglandins in response to angiotensin II or angiotensin-(1-7) nor the mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II required extracellular calcium. Angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) caused the release of prostaglandins from all three human astrocytoma cell lines, but changes in the level of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II only occurred in CRTG3 cells. Although previous studies have provided evidence for angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of selectivity of antagonists or signal transduction mechanisms, these data suggest that human astrocytes contain multiple angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of their response to different angiotensin heptapeptides--angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(2-8). 
Surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment of hepatic metastases from carcinoma of the breast. To date, no five year survival rates have been reported for patients with hepatic metastases (HM) from breast origin treated by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. This study was done to evaluate whether or not surgical excision of such metastatic disease associated with chemotherapy has any effect on such a poor prognosis. Between May 1985 and September 1988, 22 patients with a diagnosis of isolated (solitary or multiple) HM have been surgically treated. The therapeutic approach also included systemic preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Laparotomy findings for those 22 patients are presented. There were benign hepatic lesions in four patients (four different histologic types) and hepatectomy was done in two patients. Diffuse metastatic disease contraindicated any attempt at hepatic resection in six patients. Hepatectomy was possible in 12 patients. There was no postoperative mortality and minimal morbidity. One-half of the patients with metastases had one or more positive lymph nodes at the hepatic pedicule. Median survival time for 12 patients treated by hepatectomy was 37 +/- 9 months after hepatectomy and 42 +/- 3 months after the discovery of HM. Eleven patients had other metastases after an average period of 11.8 months after hepatectomy, and the liver was the first site of recurrence in eight. One patient underwent a hepatectomy twice. Two patients were free of disease 29 to 46 months postoperatively in spite of poor prognostic features on the excised specimen. Although the median survival time was two times better than with usual treatment, we believe this procedure is of doubtful benefit. In this situation, hepatectomy acts as cytoreductive surgical treatment, with the main limiting factor being the relatively low effectiveness of chemotherapy. This type of therapy can be applied only to a restricted number of patients, and if we decide to proceed with this study, we will have to modify the protocol of chemotherapy radically. 
The Health of the Public Program at the University of Washington: a new role for academic medical centers. The University of Washington Health of the Public Program has convened a consortium composed of the region's academic medical center, the two largest managed care plans in Washington, and representatives of the state's major private and public purchasers of health care. The consortium's purpose is to test the feasibility of collaboratively collecting cross-system data, assessing variations in practice, and implementing site-specific interventions to improve the management of common illnesses and encourage preventive care. Changes under way in the ambulatory training environment and in the undergraduate curriculum as a result of the consortium's initial efforts are described. In today's climate of cost consciousness and concerns about quality, academic medical centers can play an important role in helping to improve community-wide outcomes of care. 
Noninvasive detection of reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction based on plasma activity of creatine kinase MB subforms. Successful thrombolytic therapy is associated with an accelerated release of creatine kinase (CK) MB from necrotic myocardium. With use of a previously validated assay, the plasma kinetics of the myocardial subform (MB2) and the plasma-modified subform (MB1) were determined in blood samples obtained from 56 patients with acute Q wave myocardial infarction: 33 patients who received thrombolytic therapy (group A) and 23 patients managed conservatively (group B). Plasma MB2 activity increased more rapidly in the group A patients, but there was substantial overlap with group B. Plasma MB1 activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The MB2/MB1 ratio was significantly higher in group A patients than in group B patients between 2 and 10 h after the onset of infarction. Among group A patients, the ratio increased from 2.4 +/- 1.6 to 4.6 +/- 2.0 in the 1st h after therapy (p less than 0.001). The peak ratio was 6.3 +/- 2.5 in group A patients and 3.1 +/- 1.2 in group B patients. Twenty-seven of the 33 group A patients had a peak ratio greater than 3.8 versus 5 of the 23 group B patients (p less than 0.001). In seven group A patients, the ratio was greater than 3.8 before plasma CK MB activity was out of the normal range. Angiography was performed at 5.0 +/- 3.5 days in 39 patients. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients with a patent infarct-related artery had a peak ratio greater than 3.8; 17 (89.5%) of 19 patients with an occluded infarct-related artery had a ratio less than 3.8 (p less than 0.001). 
Estimate of breast cancer risk reduction with weight loss. Upper body fat localization has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. This study demonstrated that 64.2% of 124 women with at least a 4.5-kg weight loss decreased their upper body fat localization, as measured by a reduction in their suprailiac-thigh skin fold ratio and other skin fold thicknesses associated with upper body fat localization. Based on a risk model previously developed for breast cancer and upper body fat localization, a reduction in estimated breast cancer relative risk of 45% was calculated for the entire group of women who lost 4.5 kg or more in weight. Greater weight loss further reduced upper body fat localization and estimated breast cancer risk based on this model. 
Severity of childhood bacterial meningitis and duration of illness before diagnosis. Rapid diagnosis of childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) is generally believed to be essential to avoid poor outcome. To see whether duration of illness before admission to hospital was related to the severity of illness, data from children with BM diagnosed in 18 paediatric hospitals in Finland from 1984 to 1989 were collected prospectively. We divided 286 cases with culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into three groups: BM with a history of up to 24 h (short-history group, n = 141), of more than 24 h and up to 48 h (intermediate-history group, n = 75), and of more than 48 h (long-history group, n = 70). The longer the history, the better the clinical condition of the child. If symptoms or signs of BM lasted 48 h or less, the child did significantly worse, as judged by seven variables, than if the history was longer than 48 h (level of consciousness, p less than 0.001; seizures, p less than 0.01; CSF protein concentration, p less than 0.001; positive CSF gram-stain, p less than 0.01; positive blood culture, p less than 0.05 in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis; serum C-reactive protein, p less than 0.01 between intermediate-history and long-history groups; and urine sodium concentration, p less than 0.001). The differences were not affected by causative organism, sex, age, or preadmission oral antimicrobial agents. The findings show that if BM follows an insidious pattern of disease, diagnostic delay may be unavoidable, which may have medicolegal implications. 
Successful treatment of a persistent cyst, developing after ovarian transposition, with leuprolide acetate. Persistent ovarian cysts are considered to be the most troublesome complication of ovarian transposition. Transabdominal drainage or surgical removal is often required. This paper reports the successful use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, in the treatment of a symptomatic and persistent ovarian cyst which developed after ovarian transposition. The benefits of this therapy over others are discussed. 
Hereditary ataxias and paraplegias in Cantabria, Spain. An epidemiological and clinical study. A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families. 
C-reactive protein as an index of disease activity. Comparison of tenidap, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in rat adjuvant arthritis. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations are a useful plasma protein measure that correlate with disease severity and radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared 3 drugs with different mechanisms, i.e., tenidap, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, on both CRP levels and soft tissue swelling in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. CRP rose from a normal concentration of approximately 400 micrograms/ml during the first phase of adjuvant arthritis to approximately 1200 micrograms/ml (primary response), then fell to approximately 900 micrograms/ml and rose again as the disease became systemic during the secondary response to approximately 1400 micrograms/ml. When treatment was administered prophylactically, tenidap and dexamethasone suppressed both the primary and secondary CRP and swelling responses. Cyclophosphamide was without effect in the primary response, but inhibited both swelling and CRP in the secondary response. When therapeutic treatment was begun after secondary disease was established, only tenidap and dexamethasone inhibited CRP and swelling. Both dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide decreased lymphocyte numbers during treatment whereas lymphocyte numbers were elevated during tenidap treatment, suggesting a different mechanism of action for tenidap. CRP levels were more closely linked to the rate of change of paw swelling (disease progression) than to paw volume. 
Treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas with the pulsed tunable dye laser. Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of infancy and are characterized by rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas. 
Randomised trial of laxatives in treatment of childhood encopresis. Primary faecal incontinence (encopresis) in children is usually treated with laxative medication and a behaviour modification programme aimed at promoting regular toileting, but the effectiveness of laxatives has never been adequately investigated. 169 children with encopresis and evidence of stool on plain abdominal radiograph were randomly allocated to receive multimodal (MM) therapy (laxatives plus behaviour modification; n = 83) or behaviour modification alone (BM; n = 86). Mean (SD) follow-up was 55.1 (27.0) weeks and 56.7 (32.0) weeks, respectively. By 12 months' follow-up 42 (51%) of the MM group and 31 (36%) of the BM group (p = 0.079) had achieved remission (at least one 4 week period with no soiling episodes) and 52 (63%) vs 37 (43%) (p = 0.016) had achieved at least partial remission (soiling no more than once a week). MM subjects achieved remission significantly sooner than BM subjects, and the difference in the Kaplan-Meier remission curves was most striking in the first 30 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.012). The patterns of compliance with toileting in the treatment groups were almost identical, although about 1 in 8 children overall did not comply with the sitting programme. After exclusion of the 24 poor compliers, there was no significant difference between BM and MM groups. This study shows a clear advantage overall for the use of laxative medication, although the benefit may not be as great for children who are able to maintain regular toileting. 
Benign pleural effusions in long-standing diabetes mellitus. We studied intractable pleural effusions in five patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus and an additional 40 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction to determine whether the frequency of pleural effusions is increased in diabetic patients and, if so, the relation of pleural effusions to left ventricular dysfunction. In our initial observations, effusions were benign, were not always associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), and reaccumulated following thoracentesis. Effusions associated with CHF persisted despite medical treatment and improvement of CHF. In our study of 40 patients with similar degrees of left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of pleural effusions in diabetic patients was 83 percent and in our nondiabetic patients was 14 percent (p less than 0.001). We conclude that pleural effusions occur more commonly in diabetic than nondiabetic patients and may be related to left ventricular dysfunction and possibly other factors leading to increased effusion. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity. Updated results of the Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study. The Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study (MIOS) was designed to determine whether intensive multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity as compared with concurrent controls. After definitive surgery of the primary tumor, patients were randomly assigned to immediate adjuvant chemotherapy or to observation without adjuvant treatment. Updated results of this trial indicate that the projected six-year event-free survival for the control group is 11% compared to 61% for the chemotherapy group (p less than 0.001). Similar results were observed in patients who declined randomization but who were followed according to the treatment arms of the protocol. When randomized and nonrandomized patients are pooled according to assigned treatment, a survival advantage favoring those patients treated with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy is apparent. An analysis of prognostic factors among patients receiving immediate adjuvant chemotherapy reveals that elevation of the serum lactic dehydrogenase at diagnosis is the factor most predictive of adverse outcome. Location of the primary site in the tibia confers a favorable prognosis. The authors conclude that the natural history of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity has not changed over the past two decades. The administration of immediate adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant favorable impact on event-free survival and should be recommended for all such patients. 
The transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. 
Conservative management of intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast. Collaborating NSABP investigators. Seventy-six patients with intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast have been observed for 83 months (range 50-141) following treatment by lumpectomy (L) only (21), L and breast irradiation (XRT) (27), or mastectomy (28). All represented examples of DCIS retrieved after pathologic examination of a much larger cohort of patients with stage I and II invasive breast cancer enrolled in NSABP protocol 6. Local breast recurrences were similar for women with DCIS and those from this cohort at a similar period of follow-up with invasive cancer treated by L only (43% vs. 39%) and L + XRT (7% vs. 10%). The presence of moderate/marked comedonecrosis was suggestively related to local breast recurrence (P = .07). This latter was significantly reduced for patients receiving post L XRT (P = .01). All local breast recurrences in this study and 29 of 31 recorded by others occurred at or close to the site of extirpation of the index cancer minimizing multicentricity as a contraindication for the conservative surgical treatment of DCIS. Survival rates which were similar for patients with DCIS regardless of form of local treatment were better than that observed for negative node patients with invasive cancer enrolled in protocol 6. Thus, DCIS is a less, not more, ominous disease than invasive cancer. This and other features of its natural history indicate that it would be a contradiction to treat invasive cancer but not DCIS conservatively. 
Maple syrup urine disease. Complete defect of the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex due to a deletion of an 11-bp repeat sequence which encodes a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in a family with the disease. Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. 
Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome: I. Immunocytochemical evidence for a T-cell-mediated immune effector response. Specimens of muscle and fascia from 13 patients fulfilling the Centers for Disease Control criteria for the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) were studied by quantitative immunocytochemical analysis. The immunolocalization of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD22, and CD56 markers, the gamma delta T-cell receptor, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complex and class II antigens, and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) were examined. The distribution and relative proportions of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, macrophages, and eosinophils were determined at perivascular, perimysial, endomysial, and fascial sites of accumulation. At all sites, T cells were predominant, CD8+ cells outnumbered CD4+ cells 6- to 20-fold, and between 60 and 80% of T cells were activated. B cells and eosinophils each accounted for less than 3% of inflammatory cells. Very few cells expressed either the gamma delta T-cell receptor or natural killer cell markers. As in dermatomyositis (DM), MHC class I antigen complex expression was increased on many structurally normal muscle fibers, but in contrast to DM, microvascular MAC deposits were not a feature of EMS. The findings implicate a cellular immune response directed against a connective tissue component in EMS. 
The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor on human bladder cancer: potential use in radioimmunoscintigraphy. Monoclonal antibody 425, which binds to an extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, was used to evaluate the expression of this antigen on bladder cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor was found on all bladder cancer cell lines tested. Immunoperoxidase staining of fourteen invasive human bladder cancers with monoclonal antibody 425 demonstrated that ten showed strong staining, one showed weak staining and three were negative. Five noninvasive tumors were similarly examined. Four of these were negative and one showed weak staining. Biodistribution experiments with human bladder tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice using radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 425 and an isotype matched control antibody demonstrated specific tumor localization at five and seven days following antibody injection. Successful imaging of a human bladder tumor xenograft was achieved five days post antibody injection. These data confirm that epidermal growth factor receptor expression correlates with bladder cancer stage and suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor may serve as a target antigen for radioimmunoscintigraphy. 
A quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction. Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis. Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch. 
The role of hospital delivery systems in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction: rural hospital setting. Discussions on the use of thrombolytic therapy include when is the best time for administration, where is the best place for administration, and who is the most appropriate to begin the administration. Rapid triage and intervention for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction are special challenges in rural communities. To evaluate the possibility of instituting rapid, "golden hour" treatment for the patient with acute myocardial infarction, rural health care resources must be reviewed. Changes in the health care environment and access to emergent care for the patient with acute myocardial infarction directly affect any treatment. Timely interventions depend on available personnel, appropriate clinical protocols, and regional network systems. 
Antibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects. Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups. 
Endoscopic laser therapy for obstructing tracheobronchial lesions. The Lahey Clinic experience using laser bronchoscopy for relief of obstructive tracheobronchial lesions during a 7-year period from 1982 to 1989 involves 269 patients treated with 400 procedures. The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser was used for tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for all obstructing endobronchial neoplasms. Indications for therapy included severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonitis. All patients had relatively central lesions. A rigid bronchoscope was used to treat 88% of patients, and 12% of patients were treated with a flexible bronchoscope. One death occurred during the intraoperative period. Eleven deaths occurred within 1 week of therapy and were related to the presence of extensive malignant lesions or to coronary artery disease. Our experience indicates that bronchoscopic application of the CO2 or Nd:YAG laser affords effective palliation for patients with obstructive tracheobronchial lesions. The Nd:YAG laser is recommended for patients with bulky vascular endobronchial neoplasms, and the CO2 laser is best reserved for patients with benign tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. 
Cause of death in unsuccessful prehospital resuscitation. During 1987-1988, prehospital resuscitation was unsuccessful in 204 of 381 patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest due to presumed coronary heart disease in Helsinki. The cause of death was verified by autopsy in 80 (39%) of the 204 patients. Their cause of death could not be estimated on the basis of previous patient history, and their autopsy diagnoses were then related to the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at the scene. At autopsy, coronary heart disease was considered to have been the cause of death in 78% of the patients with ventricular fibrillation, in 43% of the patients with electromechanical dissociation (EMD), and in 60% of the patients in asystole. Cardiac tamponade or massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in 15 of the 28 patients with EMD who underwent autopsy. These findings support previously noted relationships between some causes of cardiac arrest and the initial cardiac rhythm, and also in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with unsuccessful resuscitation. 
Evidence from cadavers suggestive of entrapment of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by lumbosacral ligaments. Lumbosacral spines from 51 geriatric-age cadavers (25 men and 26 women) were examined both grossly and under the dissecting microscope for evidence of compression of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by their respective lumbosacral ligaments. These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs. 
MR evaluation of CNS tumors: dose comparison study with gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol. In phase II and III trials of gadoteridol (Gd-HP-D03A), a new nonionic, low-osmolar contrast agent, 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with experimental doses of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Fifteen patients also underwent contrast studies with the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol appear to have a similar effect when given in equal doses (0.1 mmol/kg, n = 5). Lesion enhancement and delineation were better at higher experimental doses (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, n = 7) and worse at a lower experimental dose (0.05 mmol/kg, n = 3). Quantitative analysis of 10 lesions examined with identical imaging protocols revealed a directly proportional relationship (r = .975) between lesion contrast ratio and dose over a range of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Phantom experiments support the clinical results. Improved enhancement, detection, and delineation of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms resulting from increased injected doses of gadoteridol have the potential to be clinically significant and may justify the possibly higher cost of increased contrast material dosage. Lower doses may not be adequate for the evaluation of most CNS tumors. 
Importance of the renin-angiotensin system in sodium regulation in essential hypertension. To elucidate the effect of natriuretic and antinatriuretic factors on the excretion of an intravenous sodium load, we observed the natriuretic responses of 12 patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and 7 age- and sex-matched normotensive (NT) subjects following the intravenous administration of 1500 mL of normal saline over a 3 h period. After saline infusion, both groups showed increases in urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). The increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary dopamine excretion (UDAV) and the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) were similar in both groups. However, no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was seen in either group. Since significant negative linear correlations between the basal level of PRA and percent change in UNaV or GFR were seen only in EHT, we observed the influence of suppressing the renin-angiotensin system with a converting enzyme inhibitor. After a 7 day treatment with enalapril, GFR and UNaV in EHT after saline infusion were comparable to data obtained in the absence of enalapril, despite a reduction in preexpansion BP. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the basal BP and the percent increase in UNaV was seen among EHT after enalapril treatment. These results suggest that the state of the renin-angiotensin system is important in renal sodium excretion in EHT. 
Mechanisms of otitis media development. Involvement of neurogenic inflammation. The mucosal lining of the middle ear cavity, in particular that of the tympanic membrane and its pars flaccida, exhibits a number of sensory nerves containing the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The mucosa is not only rich in nerves and blood vessels but also contains numerous mast cells. It is possible that interactions between histamine-containing mast cells and SP-containing and CGRP-containing nerves--neurogenic inflammation--is one of the mechanisms involved in vessel permeability changes in otitis media with effusion. 
Telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. 
Clinical features of 31 patients with Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma Thirty-one patients were diagnosed by morphologic and immunophenotypic features as having primary Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL). the median age was 35 years (range, 4 months to 78 years); the male:female ratio was 18:13. B symptoms were observed in 13 patients. Peripheral adenopathy was present in 26 patients, while mediastinal adenopathy occurred in five. There was extranodal disease in 13 patients; the most common extranodal site was skin with seven affected. Seventeen patients had stage III/IV disease. Immunophenotypes were T cell in 24 patients and B cell in four patients; immunophenotype could not be determined in three patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities in chromosomes 2, 5, and 7 were detected in three patients. Although therapy was heterogeneous, the actuarial 2-year survival was 73%. Two-year disease-free survival was 39% for all patients; for stages I and II, it was 62% compared with 20% for stages III and IV (P = .001). Complete remission (CR) occurred in 21 of 23 patients receiving combination chemotherapy; however, nine relapses, including six of seven stage IV patients, occurred within 21 months of diagnosis. Preliminary observations suggest that Ki-1 ALCL may have a quiescent phase in the rare patient with only localized skin disease. However, the disease generally behaves as an intermediate- to high-grade lymphoma, and patients with Ki-1 ALCL should receive curative-intent combination chemotherapy. 
Renal vascular response to sodium loading in sons of hypertensive parents. Studies of normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents offer the potential to identify inherited abnormalities that contribute to essential hypertension. We compared renal and systemic hemodynamic responses to saline infusion between normotensive sons of two hypertensive parents (SOHT) and sons of two normotensive parents (SONT) selected from the general population of Rochester, Minn. Hemodynamic measurements were performed after a week of low sodium intake (10 meq/day) and were repeated after a week of high sodium intake (200 meq/day). Despite being in the normotensive range, blood pressures in SOHT were higher than those in SONT during low sodium (124 +/- 3/85 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 2/71 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and high sodium (122 +/- 3/80 +/- 3 versus 112 +/- 2/70 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) conditions. Higher pressures in SOHT were associated with elevated systemic and renal vascular resistance. After a high sodium diet, renal vascular resistance in SOHT rose further during acute saline infusion, whereas systemic vascular resistance did not change. After a low sodium diet, this renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in SOHT was not present, and renal vascular resistance fell to levels not different from SONT. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide did not differ between SONT and SOHT. Circulating levels of norepinephrine were higher in SOHT. These data demonstrate a renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in normotensive SOHT, which depends on prior sodium intake. This alteration in renal hemodynamics may represent an inherited abnormality related to the development of hypertension. 
Solitary polyclonal autonomous thyroid nodule: a rare cause of childhood hyperthyroidism. Solitary autonomous thyroid tumors are an unusual cause of hyperthyroidism, particularly in childhood. We describe the youngest individual so far reported with this condition, a 22 month child with a large hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule who became overtly hyperthyroid after iodinated contrast administration. The histology of the nodule was compatible with follicular cell hyperplasia. These tumors are often called toxic adenomas, although there is no solid evidence that they are true neoplasms. We examined the clonal composition of the child's thyroid tumor by X-chromosome inactivation analysis, taking advantage of a polymorphism in the X-chromosome gene phosphoglycerate kinase. The tumor consisted of an even mixture of cells containing activated paternal and maternal PGK alleles, indicating that the tumor was polyclonal. Furthermore, the nodule had no structural rearrangements or activating point mutations of ras oncogenes, which are found in up to 50% of solitary monoclonal follicular adenomas. Solitary hot nodules may at least in some cases be secondary to hyperplasia, and not to clonal expansion of an abnormal, mutated cell. This may also explain the relatively low frequency of malignant transformation observed in hyperfunctioning thyroid tumors. 
Temperature and total white blood cell count as indicators of bacteremia. This study was designed to quantify more precisely the accuracy of magnitude of rectal temperature and total white blood cell (WBC) count as indicators of bacteremia in children with an obvious focal bacterial infection. A total of 955 children, aged 3 to 36 months, who had rectal temperature greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C and were seeking care at either of two urban pediatric emergency departments had blood drawn for culture; 885 had blood drawn for WBC count. Twenty-seven had bacteremia. Various combinations of temperature and WBC count were selected to construct receiver-operating-characteristic curves by plotting sensitivity vs false-positive rate (1 - specificity). The receiver-operating-characteristic curve of WBC count provided significantly better diagnostic information than the curve for temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C. Each increment of 0.5 degrees C led to large decrements in sensitivity and false-positive rates. At a WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3, the sensitivity was 92% while the false-positive rate was 57%. Using this cutoff point, the clinician could have avoided performing 368 of 955 blood cultures and missed only 2 of 26 children with bacteremia. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves combining WBC count and temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C provided no better diagnostic information than that of WBC count at a temperature cutoff of 39.0 degrees C. It is concluded that increments in temperature above 39.0 degrees C provided additional diagnostic specificity for bacteremia only at the expense of unacceptable decreases in sensitivity. Total WBC count provided better information. A WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3 increased specificity with minimal decrease in sensitivity. 
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Fatal progression of pulmonary hypertension despite steroid-induced remission of interstitial pneumonitis. This report describes a 28-yr-old patient with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). She presented with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and interstitial pneumonitis. We report the discordance between the response of her hypoxemia and interstitial pneumonitis, which resolved with corticosteroid therapy, and her progressive pulmonary hypertension, which caused fatal right heart failure. This report emphasizes that the radiographic interstitial shadowing of PVOD may be caused by either (1) an inflammatory interstitial pneumonitis (which may be responsive to anti-inflammatory therapy) or (2) interstitial pulmonary edema, or both. 
Low-dose isradipine once daily effectively controls 24-h blood pressure in essential hypertension. In one study of 10 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, equivalent total daily doses (13 +/- 2 mg) of isradipine given twice daily and a modified-release formulation of isradipine (isradipine MR) given once daily were found to control adequately 24 h ambulatory blood pressure compared with placebo (P less than .001 for each v placebo). In another study of 22 patients with essential hypertension, 5 and 10 mg isradipine MR once daily has been shown to reduce the average 24 h blood pressure by 11 +/- 1/6 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001) and 13 +/- 2/9 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001), respectively, compared with placebo. There was no loss of efficacy with isradipine MR during the 24 h observation period with either dose. In conclusion, low-dose isradipine MR once daily is an effective first-line treatment in essential hypertension. 
Pediatric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed 42 times in 38 patients aged 14 months to 20 yr at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1982 to 1990. The adult side-viewing duodenoscope, Olympus JF1T, was used for all procedures. Intravenous sedation was used in 68% of the patients, whereas general anesthesia was employed in the remainder. Visualization of the appropriate ductal system was accomplished in 35 patients (92%). No therapeutic maneuvers were performed at endoscopy. Eleven of the 22 patients with ductal abnormalities underwent surgical treatment, based on the ERCP findings. The only complication encountered was mild pancreatitis in three patients (8%), all with a history of pancreatitis. We conclude that ERCP is a safe, useful procedure in the evaluation of children with pancreaticobiliary disorders, and in the identification of surgically correctable lesions in 29% of those patients. 
Venous emboli occurring caesarean section: the effect of patient position. The effect of position, horizontal versus 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's, on the incidence of venous emboli during Caesarean section was evaluated in 207 patients. Venous emboli were diagnosed using precordial ultrasonic Doppler monitoring. In the horizontal position, 44% (60 of 134) parturients had venous emboli compared with 1% (1 of 73) parturients in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position (P less than 0.0001). Epidural anaesthesia was performed in 171 patients, and 36 patients had general anaesthesia. In the epidural group, pulse oximetric haemoglobin oxygen desaturation and complaints of chest pain and/or dyspnoea were associated with the venous emboli. Venous emboli, probably air, occur frequently during Caesarean section with the patient in the horizontal position. This occurrence was minimized by placing the patient in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position. 
Recognizing early Parkinson's disease. Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should cover not only the classic disorder described by James Parkinson in 1817 (paralysis agitans) but also numerous other idiopathic and secondary disorders that have varying degrees of parkinsonian features. Because treatment options can vary greatly among mimicking disorders and differ from those effective for Parkinson's disease, a prompt, accurate diagnosis is essential. Physicians can distinguish between these often-overlapping disorders by differentiating primary from secondary parkinsonism and by classifying primary syndromes into disorders with prominent tremor and those without. 
Spontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. 
An in vivo model of experimental arterial stenosis, intimal damage, and periodic thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a "critical stenosis." Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury. 
Characterization of recombinant factor VIII and a recombinant factor VIII deletion mutant using a rabbit immunogenicity model system. The use of factor VIII prepared genetically engineered cell lines (rFVIII) may avoid some of the problems inherently associated with administering plasma-derived factor VIII (pdFVIII) concentrates to hemophilia A patients. Although rFVIII may represent an improvement over traditional therapeutics, the chance exists that protein production in cell culture may result in the presence of novel epitopes that may enhance the formation of inhibitor antibodies capable of neutralizing either rFVIII or pdFVIII. To assess the differences between rFVIII and its plasma-derived homologue, a rabbit immunogenicity model system was developed. Antibodies raised to rFVIII in rabbits were tested for the presence of antibodies capable of binding rFVIII but not pdFVIII, the presence of which would suggest that novel epitope(s) were present. This analysis was performed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as immunoadsorption. For either technique, rFVIII-specific antibodies were not detected, indicating that differences between rFVIII and pdFVIII were not found. When a rFVIII B-region deletion mutant was similarly tested, antibodies specific for this protein were found. These specific antibodies appeared to bind in the vicinity of the deletion site and their binding was not affected by carbohydrate removal. These results indicate that the rabbit immunogenicity model system is sensitive to alterations in the factor VIII molecule and suggest that full-length rFVIII will not be any more immunogenic in human patients than pdFVIII. 
Thrombin and parathyroid hormone mobilize intracellular calcium in rat osteosarcoma cells by distinct pathways. The mechanisms by which PTH and thrombin mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) were examined in UMR 106-H5 rat osteosarcoma cells. Bovine PTH-(1-34) (24 pM to 240 nM) produced a dose-dependent increase in Cai2+ (EC50, 3 nM), which returned to baseline within 75 sec. Human alpha-thrombin produced an increase in Cai2+ (ECmax, 10 U/ml) which was similar to that of PTH with respect to both magnitude and time course. Chelation of extracellular calcium with 5.0 mM EGTA did not alter the Cai2+ response to either PTH or thrombin. When added together at maximally effective concentrations, PTH and thrombin produced additive effects on Cai2+ in the presence and absence of EGTA. The additive effects of PTH and thrombin on Cai2+ were confirmed at the single cell level, using laser-based image analysis. Bradykinin (1 microM) produced a significant increase in Cai2+ in UMR 106-H5 cells which was of lesser magnitude than the peak 2- to 3-fold increase elicited by PTH or thrombin. Preexposure of cells to 10 U/ml thrombin for 2 min abolished the Cai2+ response to bradykinin, whereas preexposure to 240 nM PTH had no effect on the Cai2+ response to bradykinin. Thrombin elicited a rapid increase in the accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (IP2 and IP3) in UMR 106-H5 cells, with increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 detectable as early as 15 sec after the addition of thrombin. Bradykinin increased [3H]IP production to a lesser extent than thrombin, whereas PTH neither increased [3H]IP accumulation nor potentiated the [3H]IP response to thrombin. The results suggest that thrombin and bradykinin mobilize Cai2+ from a shared IP3-responsive calcium pool, whereas PTH may use signals in addition to 1,4,5-IP3 to mobilize calcium from a distinct cellular calcium pool. Alternatively, specific calcium compartmentalization exists, and there is differential coupling of these agonists to the 1,4,5-IP3/Cai2+ pathway. 
Disturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence. Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that "endocrinologic silence" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill. 
Kinetics of Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination and evolution of disease after intradermal inoculation of mice. Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination to selected target organs was examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, and 30 after intradermal inoculation of 4-week-old C3H mice. Infection was determined by culture (blood, spleen, kidney, ear punch); polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for outer surface protein A (OSP A) DNA (ear punch); histology and spirochete histochemistry (spleen, kidney, skin, heart, joints); and OSP A DNA in situ hybridization (joints, heart). Blood or spleen of most mice were culture positive by day 3 and ear punch by day 10. Polymerase chain reaction performed on ear punches was also positive by day 10. Inflammation of joints and tendons began on days 4 through 7 and heart on days 7 through 10, which coincided with colonization of tissues with spirochetes. Spirochetes were multifocal in distribution, with a predilection for collagenous connective tissue of joints, heart, arteries, nerves, muscle, skin, and other tissues. Relative numbers of spirochetes peaked at 15 days, then decreased by 21 days. Gamma M immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody was detectable on immunoblots as early as day 4, with subsequent declining reactivity, and IgG antibody was detectable by day 7, with expanding reactivity to multiple antigens through day 30. 
Efficacy and toxicity of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy and possible side effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were assessed for 24 patients who presented with grades I to IV of the Hunt and Hess classification. All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients. 
Constrictive pericarditis masquerading as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and constrictive pericarditis (CP) share many common clinical features. Over the last year we encountered three patients in whom CP clinically mimicked BCS. Two of the three did not even have raised jugular venous pressure. One patient with severe jaundice and hepatic coma ultimately died. Liver biopsy features were not discriminating. The final diagnosis of CP was established by echocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT), or cardiac catheterization. We conclude that in all patients with apparent BCS and atypical features, a noninvasive test like echocardiography or chest CT should be done to rule out treatable illness like CP before embarking on such invasive procedures as liver biopsy for diagnosis. 
Calcium and carcinogenesis of the mammary gland. Effects of dietary calcium on mammary carcinogenesis in rats were investigated because of evidence that calcium counteracts the promotion of colon cancer by dietary fat and because experimental diets for rats normally contain higher amounts of calcium and vitamin D than do human diets. Our earlier experiments indicated that yields of tumors induced in young, Sprague-Dawley rats by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were higher when dietary calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were decreased. Results of an experiment in which dietary amounts of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were varied independently suggested that phosphate and vitamin D have interactive effects with calcium. Another experiment in which dietary vitamin D alone was varied provided evidence that higher amounts inhibited tumorigenesis in the presence of low amounts of calcium and phosphate but the results with a high-calcium and -phosphate diet were inconclusive. The findings suggest that low amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D and high amounts of phosphate increase susceptibility to DMBA-induced mammary neoplasia. 
Human beta-galactosidase gene mutations in GM1-gangliosidosis: a common mutation among Japanese adult/chronic cases. Molecular analysis of the human beta-galactosidase gene revealed six different mutations in 10 of 11 Japanese GM1-gangliosidosis patients. They were the only abnormalities in each allele examined in this study. A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed. 
Short- and long-term psychological status following stroke. Short form MMPI results. Indices of self-reported depression and psychological adjustment after stroke were evaluated using a short form of the MMPI. Patients with poststroke periods of 2 to 6 and 7 to 24 months were selected, and indices of general intellectual functioning and lesion size/location were obtained. Despite similar levels of intellectual functioning and lesion parameters, the longer duration group showed significantly higher depression scores and significant (T greater than 70) elevations on several other clinical scales of the MMPI. In contrast, the mean overall profile of the short-duration group was roughly within normal limits. These findings have implications for the clinical assessment and treatment of stroke patients and long-term psychological adjustment after stroke. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Protein status and metabolic expenditure determine the response to intravenous nutrition--a new classification of surgical malnutrition. To determine whether nutritional and metabolic factors affect the response to intravenous nutrition (IVN) 146 surgical patients were classified according to their protein and metabolic status using direct measurements of body protein and metabolic expenditure. The patients were grouped into four categories: category I, moderate to severe protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; category II, moderate to severe protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure; category III, mild protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; and category IV, mild protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure. After 2 weeks of IVN patients in category I gained a mean(s.e.m.) of 0.43(0.06) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and had significant rises in both plasma transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05); patients in category II gained 0.30(0.11) kg of protein (P less than 0.005) and also had significant rises in transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05). Patients in category III lost 0.24(0.11) kg protein (P less than 0.05) and had no changes in either transferrin or prealbumin and patients in category IV lost 0.51(0.13) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and although there was a significant rise in plasma prealbumin there was no significant change in plasma transferrin. When postoperative patients were examined separately, they did not differ significantly from preoperative patients except in category I, where their protein gain was only 0.19(0.10) kg, an amount not significantly different from that gained by patients in category II. In each of the four categories described, the changes in total body protein occurring with 2 weeks of IVN were determined by the relative effects of two competing processes; protein depletion and raised metabolic expenditure. With moderate to severe protein depletion (approximately 30 per cent depletion of body protein stores) there was a marked tendency to gain protein with IVN. When the patient had a raised metabolic expenditure or was postoperative this tendency of depleted patients to gain protein was still present but it was less. With only mild protein depletion (approximately 10 per cent depletion) increases in metabolic expenditure made it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent continuing protein loss in spite of aggressive nutritional support. The patient categories we have described determine the response to IVN and form the basis of a new clinical classification of surgical malnutrition. 
Malignancy and chronic wounds: Marjolin's ulcer. Malignancy in chronic wounds is not uncommon and has been reported as occurring in chronic scars of diverse causes. We report an unusual case of bilateral thermal injuries of the lower extremities that 40 years later presented as very large, painful, fungating wounds of both lower legs. After histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma, eradication of the disease required amputations of both the lower extremities and reconstructive procedures. In addition, we discuss current theories regarding the mechanism of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds and evaluate treatment on the basis of information currently available in the literature. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy: the whole truth. An 8 year experience of 602 patients (median age 76 years) referred for endoscopic management of common bile stones is reported. No patient referred for treatment has been excluded. A diagnostic cholangiogram was achieved in 94 per cent and sphincterotomy was accomplished in 91.5 per cent. The bile ducts were demonstrated to be completely cleared of stones in 491 (81.6 per cent) of 602 patients. A mean number of 1.9 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations per patient were necessary to achieve this result. Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy, which were strictly defined, occurred in 10.5 per cent of patients although five patients had two complications (total complication rate 11.3 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 per cent, seven of 13 deaths (1.2 per cent) occurring as a direct result of sphincterotomy. There have been statistically significant improvements in bile duct clearance and complication rates with increasing experience of endoscopists. 
Prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents. OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have described prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Morphological, radiological, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features. A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen is described. Its rapid enlargement, demonstrable by ultrasound studies and computed tomographic scan, its gross appearance, and some of its histologic features suggested malignant lymphoma. However, a characteristic circumferential zonal pattern and polytypic immunophenotype helped to establish the correct diagnosis. In retrospect, the zonal pattern was also identified radiologically. 
Regulation of the oncodevelopmental expression of type 1 chain ABH and Lewis(b) blood group antigens in human colon by alpha-2-L-fucosylation. Blood group antigen expression in the distal human colon is related to the development of the organ and is modified by malignant transformation. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these changes, we have (a) analysed the activity of glycosyltransferases coded for by the H, Se, Le, X, and A genes, in tissue biopsy specimens from normal and malignant proximal and distal human colon; (b) characterised the glycosphingolipids expressed in the various regions of normal and malignant colon by immunostaining of high performance thin layer chromatography plates; and (c) located the antigens on tissue sections from the same subjects by immunohistochemistry. In both secretors and non-secretors we found a significantly higher activity of alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases in carcinomatous rectal tissue than in tissue from normal subjects, whereas the other transferase activities studied showed no significant differences. The acceptor substrate specificity suggested that both the Se and the H gene dependent alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases are increased in carcinomas. In non-malignant tissue the only enzyme which showed appreciably higher activity in caecum than in rectum was alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase. Immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry showed alpha-2-L-fucosylated structures in normal caecum from secretors and in tumour tissue from both secretors and non-secretors. We conclude that the alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases control the expression of ABH, and Lewis(b) structures in normal and malignant colon. 
Follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery. A follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery was performed. During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms complicated by spontaneous iliocaval or duodenal fistulae. Seven hundred and twenty one abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated between 1960 and 1985. Twenty one of these (2.9%) were complicated by the development of a spontaneous primary fistula, 16 (2.2%) into the vena cava or iliac veins and 5 (0.7%) into the duodenum. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only four instances, two aorto-caval and two aorto-duodenal fistulae. Hospital mortality was 44% for aorto-caval and 60% for aorto-duodenal fistulae. Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures. 
A case of intracerebral air embolism secondary to the insertion of a Hickman line. Complications following the insertion of intravenous catheters are relatively uncommon. We report a potentially serious, hitherto unrecognized complication of Hickman line insertion, and discuss the condition. 
Isolation and direct characterization of resident microglial cells from the normal and inflamed central nervous system. In addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (CNS), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen CD45, many cells were coisolated that were MRC OX42+ (complement receptor 3/CD11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Most cells from normal CNS, in contrast, lay within this latter, CD45low population. From previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated CD45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. Using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating CD45, CD4, and MHC class I molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of MHC class II molecules. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed CNS provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. In normal CNS, a very small population of blood-derived CD45high-expressing cells are present; most MHC class II expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia. 
Grading of human urothelial carcinoma based on nuclear atypia and mitotic frequency. I. Histological description. The World Health Organization (WHO) grade II bladder tumors constitute a clinically and histologically heterogeneous group due to imprecise histological definitions. In an attempt to improve this problem 124 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were histologically reviewed using a modified Bergkvist system. The grade II tumors were divided into 2 groups, grades IIa and IIb, mainly with reference to the degree of nuclear atypia and number of mitoses. Using definitions possible to express by numerical means, the separation was easy and reproducible. Due to great histological resemblance between certain close grades we propose a new grading system with 3 grades combining I and IIa (grade A), IIb and III (grade B), and a third group (grade C) for the anaplastic tumors. 
Typical and atypical bronchopulmonary carcinoids. A clinicopathologic and flow cytometric study. The clinicopathologic and flow cytometric characteristics of 47 bronchopulmonary carcinoids were assessed, relative to patient survival. Aneuploidy was associated more often with tumor size of greater than or equal to 3.0 cm (P less than 0.004) and lymph node (P less than 0.013) or vascular involvement (P less than 0.004). Also, an aneuploid DNA content was seen significantly more often in histologically atypical (79%) than in typical carcinoid neoplasms (18%) (P less than 0.0001). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed that the histologic category (typical vs. atypical) and ploidy pattern were important prognostic indicators. Size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular involvement were also significant predictors of outcome. Histologically atypical carcinoids with diploid DNA content pursued a less aggressive course than did their aneuploid counterparts. 
Down's syndrome and mixed acute leukemia in infants. The routine use of panels of monoclonal antibodies has been complementary to the French-American-British (FAB) leukemia classification, and has unmasked the occurrence of mixed acute leukemia (myeloid-lymphoid). It is widely accepted that children with Down's syndrome (DS) have a high incidence of acute leukemia. There is an extensive body of literature emphasizing the cytogenetic findings in these children. However, information as to the immunophenotype is often limited to the lymphoid surface determinants. The authors report two children with DS whose leukemic blasts were studied with a panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies (myeloid, lymphoid, and megakaryocytic) by flow cytometric examination and were classified as biphenotypic acute leukemia. The blast population coexpressed myeloid and T-cell surface markers. The lymphoid origin was ruled out on the basis of negative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and molecular analysis demonstrating germline configuration for the JH and beta TCR genes. 
The impact of breast-conserving treatment and mastectomy on the quality of life of early-stage breast cancer patients: a review. In recent years, doubt has been shed on the necessity of mastectomy for women with early-stage breast cancer. Apart from purely medical studies comparing (radical) mastectomy to less intruding surgical treatment, a number of studies (N = 18) have been published investigating the impact of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy on quality of life. We review these studies with respect to medical issues (treatment modality, stage of disease), methodologic issues (design, measurement moment, sample size), and results (psychologic discomfort, changes in life patterns, fears and concerns). It is concluded that there is no solid proof of a better psychologic adjustment after breast-conserving treatment and that there are no substantial differences between the different treatment modalities in changes of life patterns and fears and concerns. However, the results with respect to body image and sexual functioning favor the use of breast-conserving treatment. 
Termination of central sleep apnea episodes by upper airway stimulation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. A 52-year-old man presented with pure central sleep apnea syndrome that failed to respond to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) therapy. Intermittent positive pressure stimulation via a nasal mask was instituted using a portable positive pressure ventilator. We found marked reduction in the respiratory disturbance index, number of desaturations, and the number of arousals with this mode of therapy. 
Prevalence of obesity in a Native Hawaiian population. Mortality data indicate that Native Hawaiians have higher death rates when compared with the US all-races population, and full-blooded Native Hawaiians are likely to have the highest mortality rates from heart disease in the nation. However, to date no comprehensive population-based study of risk factors in Native Hawaiians has been conducted. In this study of 257 Native Hawaiian adults, 62.8% of the women and 65.5% of the men were greater than or equal to 20% overweight by the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) standards. Thirty-four percent of the women and 47% of the men were severely overweight. The mean body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) was 30.3 in women and 30.9 in men. Women aged 45-54 y were heaviest with a mean BMI of 31.6. Of the men aged 25-34 y, 79.2% were overweight. The mean waist-to-hip ratio was 0.85 for women and 0.95 for men in this sample. 
Mitomycin C-loaded microcapsules in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Pharmacokinetics of regionally administered particulate chemotherapy. Microencapsulated mitomycin C has been used for the treatment of intrahepatic tumors in Japan, but there have been no reports of its use in western countries. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profile of intrahepatic arterial mitomycin C microcapsules is reported. Regional mitomycin C was administered to six patients, both in the microencapsulated form and in solution. The clearance (140 +/- 31 1/hour, mean +/- SD) and half-life of drug in plasma (0.39 +/- 0.03 hours), and volume distribution (246 +/- 23 1) were significantly higher, and peak drug concentrations (80 +/- 75 ng/ml) significantly lower with the microencapsulated preparation than with the free drug (clearance, 46 +/- 8 1/hour; half-life, 0.11 +/- 0.02 hours; volume distribution, 33 +/- 4; peak drug concentration, 812 +/- 423 ng/ml), on Student's t testing (P less than 0.05). The results show that very little systemic exposure is associated with the microencapsulated form of mitomycin C. Dose escalation should be feasible without increasing systemic toxicity. 
Expression of glutathione S-transferase-pi messenger RNA in human esophageal cancers. The expression of human glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in resected primary esophageal tumors and in matching normal esophageal mucosa from 25 patients undergoing radical surgery was measured by RNA blot hybridization. The RNA transcript levels of GST-pi in the tumor tissues were higher than those in normal tissues in 20 of 25 cases (80%). The mean GST-pi mRNA value in the tumor tissues (n = 25) was significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated as compared with that in background mucosa (n = 29), and in ten of 25 tumors (40%) the level of GST-pi mRNA exceeded the mean normal tissue value by two standard deviations (normal mean value + 2 X SD). The results obtained from the current experiment thus suggests that GST-pi might be a useful marker for human esophageal cancer. No correlation between GST-pi mRNA level and clinical stage or histologic characteristics was apparent. 
Adhesion formation after laparoscopic surgery in tubal pregnancy: a randomized trial versus laparotomy. OBJECTIVE: Women with ectopic pregnancy (EP) who have been operated on by laparoscopy are thought to have improved subsequent fertility, probably because of less adhesion formation. We aimed to evaluate the adhesion formation after laparoscopy as compared with laparotomy in a randomized trial. DESIGN: One hundred five patients with tubal pregnancy were stratified with regard to age and risk factors and randomized to surgery by laparoscopy or laparotomy. To evaluate adhesion formation and tubal status, 73 patients with strong desire of pregnancy underwent a second-look laparoscopy. The adhesion status at the ipsilateral and contralateral side at primary surgery was compared with the status at second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: Patients operated on by laparotomy developed significantly more adhesions at the operated side than patients operated on by laparoscopy (P less than 0.001). Substantially more patients in the laparotomy group underwent adhesiolysis at second-look laparoscopy than did patients in the laparoscopy group. Tubal patency did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic treatment of EP results in less impairment of the pelvic status compared with conventional conservative surgery. 
Expression of intrahepatic hepatitis D viral antigen in chronic hepatitis D virus infection. To elucidate the biological importance of intrahepatic hepatitis D virus antigen, its expression was correlated with biochemical and histological inflammatory activity in 98 biopsy specimens from 68 patients seropositive for total antibody to the virus. Seventy five specimens were positive for intrahepatic nuclear antigen for HDV antigen accompanied by cytoplasmic HDV antigen in only one biopsy specimen. This group had significantly higher serum transaminase activities and inflammatory activity than the remaining cases that were negative for HDV antigen. Among the group positive for HDV antigen, there was no correlation between the proportion of hepatocytes containing HDV antigen and either serum transaminase activity or histological inflammatory indices. In 22 HDV antigen positive patients who had follow up biopsy specimens taken at a median of two years, the proportion with cirrhosis increased from 36% to 73%. Serum transaminase activities remained the same during this period, but the proportion of HDV antigen positive cells dropped. Follow up of 51 patients showed that 21 died or underwent liver transplantation within three years. The absence of an association between intrahepatic HDV antigen expression and progression of histological liver damage does not support the view that HDV is directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. Immune mediated mechanisms may have a role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease related to HDV infection. 
Patterns of mortality in sickle cell disease in the United Kingdom. Eighteen of 384 patients entered on the Brent sickle cell disease register died between 1974 and 1989, a mortality of one per 128 years of follow up. Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented. 
Evidence of c-myc gene abnormalities in mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma of young adult age. Six cases of mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLCL) with sclerosis were analyzed for the presence and patterns of c-myc and bcl-2 loci rearrangements, and for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization, c-myc gene alterations were found in three of six cases. Two cases showed the presence of mutations or small rearrangements at the 3' end of the first exon. The c-myc gene abnormalities found in these two cases are similar to those observed in the translocation 8;14 of the endemic Burkitt's lymphomas or in its variants t(2;8) and t(8;22). A third case showed a major rearrangement of c-myc gene, with truncation within its first intron, similar to those observed in sporadic Burkitt's and in acquired immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas. None of the cases displayed bcl-2 gene rearrangements or contained viral sequences. Our data suggest a possible role for a translocation-mediated c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of MLCL. Conversely, bcl-2 gene and Epstein-Barr virus do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these peculiar lymphomas. The association between c-myc structural modifications and MLCL also seems to be of relevance in light of the peculiar tendency of this tumor to involve unusual extranodal site (eg, kidney), reminiscent of the spreading attitude of Burkitt's limphomas. 
Mortality among workers exposed to ethylene oxide. BACKGROUND. Ethylene oxide is a sterilant gas that causes leukemia and other cancers in animals. Studies in Sweden have shown an excess of leukemia and stomach cancer in humans exposed to ethylene oxide, but other studies have generally failed to confirm these findings. METHODS. We conducted a study of mortality in 18,254 U.S. workers exposed to ethylene oxide at 14 plants producing sterilized medical supplies and spices. The subjects averaged 4.9 years of exposure to the gas and 16 years of follow-up. The exposure levels in recent years averaged 4.3 ppm (eight-hour time-weighted adjusted exposure) for sterilizer operators and 2.0 ppm for other workers. The levels in earlier years are likely to have been several times higher. Mortality in this cohort was compared with that in the general U.S. population. RESULTS. Overall there was no significant increase in mortality from any cause in the study cohort. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.97 for leukemia (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.67; 13 deaths observed), 1.06 for all hematopoietic cancers (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.47; 36 deaths), and 0.94 for stomach cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.70; 11 deaths). Analyses according to job category and according to the duration of exposure showed no excess in cancers, as compared with the rate in the general population, but there was a significant trend toward increased mortality with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure for all hematopoietic cancers. The rate of death from hematopoietic cancer (especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 1.55; 27 deaths). Mortality from leukemia in recent years (1985 through 1987) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 3.45; 5 deaths). CONCLUSIONS. For the entire cohort, there was no increase in mortality from hematopoietic cancer. There was a slight but significant increase among men, however. Among men and women combined, there was a trend toward an increased risk of death from hematopoietic cancer with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure to ethylene oxide. 
Propranolol ameliorates the development of portal-systemic shunting in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. We investigated the role of early portal hypotensive pharmacotherapy in preventing the development of portal-systemic shunting in a portal hypertensive model of chronic murine schistosomiasis induced by infecting C3H mice with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system. 
Arrhythmogenic effects of graded coronary blood flow reductions superimposed on prior myocardial infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. We studied arrhythmogenesis and its underlying pathophysiology during graded reductions of coronary blood flow, superimposed on prior myocardial infarction to test the hypothesis that spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and induced ventricular tachycardia are dependent on different patterns of coronary flow reduction in hearts with prior myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 sham-operated dogs (control group) and 24 dogs with 3-week-old experimental apical myocardial infarction, the left circumflex coronary artery was constricted to produce four grades of flow reduction: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Among the sham-operated control animals, only one of 10 (10%) developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and only two of nine (22%) were inducible into sustained ventricular tachycardia during 100% circumflex coronary artery flow reduction. No spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or inducible ventricular tachycardia occurred with lesser grades (25%, 50%, or 75%) of flow reduction among the control animals. In the myocardial infarction group, five of 24 dogs (21%) were inducible before flow reduction. However, 50% flow reduction in the myocardial infarction group resulted in inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in 12 of 24 dogs (50%); nine of 16 (56%) during 75% flow reduction; and six of 11 (55%) with 100% flow reduction. In addition, none of the dogs in the myocardial infarction group developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 25% or 50% flow reduction, whereas six of 22 (27%) developed ventricular fibrillation during 75% flow reduction and 10 of 21 (48%) during 100% flow reduction. In dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during flow reduction, the total myocardial mass of the ischemic "risk" zone and infarcted zone was significantly greater than in those without spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (68 +/- 5% versus 56 +/- 6% [p less than 0.01]). There was no difference in the total myocardial mass of the ischemic risk zone and infarcted zone between dogs with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia during flow reduction. CONCLUSIONS. In canine model of subacute myocardial infarction, superimposed ischemia increased the likelihood of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia with lesser grades of coronary flow reduction compared with that necessary to allow spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. The underlying pathophysiology appears to differ between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and electrically induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. 
Prevention of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, multicenter trial comparing norfloxacin with ciprofloxacin. The GIMEMA Infection Program. Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in preventing bacterial infection in neutropenic patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Adjuvant whole-abdominal radiation therapy in uterine papillary serous carcinoma. Nine patients from 34 to 74 years of age (median, 67 years of age) with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) were treated with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (WART) on an adjuvant basis after cytoreductive surgery. All patients were treated with megavoltage photons to an abdominopelvic field to a median dose of 2500 cGy, with continued treatment to a whole pelvic field to a median dose of 4500 cGy. Three patients received additional boost to the vaginal apex. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 31 months (median, 25 months) after completion of WART. Six patients had recurrent disease at 5 to 20 months (median, 7.5 months). Four of these patients died of their disease during the follow-up period. Three of six patients in whom treatment failed had disease at the vaginal apex. None of these patients received boost radiation therapy to that site. In contrast, two of three patients remaining disease free were treated with additional vaginal apex irradiation. Based on these results, the authors do not routinely recommend WART for adjuvant treatment of UPSC. They do, however, recommend vaginal apex irradiation for these patients. 
Increased plasma endothelin-1 in the early hours of acute myocardial infarction. Endothelin is a novel endothelium-derived vasoactive peptide with potent vasoconstrictor action in the coronary bed; however, its possible contribution to myocardial ischemia and infarction is not known. Plasma endothelin-1 concentration was measured with use of a radioimmunoassay in serial venous samples from 22 patients over a 72 h period after acute myocardial infarction (14 patients with uncomplicated infarction [group I] and 8 patients with hemodynamic or ischemic sequelae [group II]). Twenty-two normal subjects and seven patients with stable angina served as the control subjects. Endothelin-1 levels in patients with stable coronary disease were not different from those of normal subjects (0.62 +/- 0.56 and 0.76 +/- 0.38 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, plasma levels of endothelin-1 rose sharply after myocardial infarction, reaching a peak of 4.95 +/- 0.78 pg/ml at 6 h after the onset of chest pain (p less than 0.05 compared with values in control subjects) and returning rapidly toward the normal range by 24 h. Patients with complicated infarction (group II) demonstrated a similar rapid increase in plasma endothelin-1 to a peak value of 8.29 +/- 1.95 pg/ml; however, plasma endothelin-1 remained elevated in these patients, becoming significantly different from values in group I at 48 and 72 h. There was no correlation between peak increases in creatine kinase and peak endothelin-1 in either group, suggesting that the stimulus for elevation of endothelin-1 was not myocardial necrosis itself. Furthermore, left ventricular ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in endothelin-1 in group I patients, whereas there was a significant inverse relation between ventricular function and plasma endothelin-1 in group II. 
Legionella myositis. Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients. A few cases have been associated with neuropathy. The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle. We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism. 
Lichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy. 
Plantar fasciitis. Etiology, treatment, surgical results, and review of the literature. Plantar fasciitis is a common orthopedic syndrome among athletes and nonathletes. The etiology of the pain is multifactorial but usually involves inflammation and degeneration of the plantar fascia origin. The majority of patients will respond to conservative measures. Surgical treatment is reserved for those patients who do not respond. A complete plantar fascia release is performed through a medial longitudinal incision. Prominent heel spurs and degenerated areas in the plantar fascia are resected. Of 27 surgically treated cases followed from one to three years, satisfactory results were obtained in 24 cases. Histologically, localized fibrosis or granulomatous changes or both were noted in several cases. 
Creatine kinase isoenzyme band mimicking CK MB on agarose gel electrophoresis. The authors report the case of an 80-year-old man with prostatic disease whose serum contained an aberrant band in the MB position on agarose gel electrophoresis of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes. The authors demonstrated that the band probably was CK BB; the patient had no evidence of myocardial infarction. Contrary to most previous reports of such cases, the aberrant enzyme did not appear to be linked with IgG, IgA, or IgM; it also did not behave as if attached to a chelatable cation. Care must be taken to avoid mistaking such bands for CK MB. 
Does cigarette smoking have an independent effect on coronary heart disease incidence in the elderly? In order to evaluate the effects of cigarette smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD) in elderly persons in the Honolulu Heart Program, 1,394 men between ages 65 and 74 were followed during an average 12-year period for new cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Incidence rates increased progressively in individuals classified at baseline as never, former, and current smokers, respectively. The absolute excess risk associated with cigarette smoking was nearly twice as high in elderly compared with middle-aged men. 
Muscle mitochondrial DNA in encephalomyopathy and ragged red fibres: a Southern blot analysis and literature review. Various mitochondrial DNA abnormalities have been described in patients with encephalomyopathies. We performed Southern blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA in nine adult patients with clinical features and ragged red fibres suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Two patients with encephalomyopathy and two with the MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres) had the normal PvuII restriction pattern of muscle mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data. 
Acute positive inotropic intervention: the phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors that are selective for cAMP-specific cardiac and vascular PDE III comprise a new group of agents for the treatment of heart failure, which at present are limited to clinical shortterm intravenous use and research uses only. Although both intravenous amrinone and milrinone are FDA approved, only amrinone is available for general clinical use. Selective phosphodiesterase inhibition produces beneficial actions of positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation that result from increased cardiac and vascular muscle concentrations of intracellular cAMP and ionic calcium. In addition, a positive lusitropic action (enhancement of cardiac relaxation) has been observed. Neither beta-adrenergic agonist activity nor inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase is produced by these agents. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement generally exceeds that of the cardiac glycosides and is comparable with that of intravenous catecholamines such as dobutamine. The different pharmacodynamic profile of the PDE inhibitors is additive to the effects of cardiac glycosides, complementary and synergistic to the actions of catecholamines, and has been shown to have favorable effects on coronary hemodynamics. As a result there is continued enthusiasm for the short-term intravenous use of amrinone and potentially milrinone in the setting of acute heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction (after myocardial infarction, open heart surgery, or infectious or toxic myocarditis), heart failure resulting from right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and when patients with severe heart failure await cardiac transplantation. Initiation of treatment with an intravenous bolus followed by a maintenance infusion provides prompt increases in stroke volume and cardiac output and simultaneous reductions in right and left ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. 
Consequences of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl [published erratum appears in Public Health Rep 1991 May-Jun;106(3):352] The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), on April 26, 1986, was the first major nuclear power plant accident that resulted in a large-scale fire and subsequent explosions, immediate and delayed deaths of plant operators and emergency service workers, and the radioactive contamination of a significant land area. The release of radioactive material, over a 10-day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (reactive depressions, post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion. 
Spontaneous near disappearance of bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas. Although coronary artery fistula is a relatively rare anomaly, it sometimes develops with advancing age, requiring surgical removal. We report a unique case of a patient whose bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas nearly disappeared in the course of four years. This case is interesting in view of recognizing one of the natural courses of this entity. 
Cerebral blood flow changes in migraine: methods, observations and hypotheses. A number of basically different methods have been used in studies of the cerebrovascular changes which occur in migraine and each individual set of findings seems to be dependent on which method is used. One method on its own can only disclose a part of all the pathophysiological events. This review is an attempt to consider the capabilities of each method and to bring together the results from different studies on migraine in order to create a complete picture of the cerebrovascular changes which occur during the course of a migraine attack. 
Pulmonary oedema after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. We report a case of pulmonary oedema which developed after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The patient was a 52-yr-old woman undergoing craniotomy for an acoustic neuroma. Anaesthesia was uneventful. Spontaneous ventilation resumed after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Following extubation she showed signs of airway obstruction and dyspnoea. The trachea was reintubated but she became hypoxic, PaO2-36 mmHg, produced pink frothy secretions and the x-ray was typical of pulmonary oedema. The oedema cleared within 24 hr. Tracheostomy was performed one week later as the cords were still fixed, but the latter had recovered by three months and the tracheostomy was closed. The cause of the cord paralysis is unknown but probably was a result of surgical trauma to the brain stem. 
Progression of coronary atherosclerosis: is coronary spasm related to progression? A total of 239 patients undergoing serial coronary angiography with a concomitant ergonovine provocation test were studied between July 1974 and June 1987. The progression of coronary artery disease was evaluated in relation to risk factors, especially coronary artery spasm. Patients were classified into three groups: 1) new myocardial infarction group (39 patients); 2) progression without infarction group (90 patients); and 3) nonprogression group (110 patients). To assess how risk factors and coronary spasm are related to the occurrence of new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction, 11 variables in the three groups were examined: age, gender, the time interval between the studies, fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test. Multiple regression analysis selected three independent predictors of progression without infarction: cholesterol (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis also selected three independent predictors of the occurrence of new myocardial infarction: fasting blood sugar (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). A positive response to the ergonovine provocation test was the strongest factor for occurrence of both new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction. To evaluate segmental arterial changes, 3,275 coronary artery segments were analyzed in the 239 patients. 
Reductions in cirrhosis deaths in the United States: associations with per capita consumption and AA membership. Cirrhosis mortality and morbidity rates have declined in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., in recent years. Previous research in Canada and Europe suggests that these declines are linked to changes in per capita consumption of alcohol and changes in the availability and/or utilization of services to reduce abusive drinking (e.g., treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous). In this study, changes in cirrhosis death rates in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia between 1974 and 1983 were regressed onto changes in per capita consumption (1974-83). AA membership (1974-83) and alcoholism treatment (1979-82). No significant relationship between treatment and cirrhosis changes was observed; however, the measure of change in treatment may not reflect the full extent of changes that occurred in the 1974-83 period. As predicted, decreases in per capita consumption and increases in AA membership were significantly associated with decreases in cirrhosis rates. 
Severe, symptomatic, dose-limiting hypophosphatemia induced by hepatic arterial infusion of recombinant tumor necrosis factor in patients with liver metastases. Twenty-two patients with liver metastases received 45 courses of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) by hepatic arterial infusion in doses ranging from 12.5 to 175 micrograms/m2/d for 5 days by continuous infusion. The induction of statistically significant, dose-related, severe, albeit transient, hypophosphatemia (less than 1.0 mg/dl) associated with clinically significant, right-sided myocardial dysfunction and severe lassitude was observed. These side effects were promptly reversed after rTNF was stopped and intravenous phosphate supplementation was started. As no significant or consistent increase in urinary phosphate excretion was detected, the rTNF-induced hypophosphatemia probably resulted from an intracellular shift of phosphate. Since tumor regression was clearly associated with the lowest levels of serum phosphate, hypophosphatemia may be important in the antitumor effects of rTNF. 
Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma: an additional component of Carney's complex. Report of a case. The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed. Review of previous history and pathologic material further supported the diagnosis. The authors conclude that recognition of each component as part of the syndrome is of crucial importance, because it may prevent a fatal outcome. A family screening program should be performed in each case. 
Lower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography. Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period. In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months. In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft. Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis. Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully. An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion. The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%. At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow. 
Ulcerative colitis in the autotransplanted neovagina. A 33-year-old woman had undergone a radical surgical excision for carcinoma of the vagina at age 11. Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens. 
Effect of interferon administration on serum hepatitis C virus RNA in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus RNA as detected by reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction was monitored in 16 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. Hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable after 4 to 8 wk of interferon administration in 13 of the 16 patients. During 6 mo of follow-up, 5 of the 13 patients who became negative for hepatitis C virus RNA after interferon administration remained negative, and all five continued to have normal ALT levels. Repeat liver biopsy in these five patients revealed histological improvement. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, which was initially positive in all treated patients, fell to undetectable levels in three of the five patients. In contrast, aminotransferase levels rose again in all eight patients who had become hepatitis C virus RNA negative but had again exhibited hepatitis C virus RNA after completion of therapy. In 16 untreated patients, hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable. These results indicate that detection of hepatitis C virus RNA may be useful as a marker of viral replication in chronic hepatitis C; they also suggest that interferon should again be administered to patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA negative on treatment but again exhibit this marker of viral replication when treatment is stopped. 
Partial hypoparathyroidism. A variant of transient congenital hypoparathyroidism. We encountered three children who had neonatal hypocalcemia followed by a period of normocalcemia and recurrence of hypocalcemia later in childhood. They were full-term infants with normal birth weights who developed hypocalcemia within the first 48 hours after birth. The hypocalcemia resolved in 1 week, 3 months, and 14 months in the three patients. The recurrences of hypocalcemia occurred at 4, 7, and 12 years of age. Their plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations were consistently low but detectable. We suggest that partial hypoparathyroidism is the underlying abnormality in these patients and that neonatal hypocalcemia in otherwise healthy infants indicates the need for calcium measurements during childhood and adolescence. 
Comparison of the aortic homograft and the pulmonary autograft for aortic valve or root replacement in children. To assess late results of aortic homograft and pulmonary autograft valves implanted into the left ventricular outflow tract of children, we reviewed the case histories of 146 patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent aortic valve or root replacement between November 1964 and April 1990. One hundred three patients (mean, 12 +/- 3.9 years) received an aortic homograft and 43 (mean, 14 +/- 4.1 years) had their own pulmonary valve transferred to the aortic position. There were 54 valve and 49 root replacements with homografts and 36 valve and seven root replacements with autografts. Hospital mortality rate was 15.5% (16 patients) in the homograft group and 11.6% (five patients) in the autograft group. Survivors were followed up for a total of 867 (homograft) and 297 (autograft) patient-years. The late mortality rate was 16.7% (1.9% per patient-year) for patients with homografts and 13.2% (4.4% per patient-year) for patients with autografts, whereas the incidence for reoperation per patient-year was 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively. At 15 years actuarial rates for homografts and autografts for freedom from reoperation were 54% +/- 8.1% and 68% +/- 11.1%; freedom from endocarditis, 97% +/- 2.4% and 75% +/- 10.2%; and freedom from any complication, 41% +/- 6.5% and 50% +/- 10.3%. Valve degeneration occurred in 19 homografts (2.2% per patient-year), whereas there was no definite instance of primary tissue failure among the pulmonary autografts. This experience would indicate that either the homograft or the autograft valve can be used with acceptable results in children. However, the pulmonary autograft gives better long-term performance and, if growth potential is realized, may be the ideal valve substitute in children. 
The relationship of sodium balance and concomitant diuretic therapy to blood pressure response with calcium channel entry blockers. Marked heterogeneity exists in the response of blood pressure to specific antihypertensive agents. In general, a single therapeutic agent can be expected to provide an adequate blood pressure response in 40% to 60% of hypertensive patients. The addition of a second agent usually extends the response rate to over 85%. The addition of a diuretic to nondiuretic regimens often produces an additive blood pressure-lowering effect. However, calcium channel entry blockers (CCBs) may be an exception, as diuretics do not appear to improve these agents' efficacy. CCBs have a dual mechanism for blood pressure reduction. In addition to their vasodilatory actions, they also promote diuresis and natriuresis. These features account for the striking efficacy of these agents when used as monotherapy in hypertensive patients. Studies have shown that dietary sodium restriction does not appear to improve the efficacy of CCBs, nor is a high-salt diet predictive of a better therapeutic outcome. Recent studies also indicate that the addition of a diuretic to a CCB does not produce a significant or consistent additive antihypertensive effect. Because CCBs do not produce the typical responses of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system to sodium/volume depletion, their diuretic and natriuretic effects do not result in the same adverse metabolic consequences as experienced with traditional diuretic therapy. 
Fibrin fragment D-dimer and fibrinogen B beta peptides in plasma as markers of clot lysis during thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The validity of markers in plasma of in vitro thrombolysis was investigated in 12 patients with extensive fibrinogen breakdown (greater than 80%, group 1) and in 12 patients with minimal breakdown (less than 20%, group 2). The patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in the "Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction II" (TIMI II) trial. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels were measured with two variant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), both using a fibrin fragment D-dimer specific capture antibody. In one instance, a tag antibody was used that cross-reacts with fibrinogen (pan-specific tag ELISA); in the other, the tag antibody was specific for fibrin fragment D (fibrin-specific tag ELISA). Apparent concentrations of cross-linked fibrin degradation products at baseline were within normal limits with both assays in most patients. At 8 hours after rt-PA infusion, the measured cross-linked fibrin degradation products were increased about twofold to fourfold in group 2 with both assays. However, in group 1, levels were significantly higher with the pan-specific tag ELISA (5.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/mL) compared with the fibrin-specific tag ELISA (1.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL). This observation was most likely a result of detection of fibrinogen degradation products in the pan-specific ELISA. Apparent levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42, a marker of fragment X formation, increased during thrombolysis from 4.2 +/- 2.8 pmol/mL to 2,000 +/- 230 pmol/mL in group 1 and from 4.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/mL to 300 +/- 43 pmol/mL in group 2, and were correlated significantly with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown (r = -0.8). Fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels increased from 4.3 +/- 3 pmol/mL to 70 +/- 19 pmol/mL in group 1, but did not increase in group 2. The apparent increase in group 1 could be explained by cross-reactivity of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 in the fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 assay. We conclude that cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels as measured with a pan-specific tag ELISA and fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels as measured with certain monoclonal antibody-based ELISA are influenced by the extent of fibrinogen degradation. Fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 is a marker specific for fibrinogen breakdown. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels, measured with a fibrin-specific tag ELISA, appear to be markers specific for thrombolysis. Consequently, assays similar to the fibrin-specific tag ELISA may provide more accurate information when correlated with clinical endpoints. 
Management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma. The surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. Forty cases (41 ears) of labyrinthine fistulas were reviewed. This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula. Operative management is described. 
Catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The parabrachial nucleus is believed to play a role in autonomic regulation. We have used the Fontana-Masson ammoniacal silver nitrate method and a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunostaining technique to demonstrate the presence of neuromelanin-containing catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals. In addition, we also show that there is a significant reduction of these catecholaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies in the parabrachial nucleus of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings may be related to the several autonomic disturbances that may occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
A loading dose/continuous infusion schedule of fludarabine phosphate in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Using a loading dose/continuous infusion schedule, fludarabine phosphate was administered to 51 patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). All patients had evidence of active disease, and the majority had advanced Rai stages. Of the 42 patients assessable for response, 22 (52%) achieved a partial response, five (12%) had stable disease, and 15 (36%) progressed. Thirteen of the 22 responders improved their Rai stages with fludarabine therapy, including six patients who achieved stage 0. Response rates for pretreatment stages III and IV were 60% and 53%, respectively. Patients with final Rai stages 0 to II had better survival than those with stages III and IV. Patients who had undergone splenectomy before starting therapy were more likely to respond. Myelosuppression was the primary toxicity and did not appear to be cumulative. Severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although infrequent, were associated with several deaths in the early cycles of treatment. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with no serious neurotoxicity noted. Infections were common with 22 minor, 18 major, and 10 fatal episodes. Fludarabine phosphate by this alternative dosing schedule is effective in refractory advanced CLL and is well tolerated by the majority of patients. 
Response to tumor necrosis factor in two cases of psoriasis. A 70-year-old woman was treated for renal cell carcinoma with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, 450,000 U/m2 of body surface area, daily for 5 days, once a month. She had had psoriasis for 25 years. After two courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor her psoriasis resolved. A 40-year-old man with severe psoriasis was subsequently treated with a total of seven complete and incomplete 5-day courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor at doses of 50,000 to 300,000 U/m2/day. Significant toxicity (fever, chills, hypertension, and hypotension) was encountered. Partial resolution of the lesions was seen. Tumor necrosis factor is an active agent in psoriasis. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha and indomethacin in hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. Effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. We treated a 68-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver associated with moderate hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids. 
The effects of adenotonsillectomy on growth in young children. A history of poor weight gain can often be elicited in young children with chronic upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth. 
Oral almitrine in treatment of acute respiratory failure and cor pulmonale in patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. The effects of oral almitrine bismesylate, a respiratory stimulant that acts on peripheral arterial chemoreceptors, was studied in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and hypoxaemic cor pulmonale. Twenty three patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of ventilatory failure were randomised to receive either almitrine 100 mg twice a day reducing to 50 mg twice a day over 48 hours or placebo in addition to conventional treatment. On admission the mean (SE) values for blood gas tensions were PaO2 4.8 (0.3) and PaCO2 7.7 (0.3) kPa in the 12 patients who received almitrine and PaO2 4.9 (0.1) and PaCO2 7.6 (0.3) kPa in the 11 who received placebo. After three hours of oxygen therapy at 1 1/min there was a similar rise in PaO2 in both groups, 6.4 (0.2) kPa in those receiving almitrine and 6.6 (0.4) kPa in those receiving placebo. After 24 hours of oxygen therapy values of PaO2 were again similar at 6.3 (0.8) kPa and 6.7 (2.2) kPa respectively. Arterial blood gas tensions improved during the study in those who survived but no significant differences were apparent between the two groups. There were six deaths, five in the almitrine group and one in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory rate, results of spirometry, oxygen requirement, or degree of dyspnoea (on visual analogue scale). The results did not show any benefit from oral almitrine in patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease. Plasma almitrine concentrations, however, were often below the optimum therapeutic range, suggesting impaired drug absorption. 
Medication-induced esophageal injury: report of 17 cases with endoscopic documentation. We report on medication-induced esophageal injury (MIEI) in 17 patients (six male, 11 female) seen from October 1986 to May 1990. The mean age of patients was 27.3 (SD = 5.7) yr; mean duration of drug ingestion prior to the occurrence of symptoms 10.2 (SD = 11.5) days, and mean duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention 4.6 (SD = 3.8) days. Symptoms subsided after treatment, with a mean of 6 (SD = 2.5) days. Symptoms included odynophagia (in 17), chest pain (six), epigastric pain (three), and retrosternal pain (one). Symptoms occurred after the drug was stopped in three. MIEI was caused by doxycycline (seven), minocycline (five), Pantozyme (one), cloxacillin (one), unknown (two), and dicloxacillin + Danzen (one). Reclining after drug ingestion was the predominant risk factor. Endoscopy showed most ulcers to be multiple and at midesophagus. Barium swallows done in two patients were negative. There is no previous report of Pantozyme (pancreatic enzyme), Danzen (serratio-peptidase), cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin causing MIEI. 
Developing a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment. A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders. Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital. 
Human interleukin-9: genomic sequence, chromosomal location, and sequences essential for its expression in human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed human T cells. We have isolated the genomic sequence of human interleukin-9 (IL-9) based on its sequence homology with a human IL-9 cDNA isolated from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed T cells by expression cloning. The entire genomic sequence has been determined and the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The human IL-9 gene is mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5 at band 5q31-32, a region found to be deleted in a number of patients with acquired 5q- abnormalities and hematologic disorders. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequences have been identified at the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene that may play an important role in the control of IL-9 gene expression. The 5'-regulatory region of the human IL-9 gene also contains sequences identified in the 5'-flanking regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other T-cell growth factor genes including IL-2 and IL-6. The IL-9 gene is constitutively expressed in the HTLV-I-transformed human T cells and the expression of IL-9 in these cells can be further induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. Transient transfection analysis using the plasmid containing the 5'-flanking region of IL-9 gene upstream from the firefly luciferase ciferase report gene indicated that the 0.9-kb Smal-Sacl fragment of the IL-9 gene contains sequences required for the constitutive and activated expression of IL-9 gene in HTLV-I-transformed cells. These results will now allow us to study the regulatory mechanism of IL-9 gene expression in normal and leukemic human T cells. 
Randomized controlled trial of prophylactic rifampin for peritoneal dialysis-related infections. Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent rifampin, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned 64 patients to receive either rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months or no treatment. The rifampin-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in rifampin-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in rifampin-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of rifampin in four patients. We conclude that intermittent rifampin administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population. 
Dissecting the primary causes of genetic hypertension in rats. Blood pressure has a genetic component influenced by several to many genetic loci in both humans and animals; that is, blood pressure is a polygenic trait. Ultimately, the primary causes of genetic hypertension can only be established with genetic techniques. The primary tools for this analysis in animals are inbred strains of rodents selectively bred for differences in blood pressure and the genetic analysis of these strains by cosegregation techniques. This analysis determines whether it is possible to separate specific alleles at a candidate genetic locus from a component of blood pressure in genetically segregating populations. If the candidate alleles cosegregate with a component of blood pressure, these alleles must be the cause of the blood pressure differences or be linked on the same chromosome to alleles at other loci that cause blood pressure differences. If, on the other hand, the candidate alleles do not cosegregate with blood pressure, they cannot be the cause of the blood pressure differences. This analysis is straightforward in the case of a single-locus Mendelian candidate trait but is less informative if a candidate trait is itself polygenic. In this case, genetic analysis yields either 1) results that are compatible with, but not definitive proof for, a genetic role of the trait in causing blood pressure differences or 2) results that eliminate the trait as a cause of genetic differences in blood pressure. A complete listing of all the traits that have undergone genetic cosegregation analysis in rodents is given. 
The diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy using an algometer. Thirty-three patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were studied prospectively to ascertain the pressure-pain threshold of affected and unaffected limbs. The affected side had a lower threshold which was found to be statistically significant. In all 18 patients with upper limb involvement, the pain threshold was reduced on the affected side, but this applied to only 11 of the 15 with leg involvement. This difference may be because patients with lower limb symptoms had been referred later in the course of the syndrome. We showed by repeated tests that after an average of 49 days there was a slow return to normality. The estimation of pressure-pain thresholds may help in the earlier diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. 
Mesh-constricted varicose and dilated veins used as arterial bypass grafts. To avoid non-autogenous vascular prostheses in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, otherwise unusable dilated, varicose or thin-walled veins can be implanted as naturally endothelialized grafts after being calibrated by insertion into mesh tubes. In six sheep the 14 mm diameter jugular vein was inserted into a 12 cm long, 6 mm diameter Dacron mesh tube and implanted as a femoropopliteal graft. On the contralateral side the femoral vein with a maximal diameter of 7 to 8 mm was implanted. At control angiography after two months all grafts were patent, none of the wrapped grafts showed wrinkles or signs of anastomotic hyperplasia. Segments of wrapped veins were casted in paraffin under physiological pressure and cut transversely. In all cases the vein wall was pressed against the mesh tubes without forming folds. Mesh-wrapped varicose veins were used for three femorocrural and seven femoropopliteal reconstructions. All grafts showed a smooth flow surface at control angiography. Indentations occurred only at sites where thick-walled side branches had been ligated rather than oversewn. One popliteo-pedal reconstruction occluded after two months and one patient with a crural reconstruction died two months after surgery with a patent graft. The remaining grafts were patent after 11 (2-32) months. Oversized veins can be considerably constricted by tubes without forming wrinkles. By this technique varicose veins can be used as bypass grafts and in general vein grafts can be matched in size to the recipient vessel. 
Outcome in children who nearly drown: a British Isles study OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed. 
Increasing breast cancer screening among the medically underserved--Dade County, Florida, September 1987-March 1991. Efforts to detect breast cancer at early stages are critical in reducing breast cancer-associated mortality. However, in the United States, different barriers (e.g., lack of insurance, limited access to medical care, and limited awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment) prevent certain groups from using early detection services. To promote early detection of breast cancer among an estimated 67,000 medically underserved women aged greater than or equal to 40 years, the Early Detection Program (EDP) was begun in Dade County, Florida, in the fall of 1987 (1).

Outcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation. Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. 
Inner ear damage secondary to diabetes mellitus. I. Changes in adolescent SHR/N-cp rats. The association between diabetes mellitus and hearing impairment has been debated in many previous studies. The spontaneous hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat has been shown to be a unique genetic model for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Seventeen diabetic and 17 control young male rats were divided into groups according to diet and phenotype. The rats were fed either 54% of sucrose or 54% starch diets for 3.5 months and killed at 5 months. The cochleas were fixed, decalcified, dissected, and stained for hair cell counting. A significant loss of outer hair cells was noted in the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals when compared with the control obese (LA/N-cp) animals in every group. Although no significant difference was noted between the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals receiving the starch and sugar diets, the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals were more severely affected than the nondiabetic lean (SHR/N-cp) rats. 
Cortical benzodiazepine receptor binding in patients with generalized and partial epilepsy. Impaired cortical inhibition may be involved in epileptogenic mechanisms. In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated a reduction of the cortical benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epileptic seizures. In the present study, we used the same method in 10 patients with primary generalized epilepsy to determine whether an altered BZD receptor binding could also be demonstrated in this patient group. The [11C]-labeled BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was used as ligand. Receptor affinities and densities were calculated in various cortical regions and then compared with the values from corresponding "nonepileptic" regions in the previously examined partial epilepsy patients. Focal alterations of the BZD receptor density or affinity were not demonstrated in patients with generalized epilepsy. This patient group had a slight tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density, however, as compared with corresponding values from 10 patients with partial epilepsy. Our results strongly suggest that a focal alteration of cortical inhibition is not a prominent feature of human generalized epilepsy. The observed tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density may be a consequence of diffusely impaired cortical inhibition. Further investigations of this issue are therefore indicated. 
Synthesis and evaluation of new iodine-125 radiopharmaceuticals as potential tracers for malignant melanoma. The synthesis, labeling, and biodistribution of four 125I radiopharmaceuticals designed to localize in melanoma were tested. Uptake in tumors was demonstrated by autoradiography of whole-body sections and quantitated by measurement of radioactivity of selected tissues and tumors using melanoma-bearing mice. N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-iodobenzamide was selected for its highest melanoma uptake: 60 min after IV injection of 6.5% and 4% ID/g, respectively for murine B16 and human melanotic melanoma. Tumor uptake showed the highest values of all analyzed tissues from 6 to 24 hr after injection. High uptake in melanotic tumor tissue with relatively low uptake in blood, muscle, brain, lung, and liver tissue resulted in high tumor/nontumor ratios (at 24 hr for B16, tumor/blood = 37, tumor/brain = 147, tumor/muscle = 95). This agent was compared with iodoamphetamine. Scintigraphic images of the tumor confirmed that external detection of melanoma is possible with this new radiopharmaceutical. 
Choledocholithiasis in acute gallstone pancreatitis. Incidence and clinical significance. A prospective study of choledocholithiasis was performed using 110 patients with presumptive diagnoses of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The incidence of migrating and persistent bile duct stones was determined using stool screening and intraoperative cholangiography, and the clinical significance of continued stone obstruction of the papilla was investigated using ultrasound assessment of migration time and a second evaluation of prognostic signs. Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Neither delayed migration nor persistent stone obstruction of the papilla promoted pancreatic inflammation. 
Dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The authors present three cases of dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). A literature search revealed only three previous cases. Analysis of these six cases showed a unique clinical picture. Three patients developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the other three had ischemia. All patients complained of occipital headache or neck pain, regardless of the initial symptoms. Heralding episodes were recorded in four cases. Angiography showed a characteristic fusiform dilatation of the PICA and a narrowing proximal to and distal to the lesion. Various surgical treatments were performed in five cases. Intraoperative observation showed a sausage-like swelling of the PICA or one of its branches with various discoloration depending on the age of the intramural clot. The outcomes were favorable. 
Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. 
Stromal osseous metaplasia in carcinoma of the bladder. Osseous metaplasia of the stroma of carcinomas of the bladder is a rare finding that must be distinguished from osteosarcoma and carcinosarcoma. We report a case of multifocal osseous metaplasia in a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive glandular differentiation, arising in the base of the bladder of an 84-year-old man. Reports of 11 other cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in primary bladder carcinomas and of 5 cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in metastases of bladder carcinoma are reviewed. 
Effects of interferon-gamma therapy on thyroid function, T-lymphocyte subpopulations and induction of autoantibodies. Treatment with human leucocyte interferon (IFN alpha) has been associated with the development of thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism, but it is not certain whether this phenomenon was a result of contamination with IFN gamma, which induced HLA class II antigen expression on T-lymphocytes. We prospectively studied 11 subjects (5 females and 6 males; mean age, 26.8 yr; range, 18-36) with chronic active hepatitis B who were randomized to receive recombinant human IFN gamma (rhIFN gamma; 10(6) U/m2.day, im, 3 times/week) for 16 weeks. Goiter was not present, and no patient had a history or family history of autoimmune diseases. Serial thyroid functions, including serum T4, T3, free thyroid hormone index, free T4 and TSH before, during, and on subsequent follow-up for a period of 1 yr were all normal. Eight patients had adequate serial samples for study of serological and lymphocyte subpopulations. None of the patients treated with rhIFN gamma developed thyroglobulin or thyroid microsomal antibodies. However, four patients developed antinuclear and smooth muscle autoantibodies during or after rhIFN gamma treatment. Treatment with rhIFN gamma resulted in a significant increase in circulating T-lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive T-cells (P less than 0.05), with equal proportions of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells becoming DR positive. The percentage of HLA-DR-positive T-cells remained elevated after discontinuation of rhIFN gamma. Also, rhIFN gamma treatment led to a decrease in the number of circulating granulocytes and interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells. In conclusion, we did not observe any thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity in our patients treated with the studied dose of rhIFN gamma, but induction of other autoantibodies was observed. 
Pericardial mass mimicking constrictive pericarditis. Persistent pericardial hematoma due to blunt chest trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of constricted myocardium resulting from a large, partially organized hematoma in the right cardiophrenic angle. The hematoma was assumed to be caused by an occupational accident 17 years before diagnosis. Constriction could only be controlled by complete removal of the fibrous posterior capsule of the hematoma, which covered the epicardium of the right heart. 
The effect of an extra-articular procedure on allograft reconstructions for chronic ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament. A study was performed on the effect of the addition of an extra-articular procedure involving tenodesis of the iliotibial band to a reconstruction with a bone-patellar ligament-bone allograft for the treatment of chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. One hundred and four patients were divided into two groups for comparison: Group 1 (sixty-four patients) was treated with only an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and Group 2 (forty patients), with both an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and the extra-articular procedure. Preoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of twenty variables, including body weight, level of activity, anterior-posterior displacements, number of previous operations, and duration of follow-up. All of the patients returned for follow-up evaluation twenty-three to fifty-four months (mean, thirty-five months) postoperatively. All were treated with the same postoperative program of immediate motion of the knee and rehabilitation. The results were evaluated with the use of a comprehensive subjective and objective system that rated the twenty factors. Both procedures proved to be effective in decreasing functional limitations and symptoms and in improving the level of sports activity and the over-all scores. The results in Group 2 were significantly better than those in Group 1, as measured with tests done with the KT-1000 arthrometer (p less than 0.01) and with regard to the level of sports activity (p less than 0.05) and the over-all scores (p less than 0.01). There was no postoperative difference between the two groups in terms of the results on pivot-shift or isokinetic testing, patellofemoral crepitus, functional limitations, or symptoms. The program of rehabilitation effectively restored 0 to 135 degrees of motion to all but four knees, which lacked 5 degrees of extension at the most recent follow-up. The over-all rate of failure for both groups was 11 per cent. However, the rate of failure was 16 per cent (ten of sixty-four knees) in Group 1 and only 3 per cent (one of forty knees) in Group 2. This difference was significant (p less than 0.05). The extra-articular procedure appeared to provide support to the healing intra-articular allograft by reducing deleterious forces and tibial displacements, and to restore the secondary restraints provided by the lateral iliotibial band. The results suggest that the combination of the procedures is of value in young, athletically active people who have chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Nasal administration of salmon calcitonin for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis. To determine the effect of intranasal administration of salmon calcitonin on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis, we gave 100 U of calcitonin intranasally on alternate days with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 to five children, 8 to 12 years of age, with frequently relapsing nephrosis. Four patients with osteoporosis, 10 to 14 years of age, were treated only with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and served as control subjects. Both groups were treated with an almost equal amount of glucocorticoids previously and during this study period. Bone mineral content of the spine was measured by a quantitative computed tomographic technique. The bone mineral content was preserved in both cortical and spongeous areas of the vertebrae during the 16-month period in the calcitonin-treated group but was decreased significantly in the control group. Urinary hydroxyproline and calcium excretion decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group. The serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and the parathyroid function did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that calcitonin suppressed bone resorption and might be useful for the long-term treatment of osteoporosis, in combination with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, in children with nephrosis requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy. 
Sudden unexpected death due to papillary fibroma of the aortic valve. Report of a case and review of the literature. The case of the sudden unexpected death of a 21-year-old man due to embolization of segments of an aortic valve papillary fibroma to the left main and anterior descending coronary artery is presented. The literature regarding cardiac papillary fibroma is reviewed with particular reference to those cases associated with sudden death. 
Adrenergic regulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in proximal tubules of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Increased renal nerve activity and sodium retention have been implicated in the development of hypertension in genetically transmitted forms of this disease. The present studies were designed to investigate the relationship between renal nerve integrity and renal proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of basolateral membranes (BLMs) enriched from proximal tubules of five-week-old SHR was greater, 328.6 +/- 18.9 nmol Pi/mg protein.min, than in age-matched genetic controls rats (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY, rats), 262.3 +/- 34.6 nmol Pi/mg protein.min (P less than 0.02). There was no detectable difference in (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of 13-week-old SHR and WKY rats. Prior renal denervation was associated with a reduction in proximal tubule basolateral membrane (BLM) (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, 316.8 +/- 23.8 to 223.1 +/- 23.9 nmol Pi/mg protein/min (P less than 0.02), in five-week SHR. However, denervation had no effect on renal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in either WKY rats, nor did sham-denervation in SHR. In addition, exogenous norepinephrine, 1 microM, produced a more pronounced stimulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in basolateral membranes from SHR as opposed to WKY controls (40.2% vs. 28.7%). Therefore, renal nerve integrity and exogenous catecholamines have a greater stimulatory influence on proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in the early stages (prior to 5 weeks) of the development of hypertension in SHR than in age-matched WKY rats. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A before, during, and after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with alteplase. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase. 
Coupling between the heart and arterial system in heart failure. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated the optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial load, under physiologic and pathologic circumstances, directed to produce maximal stroke work. We investigated matching of the ventricular properties, quantified by the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, with arterial load properties, expressed by the slope of end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relationship. In normal subjects, with ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 60%, ventricular elastance was nearly twice as large as arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal mechanical efficiency. In patients with moderate heart failure, with ejection fraction of 40-59%, ventricular elastance was almost equal to arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal stroke work from a given end-diastolic volume. In patients with severe heart failure, with ejection fraction of less than 40%, ventricular elastance was less than half of arterial elastance, which resulted in increased potential energy and decreased work efficiency. Ventriculoarterial coupling is normally set toward higher left ventricular work efficiency, whereas in patients with moderate cardiac dysfunction, ventricular and arterial properties are matched, in order to maximize stroke work at the expense of work efficiency. Neither the stroke work nor work efficiency is near maximum for patients with severe cardiac dysfunction. 
Nutrition and metabolism in sepsis and multisystem organ failure. Sepsis and organ failure produce profound metabolic changes that contribute to hepatic and musculoskeletal failure. When multiple organ failure develops, the mortality rate is high, and therapy is unlikely to be effective unless the causative process (e.g., infection, low cardiac output) can be eliminated. Thus, the prevention of multiple organ failure and the prevention or early treatment of infection are paramount. Organ and nutritional support to prevent complications is necessary. The gastrointestinal tract should be used for nutrition whenever possible with a blenderized regular diet with fiber, glutamine, and short-chain fatty acids to protect and preserve the gut. If parenteral nutrition is necessary, special solutions may be necessary for the liver, kidneys, or lungs. If not, protein with 45% branched-chain amino acid, medium- and short-chain triglycerides, glutamine supplementation, and carbohydrates seem best. Other substances are being evaluated that may be helpful in nutrition and organ support, including arginine, xylitol, growth hormone, and anabolic steroids. Multiple organ failure should be prevented, if at all possible, by stopping or controlling the injury, removing as much necrotic tissue as possible, improving blood flow and oxygen consumption, supporting metabolism, and preventing infection or treating it early and adequately. Nutritional support plays a key role in preventing metabolic failure. 
Reducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. 
Staple closure of the hypopharynx after diverticulectomy and total laryngectomy. The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons. Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10%), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11%), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45%). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended. 
Role for tumor necrosis factor as mediator of lung injury following lower torso ischemia. Ischemia and reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso lead to a neutrophil- (PMN) dependent lung injury characterized by PMN sequestration and permeability edema. This mimics the injury seen after infusion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), a potent activator of PMN and endothelium. This study tests whether TNF is a mediator of the lung injury after lower torso ischemia. Anesthetized rats underwent 4 h of bilateral hindlimb tourniquet ischemia, followed by reperfusion for 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (n = 6 for each time point). Quantitative lung histology indicated progressive sequestration of PMN in the lungs, 25 +/- 3 (SE) PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) 10 min after reperfusion vs. 20 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (NS), increasing to 53 +/- 5 PMN/10 HPF after 4 h vs. 23 +/- 3 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was lung permeability, shown by increasing protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, which 4 h after reperfusion was 599 +/- 91 vs. 214 +/- 35 micrograms/ml in sham animals (P less than 0.01). Similarly, there was edema, shown by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which increased by 4 h to 4.70 +/- 0.12 vs. 4.02 +/- 0.17 in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was generation of leukotriene B4 in BAL fluid (720 +/- 140 vs. 240 +/- 40 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), and in three of six rats tested at this time TNF was detected in plasma, with a mean value of 167 pg/ml. TNF was not detectable in any sham animal. 
Anaesthesia for a patient with giant axonal neuropathy. Giant axonal neuropathy is a generalised disorder of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments which particularly involves the peripheral and central nervous systems. In this paper we describe a child with giant axonal neuropathy and discuss the anaesthetic management in the light of the pathology and physiology of the condition. 
Distribution of thymic tissue in the mediastinal adipose tissue. The distribution of thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal, retrocarinal, and preaortic fat was examined histologically in 27 autopsy subjects. Thymic tissue was found in the anterior mediastinal fat in 12 subjects (44.4%), in the retrocarinal fat in two (7.4%), and in the preaortic fat in none. The finding of ectopic thymic tissue in these areas has not been reported previously, would appear to be surgically inaccessible via a median sternotomy, and may be responsible in part for some of the failures of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 
Jaundice and cholestasis. Some common and uncommon causes. Jaundiced patients may not always be as sick as they look, and cholestatic patients may be quite ill but not yet jaundiced. There is variability in presentation of cholestasis, and jaundice may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and acute or chronic. Even though the diagnosis of jaundice can be elusive, an unnecessarily exhaustive search for a cause should be avoided, because some tests are not without dangers. Dr Gordon describes many possible causes, some of which are rare but are still worth consideration. 
Colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis. Influence of anatomical extent and age at onset on colitis-cancer interval. We have examined the age at onset of both ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in 100 patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1988. There were 85 patients with extensive colitis and 15 with left sided colitis. There was a strong direct correlation between the age at onset of ulcerative colitis and age at diagnosis of cancer (p less than 0.0001); this correlation was found both in patients with extensive colitis (p less than 0.0001) and in those with left sided colitis (p less than 0.005). Patients with left sided colitis developed both their colitis and their cancers about a decade later than did those with extensive disease, but the mean duration of colitis before diagnosis of cancer was virtually the same (about 21 years) in both groups, irrespective of the age at onset of disease. 
Bilateral chylothorax. A 2.5-kg female developed bilateral chylothoraces 10 days after surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Initial conservative management consisted of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, drainage of chylous fluid and enteral feeding, but there was no diminution in loss of chyle. Ligation of the thoracic duct and pleurectomy were performed subsequently to reduce the large daily losses of chyle, amounting to nearly three times the child's circulating blood volume. Brawny oedema of the right upper quadrant of the body developed rapidly after the duct ligation and right pleurectomy. A further period of conservative treatment was required before the latter complication resolved. The literature relating to this iatrogenic complication and to fluid and nutritional losses in paediatric chylothorax is reviewed and discussed. 
Diagnosis and treatment of headache in the elderly. The diagnosis and management of some causes of headache in the elderly are reviewed. Etiologic theories have been presented for each condition. Treatment modalities include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical therapies. The treatment course set forth in this article can help the clinician provide proper relief for the patient in pain. 
Congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic atrioventricular valve: association with aortic arch obstruction. Aortic arch abnormalities are uncommon in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Over a 20-year period, 10 patients with congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve were identified. Five neonates had severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with severe coarctation of the aorta (n = 4) or aortic atresia (n = 1) and presented with heart failure. Four died in the neonatal period and one who had coarctation repair died 7 months postoperatively. The remaining five patients with congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly had mild left AV valve regurgitation; none of these had aortic arch obstruction. In neonates who have coexisting Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic AV valve and congenitally corrected transposition, obstruction to aortic arch flow is common. Severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with a morphologic systemic right ventricle may have contributed to low anterograde flow in the ascending aorta prenatally and thereby to the aortic arch abnormality. 
Adenocarcinoma: an unusual presentation. A young pregnant woman had facial swelling in the upper nasal region. This was initially considered to be lymphedema in view of a history of past severe facial acne. A biopsy was done when the lesion progressed; the specimen showed adenocarcinoma. This responded well to radiotherapy, the favorable response being maintained for more than 24 months. 
Indications for modification of coexisting dual atrioventricular node pathways in patients undergoing surgical ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections Concomitant susceptibility to atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia has been demonstrated in certain patients having reentrant tachycardia utilizing accessory AV connections. For those patients undergoing accessory connection ablation, AV node surgical modification may be warranted during the same operative procedure. To assess indications for a combined operative procedure, this study evaluated potential predictors of subsequent spontaneous AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients undergoing ablation of accessory AV connections. Among 62 consecutive patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection, 13 (21%) manifested dual AV node pathways. The latter were identified preoperatively in five patients (four with concealed and one with bidirectional accessory connections) and postoperatively in seven (all seven with bidirectional accessory connections). In one patient with a bidirectional accessory connection, dual AV node pathways could not be demonstrated preoperatively, but AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced. Operative ablation of an accessory connection was successful in all patients. However, postoperatively, 2 of the 13 patients had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, 5 had AV node "echo" beats and 6 had no inducible arrhythmia. During 26 +/- 7 months of follow-up study, the two patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia postoperatively had symptomatic AV node reentrant tachycardia. In addition, the one patient with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia preoperatively had recurrence of this tachycardia 4 months after attempted surgical modification of the AV node. Consequently, although dual AV node pathways appear to be common in patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection (21%), only a small group (3 of 13) of these patients are at risk for subsequent clinical AV node reentrant tachycardia. 
Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity following duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole, sucralfate, and Maalox. Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity (PCS) have been studied in 21 duodenal ulcer patients before and after successful treatment with omeprazole (n = 7), sucralfate (n = 7), or Maalox (n = 7). The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients. Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation. PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage). Ulcer healing with sucralfate resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in low-dose acid output from 36.4% (13.2-51.0) (median [range]) to 8.4% (3.2-45.4) mmol/hour and PCS from 69.1% (44.9-91.4) to 22.0% (16.0-85.6), whereas no significant decreases in any of the measured parameters were noted following ulcer healing with Maalox. Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour. These findings suggest that acid secretory responses following ulcer healing vary according to the therapeutic agent used. 
Patients with duodenitis have gastric secretory and motor functions like those of duodenal ulcer patients: results of a short-term treatment with ranitidine. Gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying of solids, and the effects of short-term treatment with 300 mg ranitidine at bedtime were evaluated in symptomatic patients with endoscopically and histologically proven duodenitis. The patients investigated had basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid hypersecretion, but normal gastric emptying times. Ranitidine brought about a significant improvement of endoscopic and histological features compared with the pretreatment findings. Endoscopic but not histological improvement was significantly better than with placebo. Furthermore, ranitidine brought about a significant reduction of weekly antacid consumption compared with placebo. Both ranitidine and placebo induced significant symptomatic improvement over basal conditions, but the difference between the two treatments did not reach statistical significance. Gastric secretory and motor functions, as well as the response to therapy, were similar in duodenitis patients with and without previous history of duodenal ulcer; the only exception was in antacid consumption, which was higher in the placebo group in those with past evidence of ulcer disease. Our results suggest that duodenitis patients have secretory and motor functions similar to those of duodenal ulcer patients. Therefore, further trials on large populations of duodenitis patients with antisecretory drugs are justified. 
Differential effects of heptanol, potassium, and tetrodotoxin on reentrant ventricular tachycardia around a fixed obstacle in anisotropic myocardium BACKGROUND. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that electrical uncoupling and depression of the fast sodium channels have differential effects on propagation of the electrical impulse relative to the fiber orientation. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a model of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) (mean cycle length, 144 +/- 13 msec) around a ring of anisotropic myocardium in 10 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, the effects of extracellular K+ concentration [( K+]o) and heptanol were studied. [K+]o and heptanol each had a dose-dependent effect on VT cycle length. However, high [K+]o slowed the VT mainly by depressing longitudinal conduction, whereas heptanol preferentially depressed transverse conduction. The ratio between longitudinal and transverse conduction velocities progressively decreased with high [K+]o and progressively increased with heptanol. Heptanol terminated VT at a mean concentration of 3.5 +/- 0.5 mM. The cycle length before termination was 446 +/- 120 msec (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 experiments, termination occurred by failure of conduction during transverse propagation. VT terminated at a mean [K+]o of 11.6 +/- 1.8 mM. The cycle length before termination was 493 +/- 341 msec (p less than 0.01). In seven of 10 cases, termination occurred by failure of conduction during longitudinal propagation. In the remaining five episodes (two with heptanol and three with high [K+]o), termination occurred by collision of the reentrant beat with an antidromic impulse being reflected within the ring. In a separate series of six hearts, tetrodotoxin was administered during VT. Like high [K+]o, tetrodotoxin prolonged the cycle length of the VT by preferentially slowing longitudinal conduction, and VT was terminated by longitudinal block. CONCLUSIONS. During reentrant VT, electrical uncoupling of cells by heptanol or modification of active membrane properties by high [K+]o or tetrodotoxin has a differential depressing effect on propagation of the impulse relative to the fiber orientation. 
Effects of alterations in pulmonary function and sleep variables on survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Breathing abnormalities and nocturnal hypoventilation occur in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A prospective study was undertaken to determine the relationship of pulmonary function test abnormalities with quality of sleep and survival in 21 patients with ALS. Results of spirometry including determination of maximal respiratory pressures and arterial blood gases were compared with several formal polysomnographic variables and then also with 18-month survival. The patients had mild to moderate pulmonary function deficits, but the quality of sleep was best related to age (mean age, 58.5 years). The results of pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas measurements did not correlate well with the presence of nocturnal breathing events or survival time, but the maximal inspiratory pressure was 86% sensitive for predicting the presence of a nocturnal oxygen saturation nadir of 80% or less and 100% sensitive for predicting 18-month survival. Although obstructive breathing events occurred, the primary explanation for the decline in nocturnal oxygen saturation was hypoventilation. We conclude that routine pulmonary function tests may be useful for screening for reductions in nocturnal oxygen saturation and also may have prognostic value. Further studies may determine whether treatment of nocturnal hypoventilation will have an effect on survival in patients with ALS who have breathing impairment. 
Transition of Ki-67 index of uterine cervical tumors during radiation therapy. Immunohistochemical study. Histopathologic and Ki-67-staining features of cancer cells were investigated in biopsy specimens before and during radiation therapy in 29 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. No morphologic changes were observed up to doses of 540 cGy. A few intact cancer cells remained up to doses of 2700 cGy. Moderate changes in the cancer cells were noticed in patients who received 900 cGy or more, i.e., multinuclei, swollen nuclei and cytoplasms, and prominent large nucleoli. At doses of 1800 cGy or greater, many cancer nests had severely damaged cancer cells with features such as cytolysis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and bizarre giant cells. There was no mitosis in the cells of patients who received doses greater than 1800 cGy. The Ki-67-positive cancer cells showed diffuse nuclear-stainings and dot-stainings before radiation therapy. Radiation doses more than 900 cGy changed the staining pattern of the Ki-67 antibody; large irregular spot-stainings and ring-stainings were observed predominantly. The Ki-67 index initially increased with the radiation dose; the mean Ki-67 indices before radiation therapy and at radiation doses of 180 cGy, 540 cGy, and 900 cGy were 41%, 50%, 63%, and 68%, respectively. The indices decreased when the dose was increased further, and they were 39% and 20% at doses of 1800 cGy and 2700 cGy, respectively. Possible explanations, including recruitment of quiescent cells, for the change in Ki-67 staining are discussed. 
Posterior fossa intracranial hemorrhage in infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: sonographic findings. Posterior fossa hemorrhage was documented by autopsy in five infants who had been treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over a 5-year-period. In all five cases, the diagnosis was made prospectively by cranial sonography. Sonographic findings were compared with those in a control group of 15 infants with normal posterior fossae at autopsy. The following sonographic abnormalities were exhibited in neonates with posterior fossae hemorrhage: loss of definition of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle on midline sagittal images, heterogeneous cerebellar parenchyma, focal hypoechoic lesions, ventricular dilatation, and tentorial abnormalities. Bright foci inferior to the third ventricle were seen in four neonates in the normal control group. These foci measured 5-10 mm in diameter. One cranial sonogram was falsely interpreted as showing a posterior fossa hemorrhage because of prominent echoes in the interpeduncular cistern. Infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are at risk for developing posterior fossa hemorrhage. Awareness of sonographic signs and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of posterior fossa hemorrhage is important for early and accurate recognition of these unusual and sometimes treatable hemorrhages. 
Positive role of Clostridium difficile infection in diarrhea in infants and children. A retrospective review of children with Clostridium difficile infection and diarrhea identified 43 patients. Fifteen (35%) had immunoglobulins below the normal range for age, and typified those with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, because all increased their levels over the following 12 months. The age of those with hypogammaglobulinemia was significantly younger (p less than 0.01), averaging 18.8 months, than those with normal immunoglobulins who had a mean age of 4.6 yr. The number with recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the hypogammaglobulinemic group than in those with normal immunoglobulins (46% vs 18%). Eleven children were identified who had C. difficile toxin in the stool after antibiotic therapy, but who had no diarrhea at the time of study. All had normal immunoglobulins. Control patients (20 without and 40 with diarrhea) had no evidence of C. difficile infection, and all but three had normal immunoglobulins. Three (7%) of those with diarrhea had IgA deficiency, and all had a diagnosis of milk protein allergy. These data suggest that immunoglobulin values be obtained in infants and children who have problematic C. difficile diarrhea in order to identify disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis which may be the underlying cause of repeated upper respiratory disease requiring antibiotic usage. 
Variable regression of experimental bronchial preneoplasia during carcinogenesis. It has been thought that squamous severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchus is reliably precancerous. The canine subcutaneous bronchial autograft model for studying the progression of epidermoid carcinogenesis (normal----regular squamous metaplasia----mild, moderate, and severe atypical metaplasia----squamous cell carcinoma) provides evidence that severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium is reversible. Among 148 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had serial sampling of the epithelium and exposure to implants of methylcholanthrene, severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 28 that received only a single implant. During the total carcinogen exposure (median 24.5 months), 9 of 28 (32%) developed squamous cell cancer, and 19 of 28 (68%) regressed toward normal. Severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 34 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that received two or more carcinogen implants: epidermoid cancer developed in 26 of 34 (76.5%), and regression toward or to normal occurred in 8 of 34 (23.5%). Severe atypical metaplasia was not detected in 53 subcutaneous bronchial autografts: 19 that received only a single implant and 34 that received two or more implants. Progression and regression occurred among these subcutaneous bronchial autografts in proportions similar to those found in subcutaneous bronchial autografts wherein severe atypical metaplasia was seen. Among 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts initially studied after 6 months of exposure to carcinogen, progression to severe atypical metaplasia was seen 3 months later in 19 of 33 that had additional exposure; in the same interval regression of epithelial abnormalities occurred in 14 of 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had no additional exposure (p less than 0.05). We have presented evidence that severe atypical metaplasia includes at least three cell populations: one committed to cancer without further stimulus, one that regresses despite further carcinogen exposure, and one that requires additional carcinogen to progress to cancer. At least in this model, severe atypical metaplasia is not inexorably precancerous. The subcutaneous bronchial autograft model is suitable for seeking biologic indicators of irreversibility. 
Spinal cord ischemia after resection of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms: MR findings in 24 patients. MR images of the thoracic spinal cord were made in 24 patients who developed signs and symptoms of spinal cord ischemia or infarction following surgery for a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Findings consisted primarily of four different patterns of signal abnormalities in the distribution of the anterior spinal artery. These abnormalities were identified as types A-D, depending on the degree of involvement of the gray matter and surrounding white matter. We found good correlation between the distribution of the signal abnormalities in the cord, the severity of the neurologic deficits, and the clinical outcome. MR is the imaging method of choice for diagnosing spinal cord ischemia or infarction. A thorough knowledge of the spinal cord arterial territories is crucial for characterizing ischemic MR signal abnormalities and for differentiating them from other causes of myelopathy. 
Predicting chemically induced duodenal ulcer and adrenal necrosis with classification trees. Binary tree-structured statistical classification algorithms and properties of 56 model alkyl nucleophiles were brought to bear on two problems of experimental pharmacology and toxicology. Each rat of a learning sample of 745 was administered one compound and autopsied to determine the presence of duodenal ulcer or adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis. The cited statistical classification schemes were then applied to these outcomes and 67 features of the compounds to ascertain those characteristics that are associated with biologic activity. For predicting duodenal ulceration, dipole moment, melting point, and solubility in octanol are particularly important, while for predicting adrenal necrosis, important features include the number of sulfhydryl groups and double bonds. These methods may constitute inexpensive but powerful ways to screen untested compounds for possible organ-specific toxicity. Mechanisms for the etiology and pathogenesis of the duodenal and adrenal lesions are suggested, as are additional avenues for drug design. 
Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat. Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora. 
Effect of clonidine on gallbladder contraction and small bowel transit time in insulin-treated diabetics. Cholelithiasis is more prevalent in diabetics than in nondiabetics. Gallbladder dysmotility is supposed to be one of the causative factors. Reduced alpha-adrenergic tone has been demonstrated in the enterocytes of diabetic rats, and its correction by clonidine might explain the beneficial effect that the drug has on diabetic diarrhea. We therefore surmised that diabetic cholecystoparesis could also be due to alpha-adrenergic alterations. To test this hypothesis, we studied gallbladder contractions by real time ultrasonography, and small bowel transit time by lactulose hydrogen breath test, in 13 insulin-requiring diabetics before and after administration of the alpha-adrenergic stimulant clonidine (0.3 mg orally). That plasma levels were sufficient was evidenced indirectly by a fall in blood pressure. Clonidine significantly improved the rate of emptying (0.0193 +/- 0.00057/min vs. 0.0318 +/- 0.0027/min; p less than 0.005), but not the fasting and residual gallbladder volumes. Small bowel transit time was significantly prolonged after clonidine (169 +/- 17 min vs. 208 +/- 17; p less than 0.05). These results suggest that 1) reduced alpha-adrenergic tone corrected by clonidine may be present in the diabetic gallbladder, and 2) clonidine's antidiarrheal effect might be explained, at least in part, by a prolongation of the small bowel transit time. 
Relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular function in patients with left ventricular volume overload due to chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. The relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular (LV) function was studied in 10 patients, aged 41 to 61 years (average 51), with LV volume overload mainly due to chronic mitral regurgitation. Beta-adrenergic receptors were examined using crude membrane in LV papillary muscle obtained at mitral valve replacement. Cardiac function was evaluated at preoperative cardiac catheterization with the interval to surgery of 1 to 33 months (average 7). Beta-adrenergic receptor density in 7 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure was higher than that in 3 patients with class IV heart failure (59 +/- 19 vs 37 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). Beta-adrenergic receptor density showed a positive correlation with end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, the index for contractile function (p less than 0.005). Other parameters such as cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and LV ejection fraction had no significant correlation to beta-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrated that increases in symptom and LV dysfunction, particularly of the contractile state, was associated with decreased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density from possible down-regulation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. 
Serum neuron-specific enolase levels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We examined serum levels of neuron-specific enolase by enzyme immunoassay in 29 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor neurological status than in patients with a good neurological status on admission, and the greater the amount of subarachnoid blood, the higher the serum neuron-specific enolase level. Patients with a good outcome had low serum neuron-specific enolase levels throughout their courses. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels increased with development of delayed ischemic neurological deficits and, especially in poor outcome patients, high levels persisted until 3 weeks after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Dopaminergic abnormalities in borderline essential hypertensive patients. To explore whether an altered metabolic pathway of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) may be related to some previously observed dopamine abnormalities in borderline hypertension, we measured basal and DOPA-induced (500 mg orally) changes in blood pressure and pulse rate as well as in three hourly plasma and urine samples. We found that borderline hypertensive patients compared with controls 1) showed a higher baseline urinary excretion of methoxytyramine, a marker of exocytotic dopamine release, with a greater DOPA-induced decrease of systolic blood pressure without reflex tachycardia; 2) had in response to DOPA a blunted plasma DOPA and free dopamine increase but an accentuated plasma dopamine sulfate and urinary DOPAC excretion; and 3) eliminated comparable quantities of dopamine in urine despite a lower rise in the glomerular DOPA load. Furthermore, although DOPA elicited natriuresis in both groups, its effect was greater in borderline hypertensive patients, who lacked the urinary sodium correlation with urinary dopamine excretion seen in control subjects. These data are compatible with increased basal exocytotic dopamine release and accelerated neuronal and renal (extraneuronal) dopamine generation from administered DOPA in borderline hypertension. The DOPA-induced hypernatriuresis exceeding augmented dopamine in borderline hypertensive patients, contrasting with the urinary sodium and dopamine correlation in control subjects, suggests that DOPA induced an additional natriuresis in borderline hypertensive patients by a decrease in renal sympathetic tone because of its central inhibition of sympathetic outflow, which also may account for the absence of reflex tachycardia. 
Amantadine toxicity presenting with complex ventricular ectopy and hallucinations. Amantadine hydrochloride is a commonly prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic range. Toxicity is related to the anticholinergic properties of the drug and primarily affects the cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems. We report the case of an adolescent who ingested 1.3 grams of amantadine and developed complex ventricular arrhythmias and altered mental status. The arrhythmias were completely suppressed with intravenous lidocaine. This case supports the hypothesis that lidocaine is effective for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias secondary to amantadine toxicity. 
Flash lamp pumped dye laser for rosacea-associated telangiectasia and erythema. The persistence of facial telangiectasis and erythema in patients with rosacea frequently presents a major cosmetic problem. It may also contribute to relapses of papular and pustular lesions. This study of 27 patients treated for their telangiectasia and erythema with a flash lamp pumped dye laser tuned at 585 nm is described. The laser gave good or excellent reduction of telangiectasia and erythema and overall appearance in 24 of the patients with between one and three treatments. In addition, papule and pustule activity was decreased in 59.2% of the patients, with those with the most severe pre-treatment activity having the most significant improvement. It is suggested that this is a useful additional form of treatment that may improve the telangiectasia and erythematous component of rosacea. 
Testing the psychogenic vomiting diagnosis. Four pediatric patients. We treated four patients with chronic vomiting during childhood in whom a tentative diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was made after an extensive evaluation. In each case, the diagnosis was reconsidered during the course of treatment, as observations about the patients and their response to interventions accumulated. In three instances, these observations did not fit those expected if the diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was correct. This led to a reexamination of the organic evaluation and the discovery of an undiagnosed organic contribution to the vomiting. In the fourth patient, gastric emptying studies confirmed that there was a strong psychological contribution to the vomiting, and helped to more carefully define this contribution. Family and individual psychotherapy and treatment were aided by the greater clarity in diagnosis. 
Strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscles from patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Intramuscular blood vessels were examined with succinate dehydrogenase stain in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from 6 patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Almost all arteries had large granular deposits with high succinate dehydrogenase activity in their walls. Electron microscopic examination of serial frozen sections of these biopsies showed that the smooth muscle cells of the strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels contained markedly proliferated mitochondria, characteristic of patients with MELAS. The presence of strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscle biopsy specimens provides an important clue toward understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanism in patients with MELAS as well as another approach to the diagnosis of this disorder. 
Study of human papillomavirus in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma in the absence of tobacco and alcohol use. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the etiology of benign and malignant mucosal lesions in both human beings and animals. The oncogenic role of HPV in malignant cervical lesions is well supported by DNA hybridization techniques and epidemiologic studies. However, the role of HPV in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma remains speculative. In this study the in situ hybridization technique was used to detect HPV genotypes 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 in tissue specimens from a study group consisting of 18 patients who were non-tobacco users, or non-tobacco and non-alcohol users, in whom oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma developed. The hybridization findings were compared with those of a comparable control group of patients with similar lesions who had a history of tobacco and alcohol use. None of the study group cases was reactive with any of the DNA probes. Two cases of the control group showed positive hybridization with HPV DNA probe types 6/11 and 16/18. The implications of these findings are presented and discussed in an attempt to clarify the role of HPV in HPV-associated oral epidermoid carcinomas. 
Abnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. 
Beriberi heart disease in a schizophrenic with an unusual diet. A 37-year-old male presented with peripheral edema of sudden onset. Other signs of heart failure were absent. Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient was a schizophrenic whose diet consisted almost entirely of carbohydrates. A clinical diagnosis of beriberi heart disease was made and the patient improved dramatically within several days of thiamine supplementation. The presentation of beriberi heart disease in developed countries is discussed. Emphasis is placed on food faddists and psychiatric patients in whom clinical findings may be subtle or absent. 
Reversal of low dose angiotension hypertension by angiotensin receptor antagonists. During acute angiotension II (Ang II) infusion (200 ng/kg/min i.v.) into anesthetized rats, mean arterial pressure rose from 124 +/- 1 to 154 +/- 2 mm Hg. The peptidic Ang II antagonist saralasin lowered arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal decrease in pressure was similar to that observed after the Ang II infusion was discontinued. The nonpeptide Ang II antagonist, 4'-[( 2-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-imidazole-1-yl] methyl) [1,1'-biphenyl] -2-carboxylic acid (SC-48742), lowered acutely elevated arterial pressure to a level similar to that on discontinuation of the angiotensin infusion. Chronic (8 days) infusion of Ang II (20 ng/kg/min i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure from 116 +/- 3 to 164 +/- 7 mm Hg, which then decreased to 121 +/- 6 mm Hg on termination of the infusion. Saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min, a maximally effective dose during acute angiotensin infusion) decreased mean arterial pressure from 168 +/- 7 to 141 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was discontinued. SC-48742 decreased mean arterial pressure from 167 +/- 7 to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure not statistically different from the minimum pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was terminated. The mechanism of blood pressure elevation during acute high dose or chronic low dose Ang II infusion is different, the latter having a significant neural component as measured by the response to trimethaphan. The peptidic antagonist saralasin was fully effective in lowering acute angiotensin hypertension but only partially effective during chronic hypertension. 
Radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility: results in 170 patients with chest pain. The role of radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with chest pain has been studied rarely. Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain. Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%). Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56). Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis. Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18. Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent. However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation. 
Junctional tachycardias: anatomic substrate and its significance in ablative procedures. The conduction system was studied by serial section in three patients with intractable supraventricular tachycardias originating from the atrioventricular (AV) junction who died suddenly. The three patients were a 6 month old girl (Case 1), a 5 month old boy (Case 2) and a 22 year old woman (Case 3). The latter had a pacemaker inserted after surgical ablation of the AV node. The heart was hypertrophied and enlarged in all. In Case 1, the AV node was partly within the central fibrous body and there was a left-sided AV bundle with acute necrosis in the summit of the ventricular septum, adjacent to the AV node and bundle. In Case 2, the coronary sinus was displaced cranially close to the central fibrous body, resulting in abnormality of the latter, with entrapment, distortion and division of the AV node and bundle into two distinct components within the central fibrous body. In Case 3, a left-sided AV node was connected to the atrial septum. The right AV node was completely interrupted by sutures and the penetrating and branching bundle and bundle branches were markedly fibrosed. In addition, the atrial septum and summit of the ventricular septum showed marked inflammatory reaction with fibrosis, which was more marked on the right ventricular side. Histologic examination of the conduction system in all three cases demonstrated congenital abnormalities of the AV junction that may be related to the tachycardia. These findings emphasize the need to carefully evaluate the atrial septum and AV junctional area, including the coronary sinus, before ablative procedures are undertaken. 
The Carney complex with ocular signs suggestive of cardiac myxoma. We treated a patient who had ophthalmic findings of the Carney complex that led to a search for and the discovery of asymptomatic cardiac myxoma. Substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with the complex because of the occurrence of cardiac myxoma. Facial and eyelid lentigines, conjunctival and caruncle pigmentation and eyelid pigmentation may precede signs or symptoms of cardiac myxoma. A study of the patient's primary relatives disclosed manifestations of the complex transmitted in a manner consistent with mendelian autosomal dominant inheritance. 
Tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata as a manifestation of miliary tuberculosis: literature review and report of a case of recurrent skin lesions. The development of severe adverse reactions to antituberculous drugs in a patient with miliary tuberculosis led to unorthodox, suboptimal antituberculous therapy. The patient's failure to respond to therapy was discovered when acid-fast bacilli were detected in new skin lesions. Such lesions have been described in the literature as tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata; 24 cases (in addition to that described herein) have been reported thus far. The patient eventually recovered completely after detection and drainage of a large retrofascial tuberculous abscess. This case illustrates the importance of careful examination of the skin in clinical medicine, as tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata is an easily overlooked sign of miliary tuberculosis. 
Importance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. 
Early experience with the smart laser in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusions. A dual-laser system (helium-cadmium and pulsed dye) capable of continuous computer analysis of spectroscopic characteristics of tissue fluorescence, which can distinguish atherosclerotic plaque from components of normal arterial wall, was used to deliver laser energy to ablate plaque. During a 1-year period this system was used to facilitate balloon angioplasty of short (3 to 17 cm) total occlusions of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries only when standard angioplasty techniques were ineffective. During the year of the study, in one institution 415 patients were subjected to arteriography of the lower extremities for leg ischemia (397 for limb salvage indications). Standard angioplasty techniques were used in 94 of these patients; 218 patients were unsuitable for standard angioplasty, did not fulfill criteria for "smart" laser treatment, and underwent standard bypass operations. Only 11 patients (plus six others in the second institution) requiring treatment fulfilled the criteria for use of the "smart" laser. In 10 patients the occluding lesion was traversed by the laser wire (diameter 0.021 inch), and luminal patency was effectively restored by balloon angioplasty to greater than or equal to 70% of the most normal-appearing segment of that artery. Satisfactory luminal patency has persisted for 2 to 12 months (mean 6 months) in nine patients; the lesion in the tenth patient restenosed at 3 months. The laser procedure was unsuccessful in all three patients with occlusions greater than 10 cm and in four others. Although there were three microperforations with the laser wire, there were no clinically significant complications. 
The cubital tunnel and ulnar neuropathy. The anatomy of the cubital tunnel and its relationship to ulnar nerve compression is not well documented. In 27 cadaver elbows the proximal edge of the roof of the cubital tunnel was formed by a fibrous band that we call the cubital tunnel retinaculum (CTR). The band is about 4 mm wide, extending from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon, and perpendicular to the flexor carpi ulnaris aponeurosis. Variations in the CTR were classified into four types. In type 0 (n = 1) the CTR was absent. In type Ia (n = 17), the retinaculum was lax in extension and taut in full flexion. In type Ib (n = 6) it was tight in positions short of full flexion (90 degrees to 120 degrees). In type II (n = 3) it was replaced by a muscle, the anconeus epitrochlearis. The CTR appears to be a remnant of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle and its function is to hold the ulnar nerve in position. Variations in the anatomy of the CTR may explain certain types of ulnar neuropathy. Its absence (type 0 CTR) permits ulnar nerve displacement. Type Ia is normal and does not cause ulnar neuropathy. Type Ib can cause dynamic nerve compression with elbow flexion. Type II may be associated with static compression due to the bulk of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle. 
Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In a group of 236 very low birth weight (VLBW) surviving infants, 60 had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the nursery. When compared with the 176 infants without BPD, infants with BPD were smaller, more immature, with lower one- and five-minute Apgar scores. Infants with BPD had a greater incidence of cardio-pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) complications in the nursery. On follow-up, 25 (42%) of these infants were abnormal developmentally compared to 7% of infants without BPD (p less than .001). When comparisons were made within the group of infants with BPD, very few differences were found in maternal or infant risk factors between the normal and abnormal infants. The infants with BPD who had poor outcome more often had seizures and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The infants with BPD who had good outcome were more often small for gestational age (SGA) and resuscitated with intubation at birth. They had apnea in the nursery more frequently than did abnormal infants with BPD. We conclude that VLBW infants with BPD are at greater risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome than those without BPD. The risk for the infant with BPD relates to CNS complications rather than to chronic lung disease. 
Postoperative pulmonary edema in young, athletic adults. Pulmonary edema secondary to postextubation laryngospasm is a potentially life-threatening problem, demanding early diagnosis and prompt treatment. We believe that this problem has been grossly underestimated in its incidence, as only seven adults have been reported in the English literature, whereas seven adults have been observed at our institution in only a 24 month period. All were young, healthy, athletic adult males (average weight, 218 pounds) who underwent relatively minor, uncomplicated surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Five of these patients were collegiate and/or professional athletes and had meticulous medical records detailing their clinical course. Clinical laryngospasm was noted immediately following extubation and anesthesia by mask with subsequent pulmonary edema. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical examination, arterial blood gas determinations or pulse oximetry, and chest roentgenogram. Four adults required reintubation. Six of the seven adults demonstrated very rapid resolution of the pulmonary edema with prompt diagnosis and institution of a therapeutic regimen including oxygen, diuretics, reintubation, and/or positive pressure ventilation. In one patient, the problem was not immediately recognized, and progressed to florid pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation 14 hours later in the emergency room, and 3 days of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of pulmonary edema following upper airway obstruction represents an interplay between several factors: cardiogenic and neurogenic mechanisms, as well as hypoxia contribute. In this group, excessive negative intrathoracic pressure generated by forced inspiration against a closed glottis is the most likely, consistent, and logical explanation. This study suggests that young, healthy, athletic males may be at increased risk for this complication. 
Mammographic densities and risk of breast cancer. To determine the relation of mammographic densities to subsequent breast cancer risk, a case-control study was undertaken using prediagnostic mammograms of screening program participants. Mammograms of cases (n = 266) and controls (n = 301) were blindly assessed for mammographic densities, which were measured by planimetry. The odds of breast cancer increased steadily with increasing breast density (test for trend, P less than 0.0001). Breast cancer odds was 1.7 for densities between 5% and 24.9%, 2.5 for 25% through 44.9%, 3.8 for 45% through 64%, and 4.3 for densities of 65% and greater (referent = less than 5% densities). Odds ratios also increased with increasing densities among women with the P2 and DY mammographic patterns. These findings suggest that the percentage of mammographic densities in the breast can predict breast cancer risk more accurately than a qualitative assessment of mammographic patterns. 
Major vascular complications of orthognathic surgery: false aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas following orthognathic surgery. False aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas are rare complications of orthognathic surgery. The vessel most commonly involved with false aneurysms following mandibular surgery is the internal maxillary artery, and this vessel, especially the sphenopalatine branch, may also be involved following maxillary surgery. An unusual factor in the presentation of false aneurysms following Le Fort I osteotomies is an initial episode of epistaxis occurring greater than 2 weeks postoperatively. Arteriovenous fistulas following orthognathic surgery are more apt to involve large vessels, especially the internal carotid artery. Embolization procedures are the treatment of choice for false aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas in the maxillofacial region following orthognathic surgery. 
Pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin during elective aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Perioperative monitoring has demonstrated that administration of heparin on an empirical basis is associated with a wide variation in patient response and elimination rate. This problem may be overcome by intervention on the basis of perioperative monitoring or by using forms of heparin with different pharmacokinetic properties. When compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin has a higher bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, a linear clearance mechanism with a prolonged half-life, and is at least as effective in preventing postoperative vein thrombosis. Theoretically these characteristics of low-molecular-weight heparin could lead to more predictable levels of heparin activity. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin after an intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortic graft surgery. Heparin activity was measured before heparin administration and at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 minutes after administration. The anti-Xa activity in the low-molecular-weight heparin group showed less variation and was more sustained when compared to the unfractionated heparin group. Fibrin degradation products were moderately correlated with the anti-factor Xa levels of the low-molecular-weight heparin group, but no correlation was found in the unfractionated heparin group. The anti-factor Xa activity of low-molecular-weight heparin was, in contrast to that of unfractionated heparin, not completely reversible by protamine administration. The blood loss was comparable in both groups. In contrast to what was expected, the pharmacokinetic profiles of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin showed a similarity after intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Factors that could have influenced the pharmacokinetic behavior of heparin are discussed. 
Physiologic and anatomic assessment of patients with rectocele. Clinical, physiologic, and anatomic assessments were carried out in 22 female patients with symptomatic rectocele (Group A), 15 patients with asymptomatic rectocele (Group B), and 14 subjects having no rectocele (Group C). Resting and pressure, rectal pressure, rectal compliance, anorectal inhibitory reflex, and rectal sensation did not differ among the groups. Proctography revealed that the lengths of the rectocele during attempted defecation in groups A (1.6 [1.0-3.5] cm) (median and range) and B (1.6 [1.0-3.0] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (0.4 [0.1-0.9] cm) (P less than 0.001 in both groups). Median pelvic floor descent at rest in Groups A (4.3 [1.6-7.5] cm) (median and range) and B (4.3 [1.3-6.9] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (2.5 [1.2-5.0] cm) (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.02, respectively). These results indicate that rectocele is not associated with any physiologic change apart from a significant increase of pelvic floor descent. 
Final report on the second British Institute of Radiology fractionation study: short versus long overall treatment times for radiotherapy of carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx. The second British Institute of Radiology trial of dose fractionation in radiotherapy compared two groups of prospectively randomized patients with squamous carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx; one group was treated in a short (less than or equal to 4 weeks) and the other in a long (greater than 4 weeks) overall time. Treatment in any one centre could be given, with no planned gap in the course of treatment, either as a conventional, daily (5 fractions per week regime) or as 3 fractions per week. A total of 611 patients were allocated to treatment, of whom nine have had to be excluded from the analysis for a lack of information. Patients were admitted to the trial from January 1976 to December 1985 and were followed up for a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 3 years. A reduction in total dose was made for use in the short compared with the long treatment regime. This reduction in total dose varied between 18% and 22% depending on whether 5 fractions or 3 fractions per week regimes were used. Overall, no statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms of the trial. The patients treated with 5 fractions per week in a short overall treatment time showed fewer late normal tissue effects. An analysis based on stratification by age, stage and anatomical site gave a relative risk (short/long overall treatment time) for deaths of 1.23 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.96 to 1.59. Analyses stratified for stage and site gave relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of 1 x 10 (0.84-1.44) for local recurrences/tumour persistence, and 1.01 (0.70-1.45) for laryngectomies. 
Prevalence and natural history of otitis media with perforation in Maori school children. New Zealand Maoris are one of five ethnic groups in developed countries known to have a high rate of ear disease, including perforation of the eardrum (CSOM). It is a strongly held belief by otolaryngologists whose practice dates back to the 1960's that the prevalence of CSOM in Maori children is gradually falling. Despite the obvious practical implications this change has not yet been documented. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of CSOM in two surveys conducted in 1978 and 1987 of children living in a North Island Maori community. A second aim was to examine the natural history of CSOM in these children. The raw data from the 1978 study were reviewed. Of 134 children aged 4-13, 12 had CSOM. In 1987 the same age group yielded 12 children out of 250 with CSOM. The prevalence of CSOM fell from 9 per cent to 4 per cent. The incidence of new perforations in 1987 was 1.3 per cent per child per year. It is concluded there has been a fall in the rate of CSOM, although otitis media remains a significant problem for these children. The probability of a perforation healing was influenced by whether or not the perforation had been observed before: at least 35 per cent of perforations seen for the first time healed, but none of the perforations seen on two occasions healed spontaneously. It was concluded that perforation of the eardrum can be managed conservatively at first. 
Persistent bile leak after liver transplantation: biloma drainage and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic sphincterotomy. Persistent bile leaks after liver transplantation were successfully treated in three patients with percutaneous or surgical drainage of bilomas and endoscopic retrograde ampullary sphincterotomy. In all three patients, biliary anastomoses were achieved by means of choledochocholedochostomies, with a T-tube stent in the anastomosis. The bile leaks led to subhepatic bilomas that had persistently high catheter outputs (greater than 200 mL per 24 hours) for longer than 1 month. Biloma drainage decreased shortly after sphincterotomy. 
Combined pterional-anterolateral approaches to cranial base tumors. Advanced tumors of the paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, orbit, parapharynx, and cranial cavity may invade the infratemporal fossa by direct extension or through natural anatomic pathways. The inability to control disease involving this region is reflected by the unacceptably high recurrence rates for both intracranial and extracranial neoplasms. Between 1983 and 1986, a pterional (or subtemporal) approach was combined with such conventional anterolateral procedures as a mandibulopharyngectomy, maxillectomy, orbitectomy, and parotidectomy in 13 patients with advanced skull base lesions. The tumor origin was extracranial in ten cases and intracranial in three patients. Seven of the neoplasms were malignant and six were histologically benign. Complete tumor removal was achieved in all patients. Repair of the ablative defect was achieved with a temporalis myogenous flap in ten patients, and primary closure or distant myocutaneous flaps in the remaining three patients. Postoperative complications included three lateral nasocutaneous fistulae secondary to temporalis myogenous flap necrosis and isolated cases of stroke, cerebral edema, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Twelve patients are alive without evidence of disease at a mean interval of 25 months. The remaining patient died from lung metastases 11 months after surgery. 
Clinical role of respiratory virus infection in acute otitis media. The clinical characteristics of acute otitis media in relation to coexisting respiratory virus infection were studied in a 1-year prospective study of 363 children with acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses were detected using virus isolation and virus antigen detection in nasopharyngeal specimens of 42% of the patients at the time of diagnosis. Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13%) were the two most common viruses detected. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43 were found less frequently. The mean duration of preceding symptoms was 5.9 days before the diagnosis of acute otitis media. Ninety-four percent of the children had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Fever was reported in 55% and earache in 47% of cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection had fever, cough, and vomiting significantly more often than patients with rhinovirus infection or virus-negative patients. No significant differences were found in the appearance of the tympanic membrane and outcome of illness between virus-negative and virus-positive patients with acute otitis. Most patients respond well to antimicrobial therapy despite the coexisting viral infection. If the symptoms of infection persist, they can be due to the underlying viral infection, and viral diagnostics preferably with rapid methods may be clinically useful in these patients. 
Rationale for the use of 5-HT1-like agonists in the treatment of migraine. Migraine headache is thought to be associated with a dilatation of cranial blood vessels, particularly those in the dura mater, and an accompanying localized sterile inflammatory response. Sumatriptan is a highly selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonist which selectively constricts cranial blood vessels (including those in the dura mater). It also inhibits neurogenically-mediated plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater. Haemodynamic studies in anaesthetized animals have shown that sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arterial circulation and this effect appears to be restricted to an effect on carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. Sumatriptan has a much more selective pharmacological profile than ergot preparations which are also used in the acute treatment of migraine. The development of sumatriptan has been based on a vascular theory of migraine and its high degree of efficacy in the treatment of migraine strengthens the argument that dilatation of cranial blood vessels is the cause of vascular headache. 
Abdominal pain in HIV infection. The causes of abdominal pain in patients with AIDS are different from those of the general population, and there are no guidelines as to which investigations are optimal. We reviewed our experience of 63 patients who presented with abdominal pain as the main reason for admission to the AIDS unit at St Stephen's and Westminster Hospital between January 1988 and January 1990. All patients were assessed within the same structured diagnostic programme. Thirty-five had upper abdominal pain, predominantly in the right upper quadrant in 27; seven had lower abdominal pain, which was concentrated in the right iliac fossa in three; 21 had diffuse abdominal pain. The causes of pain were determined satisfactorily in the majority of patients using routine gastroenterological investigations. The predominant site of pain had considerable predictive value in the diagnosis. The commonest cause of right upper quadrant pain was sclerosing cholangitis (17 of 27); endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography was necessary for a confident diagnosis. Diarrhoea was frequently associated (15 of 21) with diffuse abdominal pain; the commonest cause (six of 21) was cytomegalovirus colitis. Neoplasia was the cause of abdominal pain in eight patients. The other causes of abdominal pain and the utility of various investigations are discussed. An investigatory route which may provide maximum information has been suggested. 
Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in subjects with peristalsis: prevalence and clinical outcome. Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation is recognized in achalasia and has been reported in subjects with esophageal spasm. We reviewed 500 consecutive manometric studies from a 3-yr period to determine the prevalence of this manometric finding, its association with other motility abnormalities, and the clinical outcome of subjects without associated aperistalsis (i.e., without achalasia). We identified 60 subjects with incomplete lower sphincter relaxation, 17 of whom had at least some normal peristalsis (3.4% of the total). Mean lower sphincter residual pressure for these 17 subjects (4.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) was intermediate between those with achalasia (11.7 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) and those with normal relaxation (0.1 +/- 0.2 mm Hg). Both peristaltic and contraction abnormalities in the esophageal body were prevalent in the 17 subjects compared with those who had normal relaxation. Outcome with conservative medical therapy after a mean follow-up of 3.3 yr was not significantly related to presence of peristaltic or contraction abnormalities at presentation, and 71% of subjects with or without these concomitant findings had improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. Only one subject worsened and was treated with pneumatic dilation. We conclude that incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter without aperistalsis is uncommon, symptom regression occurs with conservative therapy, and pneumatic dilation appears rarely required over a modest follow-up period. 
Relation of stenosis resolution pressure to long-term clinical outcome after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Variables associated with a poor long-term prognosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) include a short duration of symptoms before PTCA, unstable angina and the presence of thrombus at the PTCA site. These imply a component of transient or dynamic obstruction as opposed to a pure fixed obstruction. It is postulated that resolution pressure (i.e., the pressure at which complete balloon inflation occurs) may also correlate with prognosis after successful PTCA. In 173 consecutive patients undergoing successful, elective, single-lesion PTCA, 48 (28%) were found to have narrowings that resolved at less than or equal to 2 atm (group 1) and 125 (72%) were found to have narrowings resolved at greater than 2 atm (group 2). There were no significant differences in baseline, anatomic or procedural variables between the 2 groups, except that angiographic coronary dissection occurred in 17% of group 1 patients versus 40% of group 2 patients (p less than 0.007). During a mean follow-up of 12.0 +/- 6.1 months, the incidence of cardiac events (repeat PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction) was 29% in group 1 versus 15% in group 2 (p less than 0.05). The overall incidence of angina was similar between the groups (25 vs 28%), but Canadian Cardiovascular Association class 4 angina occurred significantly more frequently in group 1 than group 2 (21 vs 8%) (p less than 0.04). These data suggest that a low resolution pressure is associated with a higher incidence of unstable angina and recurrent cardiac events during follow-up than higher resolution pressures. 
What if Americans ate less fat? A quantitative estimate of the effect on mortality. Americans consume an average of 37% of their energy intake as fat. Many authorities recommend restricting fat intake to 30% of energy intake to reduce the rates of coronary heart disease and perhaps of cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. Based on the assumptions that underlie those recommendations, we estimated the effect of this dietary change on mortality. If all Americans restricted their intake of dietary fat by reducing consumption of saturated fat and accompanying dietary cholesterol, the corresponding reductions in serum cholesterol levels could reduce coronary heart disease mortality rates by 5% to 20%, depending on age. If the relationship between dietary fat and cancer is as strong as has been observed in some studies, the proportional effects on mortality from fat-related cancers could be even greater, although the absolute effects--given the lower mortality rates--would be smaller. Overall, if the assumptions are correct, about 42,000 of the 2.3 million deaths that would have occurred in adults each year in the United States could be deferred. This 2% benefit, equivalent to an increase in average life expectancy of 3 to 4 months, would accrue chiefly to people over the age of 65 years. If recent concerns about the possibly harmful effects of cholesterol lowering on mortality from noncardiovascular causes--which mainly affect younger persons--are valid, these relatively modest benefits would be overestimates of the actual effect. 
Near normalization of adolescent height with growth hormone therapy in very short children without growth hormone deficiency. Ten prepubertal children with stature at or below the 1st percentile for height and without growth hormone deficiency received 0.3 U recombinant growth hormone per kilogram daily for 2 years before puberty. Their growth velocity increased from 4 +/- 0.3 cm/yr before treatment to 10.7 +/- 0.6 and 8.8 +/- 0.6 cm, respectively, during the first and second years of treatment, and then remained at 5.7 +/- 0.7 cm the year after the end of growth hormone administration. This resulted in a near normalization of adolescent height. Bone maturation paralleled chronologic age, and therefore the expected final height of the children increased by approximately 10 cm. Administration of growth hormone induced a reversible hyperinsulinemia, with moderate and transient changes in glucose metabolism. A prospective, randomized study, including an untreated cohort, will be needed to confirm the effects on final height and to determine the magnitude of the response in familial short stature. 
Gastric duplication cyst. Endoscopic presentation as an ulcerated antral mass. A case of a 53-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss is described. Endoscopy showed a smooth antral mass with what appeared to be a central overlying ulcer. Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass. Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen. Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult. Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation. 
Distinction between metabolic and myogenic mechanisms of coronary hyperemic response to brief diastolic occlusion. We monitored an index of coronary vascular resistance (mean aortic pressure/mean coronary flow) in 19 heart-blocked conscious dogs paced at 60 beats/min and instrumented with an aortic pressure catheter, left circumflex artery electromagnetic flow probe, and a coronary occluder. Cessation of pacing for a single beat resulted in a long diastole control (LDC) intervention beat of 2-second duration characterized by a progressive rise in diastolic coronary vascular resistance index. A 400-msec coronary artery occlusion early in a long diastole (LD4) dramatically inhibited the rate of rise in resistance index during the first 600 msec (phase 1) after occlusion. Partial recovery of the resistance index rise rate was evident during the remaining 400 msec (phase 2) of the long diastole. In nine dogs, LDC and LD4 intervention beats were instituted during two conditions of myocardial metabolic activity in which the myogenic stimuli associated with coronary occlusion would be similar: 1) paired pacing and 2) normal pacing plus intravenous adenosine and phenylephrine infusions (AP) to maintain mean aortic pressure and coronary flow at paired pacing levels. During paired pacing, the LD4-LDC differences in phase 1 and 2 resistance index rise rates (-69 +/- 18 and -48 +/- 31 mmHg/ml/sec2, respectively) were greater than during normal pacing plus AP (-32 +/- 14 and -1 +/- 32 mm Hg/ml/sec2, phase 1 and 2, respectively) (p less than 0.05). These differences are consistent with operation of a metabolic mechanism in response to occlusion. 
Sympathetic secretory response to hypercapnic acidosis in swine. We studied the effect of graded acute hypercapnic acidosis (HA) on sympathetic neural activation in 15 juvenile farm swine in vivo. In seven animals with acute HA, plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration increased progressively from 189 +/- 34 to 483 +/- 80 pg/ml (P less than 0.04) as arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) increased in steps from 40 to 80 Torr (pH 7.17 +/- 0.01). Plasma epinephrine (EPI) concentration increased from 30 +/- 15 to 125 +/- 66 pg/ml (P = NS) over the same change in PaCO2. At PaCO2 of 110 Torr, plasma NE increased 3.4-fold above maximal basal concentrations; plasma EPI was 1.8-fold greater than basal under the same conditions. With HA, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased from 1,748 +/- 110 to 1,392 +/- 145 dyn.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.0002), cardiac output (CO) increased from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 l/min (P less than 0.01), and heart rate (HR) increased from 117 +/- 11 to 154 +/- 17 beats/min (P less than 0.03). To demonstrate that catecholamine secretion was related directly to acidosis caused by an increase in PaCO2, HCO3- was infused in eight other swine to buffer extracellular acute HA (pH 7.37 +/- 0.01 at PaCO2 of 80 Torr). Buffering attenuated the increase in plasma NE, which remained within the normal range at PaCO2 of 80 Torr. The decrease in SVR and increases in CO and HR also were also attenuated by HCO3- buffering of HA. We demonstrate the effects of graded acute HA on endogenous secretion of catecholamine and on the associated hemodynamic responses in swine. 
Metabolism of 25-OH-vitamin D3 by peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3), is produced mainly by the kidney, but there is evidence for extrarenal production in certain circumstances. We studied whether peritoneal macrophages (PM) from CAPD patients were capable of metabolizing 25-OH-D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3. We found that PM were able to metabolize 25-OH-D3 in vitro; the main product following 16 hours of incubation was 19-nor, 10-oxo, 25-OH-D3 with smaller amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3. However, after shorter incubations of three and five hours a larger portion of 1,25(OH)2D3 was produced. The metabolism of 25-OH-D3 was greatly enhanced in PM harvested during episodes of peritonitis. This property was specific for PM of CAPD patients, and was not found in PM from normal subjects. However, incubation of control PM with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients resulted in induction of the ability of these cells to metabolize 25-OH-D3. This induction was enhanced by preincubation with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients suffering from peritonitis. Prostaglandin E2 was found to be involved in this synthesis: addition of PGE2 to normal PM induced metabolism of 25-OH-D3, and incubation of PM from CAPD patients with indomethacin decreased the metabolism of 25-OH-D3. The vitamin D metabolites produced by PM from CAPD patients could have a role in immunological resistance to peritoneal infections. 
Recombinant alpha interferon in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A cooperative phase II study. A total of 61 evaluable patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma have been treated with 3 x 10(6) IU per square meter of body surface with recombinant alpha 2b interferon three times a week within a Cooperative Phase II Study. Toxic death for terminal renal failure occurred in 1 patient (1.63%), and toxicities greater than WHO grade 2 were present in 10 cases (16%). The overall response rate after six months of treatment was 13.1% (partial response 4, minor response 4). Two complete responses were obtained at nine and fifteen months (3.3%). Long-lasting stabilization of disease was 13.1 percent. 
Screening mammography. Screening mammography can reduce mortality from breast cancer and is the only means of detecting nonpalpable cancers that are often more curable. Based on this, guidelines have evolved but compliance with them has been slow. Reservations are based on yield-cost-benefit-harm considerations, but uniformed and/or disadvantaged women and reluctance if not resistance to screening mammography by primary care physicians are major problems. The challenges are to overcome these obstacles and to obtain sufficient competent personnel and facilities to make reproducibly optimum screening mammography, which is accurately interpreted, widely available to all eligible women at the lowest possible cost. 
Colposcopic evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive women. To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cervical histology, 32 known HIV-seropositive women underwent cervical colposcopic evaluation. All had cervical cytology, colposcopically directed biopsy, and T-cell studies performed. Thirteen of 32 patients (41%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Another 14 of 32 patients (44%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis. Abnormal cytology, noted in only three women, suggested CIN in one and inflammatory atypia in two. All (five of five) patients with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS had CIN, compared with 30% (eight of 27) of non-AIDS HIV-positive patients (P less than .05). Patients diagnosed with CIN had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (221/mm3 versus 408/mm3; P less than .06) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.33 versus 0.62; P less than .02) than those without CIN. Patients with cervicitis had greater T-cell immunosuppression than did those with normal histology. In addition, patients with AIDS were more likely to have higher-grade lesions than were non-AIDS HIV-seropositive patients. Seven of 12 CIN specimens available for analysis by polymerase chain reaction using consensus sequence primers detected human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, including three patients with three or more HPV types. Our data suggest that abnormal cervical pathology is common among HIV-positive women and that cytologic screening is not predictive of CIN in this population. In addition, the presence and severity of cervical dysplasia correlates with quantitative T-cell function. We strongly recommend that cervical colposcopy be part of the routine management of HIV-seropositive women. 
Abrupt outpatient withdrawal of medication in analgesic-abusing migraineurs. 46 migraineurs with secondary chronic daily headache were treated for medication abuse as outpatients by abrupt withdrawal of the offending drugs. The patients were supported with adequate explanation of the disorder, regular follow-up, amitriptyline (10 mg at night), and naproxen (500 mg) for relief of headache symptoms. By 6 months of follow-up 37 patients had relief from chronic headaches, and analgesic intake had become intermittent and appropriate to the original occasional migraine episodes. 6 had substantially reduced analgesic intake, but headache severity was unchanged; 2 had not managed to reduce intake and headache was unchanged; and 1 patient withdrew after the first visit. 
Factors affecting compliance with screening sigmoidoscopy BACKGROUND. A retrospective, qualitative study in a university setting was undertaken to better understand factors influencing patient compliance with screening sigmoidoscopy. METHODS. Individuals who completed screening sigmoidoscopy were interviewed to learn about the physician-patient relationship, general knowledge of cancer, family experience with cancer, exposure to the media, and specific reasons why sigmoidoscopy was completed. RESULTS. Respondents reported that their physician's recommendation had a strong positive influence on their decision to have sigmoidoscopic screening, as did their family and personal experiences with cancer. In all cases, the patients stated that they would not have had a sigmoidoscopy without the recommendation of their physician. Respondents were little influenced by exposure to the media or by famous personalities. CONCLUSIONS. The importance of the physician's recommendation for the patient to have sigmoidoscopy and demonstration of concern with early cancer detection may represent the primary motivating factors in completion of screening sigmoidoscopy. 
An improved method for the quantification of left-to-right cardiac shunts. We have investigated a technique for quantifying QP/QS in left-to-right cardiac shunts. In this method, the gamma variate, which is fitted to the first-pass portion of the lung curve, is used to generate a curve, which simulates the response of a normal lung curve with systemic recirculation. The difference between this curve and the observed lung curve is then used to calculate QP/QS. This method was evaluated on a set of simulated lung time-activity curves with precisely known QP/QS values on a group of 11 patients with no clinical suspicion of cardiac shunt and on a group of 30 patients referred for cardiac shunt studies. The QP/QS in each of these studies was determined by three individuals using both the Maltz-Treves method and the new method. This method yielded QP/QS values that were more accurate on the simulated lung data and had less interobserver variation on all the studies than those obtained from the Maltz-Treves method. 
Diffuse Lewy body disease presenting with a supranuclear gaze palsy. A patient with diffuse Lewy body disease presented with supranuclear vertical and horizontal ophthalmoplegia, dementia, axial rigidity and falls, bradykinesia and pyramidal signs. This broadens the clinical presentation of this pathological diagnosis and re-emphasises the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed clinically as progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome). 
Computed tomography for patient management in coronary artery disease. Computed tomography (CT) represents the optimum theoretical approach to x-ray imaging. This conclusion results from an awareness of CT's capacity to solve the fundamental limitation of all forms of x-ray imaging--the superimposition of anatomic structures. Because CT is potentially a fully three-dimensional method, this problem is addressed in a manner not subject to the risks, complications, and technical limitations of selective angiography, subtraction angiography, tomography, and other techniques. Ultrafast CT provides a broad spectrum of useful quantitative cardiac data during one minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, the optimism for cine CT imaging of the heart is well founded. Apart from the demonstration of anatomic structures in any reconstructed plane and in movie format, without the need for any form of electrocardiographic gating, this new generation of millisecond CT scanners offers a unique potential for measuring myocardial mechanics and perfusion. Myocardial integrity can be evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening, which is a sensitive indicator of blood flow. It can also be assessed by time-density changes derived from analyzing the passage of contrast medium through thin slices of myocardium. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that this should be possible in the clinical setting by use of fast CT scanning. The radiation exposure to the patient with cine CT is low and comparable to, or less than, that of conventional CT and 10-15% of that received during angiocardiography; therefore, it is not a practical limitation. Further clinical and research studies are needed to determine the future role of this exciting new modality in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart disease. 
Arboviral infections in the United States. Arboviruses are important considerations in the differential diagnosis of encephalitis and other acute infections. Alterations in the environment and in human behaviors contribute to changing patterns of arboviral transmission. These trends, the periodic epidemic resurgence of arboviral diseases such as St. Louis encephalitis, and the discovery of new arboviruses present a continued challenge to infectious disease clinicians. 
Changes in protein, RNA and DNA and rates of protein synthesis in muscle-containing tissues of the mature rat in response to ethanol feeding: a comparative study of heart, small intestine and gastrocnemius muscle. 1. The relative sensitivity of heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle to chronic ethanol feeding was investigated in mature Wistar rats fed ethanol as 36% of total energy intake; controls were fed the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isoenergetic glucose. 2. Chronic ethanol feeding had no apparent effect on the protein, RNA and DNA contents of heart homogenates (atria and ventricles). The ratios of RNA/protein (synthetic capacity), RNA/DNA (synthetic material per nucleus) and protein/DNA (DNA-unit or apparent cell size) were also unaltered in the hearts of alcohol-fed rats. Fractional rates of cardiac protein synthesis (ks), and synthesis relative to RNA (kRNA) and DNA (kDNA) and absolute rates of protein synthesis (Vs) were unaffected by ethanol feeding. The total content of cardiac soluble proteins was unaltered by chronic ethanol feeding, but there were small and statistically significant decreases in the contents of the myofibrillar and stromal protein fractions. There were no differences in ks in any of the cardiac subcellular protein fractions. 3. In the small intestine, ethanol feeding had no statistically significant effect on either protein or RNA contents, but there was an apparent increase in RNA when expressed relative to either protein or DNA, though the DNA-unit was unaltered. There were also substantial decreases in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs of approximately 15-35%. 4. In the gastrocnemius, RNA contents were significantly reduced by ethanol feeding but protein and DNA contents were unaffected. Indices of the synthetic capacity and synthetic material per nucleus were also reduced, but the DNA-unit was unaltered. These observations were accompanied by approx. 15-30% reductions in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs in response to ethanol feeding. 5. It is concluded that various aspects of protein metabolism in the heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle are adversely affected by chronic ethanol toxicity. The characteristics and magnitude of the responses in each tissue differ. Effects in the heart may be subtle, though haemodynamic indices may ensue. The ethanol-induced alterations in the small intestine and skeletal muscle may be responsible for gastrointestinal disturbances in motility and skeletal muscle weakness, respectively. 
Collagenous colitis: pathophysiologic considerations. Collagenous colitis, a cause of watery diarrhea characterized by a distinctive band of collagen under the surface epithelium of the colon, has been recognized with increasing frequency in recent years. The pathophysiology of collagenous colitis remains obscure. The thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer may be a response to chronic inflammation or a local abnormality of collagen synthesis. The precise mechanism of the diarrhea in collagenous colitis is also unclear, and it has not been possible to link the diarrhea directly to the excess collagen deposition. The relationship between collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, another type of microscopic colitis, remains to be defined; elucidating the relationship between the two disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both. 
Possible linkage of the estrogen receptor gene to breast cancer in a family with late-onset disease. The estrogen-receptor locus is a candidate gene for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer, particularly among families with later onset, primarily estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. For one extended family with eight patients with late-onset disease, one estrogen-receptor haplotype was consistently coinherited with breast cancer, yielding a +1.85 lod score for linkage at zero recombination. Simulation of this pedigree assuming independent inheritance of breast cancer and estrogen-receptor genotypes led to a lod score greater than or equal to 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates. We suggest testing linkage of this gene to breast cancer in other families with late-onset disease. 
Clinical pharmacology of intravenous enoximone: pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in patients with heart failure. Twenty-one patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to IV) received a 24-hour infusion of enoximone followed by a 12-hour washout period. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Groups I to III received an 0.5 mg/kg bolus, followed by a maintenance infusion of 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 micrograms/kg/min. Group IV patients received a maintenance infusion of 5.0 micrograms/kg/min without a loading dose. Serial assessment of hemodynamics, plasma levels of enoximone and enoximone sulfoxide, and ventricular ectopy were performed. Enoximone produced a clinically significant increase in cardiac index, and a decrease in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance in all groups. Enoximone mildly increased heart rate, and had a minimal effect on mean arterial pressure. There was no statistically significant change in ventricular ectopy during the infusion. Significant hemodynamic improvement was noted at even the lowest infusion rate, and did not increase in linear fashion at higher infusion rates. In patients who did not receive an initial loading bolus of 0.5 mg/kg, the increase in cardiac index was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Plasma concentrations of both enoximone and its major metabolite continued to rise throughout the 24-hour infusion in group III (10.0 micrograms/kg/min), rather than reaching steady state as predicted by the terminal exponential half-lives of these compounds. This is suggestive of nonlinear pharmacokinetics and indicates a potential for excessive accumulation of enoximone and its metabolite during prolonged infusion. These findings may have important implications in guiding the intravenous administration of enoximone. 
Very severe self-poisoning lithium carbonate intoxication causing a myocardial infarction. A case of severe lithium carbonate self-poisoning is described, presenting with a very high serum lithium level (14.6 mmol/L) on admission. Lengthy and repeated hemodialyses were required to lower lithemia to nontoxic ranges. As is usually reported, our patient had prolonged neurologic manifestations (coma, hyperreflexia, fluctuating focal signs) and developed hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and diarrhea. Other less common features were the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction without coronary artery lesions and thrombocytopenia. The possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed. Hemodialysis and supportive intensive care treatment are commented upon. The final outcome was favorable, and the patient recovered completely. 
Quantification of ST-segment changes during coronary angioplasty in patients with left bundle branch block. Electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia are difficult to interpret in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction. With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction. ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm). ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003). It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia. 
Effects of early captopril administration on infarct expansion, left ventricular remodeling and exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction. In a double-blind study, 99 patients (82 men, age range 40 to 75 years) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo. Treatment began within 24 hours of admission. Serial echocardiographic measurements of endocardial segment lengths and left ventricular (LV) volumes, and ejection fractions were obtained. The 2 groups were matched at baseline except for an excess of previous AMI in the placebo group (13 of 50 vs 2 of 49 patients, p = 0.002). The increase in anterior segment length, from baseline to 2 months, was significantly less in the captopril than in the placebo group (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.4mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.5 to -1.7, p = 0.01). The increase in posterior segment length was also less in the captopril group, but the difference was not significant (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.8mm, 95% CI -8.0 to 0.5, p = 0.08). Fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated increases in segment length greater than 2 standard deviations of the measurement error (14 of 70 [20%] vs 29 of 72 [40%] patients, p = 0.009). In patients with anterior AMI, the infarct-containing anterior segment length increased by 4.5 +/- 2.3 mm in the captopril versus 12.4 +/- 3.1 mm in the placebo group (95% CI -15.7 to -0.2, p = 0.046), and fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated infarct expansion (6 of 20 [30%] vs 13 of 21 [62%] patients, p = 0.04). 
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase is a peroxisomal enzyme in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. The intracellular localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) has been examined by immunofluorescence using four monoclonal anti-Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase antibodies raised against a recombinant human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase derivative produced and purified from Escherichia coli. Colocalization with catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was used to demonstrate the peroxisomal localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. In the fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome patients, the enzyme is not transported to the peroxisomal ghosts but, like catalase, remains in the cytoplasm. In addition, immunocryoelectron microscopy of yeast cells expressing human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase showed that the enzyme is translocated to the peroxisomes. 
Adrenaline injection for endoscopic haemostasis in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Over a 30-month period, 53 patients with actively bleeding non-variceal lesions of the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum were treated by endoscopic injection of 1/10,000 adrenaline. Initial haemostasis was obtained in 50 cases, and permanent haemostasis in 44. Emergency surgery for bleeding was required in nine patients overall, and there were four deaths. All lesions requiring surgery were located on the posterior wall of the duodenum or the lesser curve of the stomach, and all but one had evidence of an exposed arterial vessel. Adrenaline injection is an effective, safe and simple method of endoscopic haemostasis. 
Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and heat-shock 27-kD protein in liver biopsy specimens from patients with hepatitis B virus infection. It has been proposed that in the human liver, the estrogen receptor gene may become inappropriately expressed as a consequence of HBV integration, contributing to cell transformation. This study was undertaken to examine estrogen receptor status in patients with hepatitis B virus infection and to analyze the expression of progesterone receptor and of a heat-shock 27,000-D protein (hsp27), both of which are estrogen regulated in estrogen target tissues. Receptor proteins were detected in liver biopsy specimens by immunocytochemistry using antireceptor monoclonal antibodies; a monoclonal antibody was also used to detect hsp27. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were mainly seen in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The presence of hepatitis B virus infection did not always result in elevated estrogen receptor expression, but in general the expression of this receptor protein was higher in hepatitis B virus-positive patients than in patients with the same pathological findings (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma) but without hepatitis B virus. This was more clearly seen in the patients with hepatitis. Although estrogen receptor expression was moderate to high in many samples, the expression of the two biochemical markers of estrogen action at postreceptor levels (progesterone receptor and hsp27) was low or absent in most of the liver tissues examined, suggesting that in the liver the interaction of estrogen-estrogen receptor-DNA has characteristics inherent to this tissue. 
Fasting plasma glucose levels and endogenous androgens in non-diabetic postmenopausal women. 1. The clinical association between glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism is well recognized in premenopausal women with polycystic ovarian disease. We examined the hypothesis that fasting plasma glucose levels might be related to endogenous androgen levels in postmenopausal women in the absence of overt clinical disease. 2. In a Southern Californian cohort of 848 nondiabetic postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, fasting plasma glucose levels positively correlated with levels of the endogenous androgens dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone and negatively with sex-hormone-binding globulin across the whole range of glucose and hormone levels. Mean dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone levels were 16% and 46% higher, respectively, and mean sex-hormone-binding globulin levels 27% lower in the top compared with the bottom quartile of fasting plasma glucose levels. This relationship was independent of age, body mass index, cigarette smoking habit and exogenous oestrogen use. 3. These findings raise questions about the possible physiological role of androgens in the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and, possibly, in the mediation of the some of the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes in women. 
Pharyngeal function and snoring characteristics in apneic and nonapneic snorers. Abnormalities in pharyngeal function, manifested even when the patients are awake, are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Tests of awake pharyngeal function continue to stimulate interest because it is hoped that they may allow physicians to distinguish patients with sleep apnea from those without it, and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary sleep studies. We elected to study two measures of pharyngeal function: changes in pharyngeal area with lung volume (PLVD) and changes in pharyngeal area in response to externally applied positive pressure, i.e., pharyngeal distensibility (Cph). Both measurements have been employed for assessment of pharyngeal function, and both are thought to reflect pharyngeal "floppiness." Measurement of PLVD is technically very simple, whereas the measurement of Cph is technically more complex. If the two measurements are highly correlated, it might be possible to replace the technically more difficult one by the simpler one. Consequently, the purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to examine the relationship between pharyngeal distensibility and lung volume dependence of pharyngeal area, and second, to compare these parameters in a large group of confirmed snorers with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We studied 75 unselected patients referred for the investigation of snoring and suspected sleep apnea. All patients had nocturnal polysomnography, pulmonary function tests, and measurement of pharyngeal areas at TLC, FRC, and residual volume (RV) employing the acoustic reflection technique. The area measurement at FRC was performed at zero and at 4.1 cm H2O positive airway pressure to calculate pharyngeal distensibility. 
Ligamentous compression of the celiac axis: CT findings in five patients. Compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm is an uncommon angiographic and surgical finding that rarely may be symptomatic. We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans in five patients with severe ligamentous compression of the celiac axis, confirmed by surgery and/or angiography, and compared the findings with those of enhanced scans of 100 consecutive patients without known ligamentous compression. In all five patients with ligamentous celiac artery compression, CT showed effacement or narrowing of the celiac trunk by an anterior soft-tissue band. Dilated peripancreatic collateral vessels were seen in four cases, and poststenotic dilatation of the distal celiac trunk was seen in two cases. The normal appearance of the vasculature was seen in the majority (76%) of the 100 control subjects, but in eight patients the celiac origin was obscured on CT scans, and in 16 patients the celiac trunk appeared narrow or effaced. Our experience suggests that severe ligamentous celiac artery compression can be identified on CT. However, the isolated CT finding of effacement or obscuration of the celiac axis occurs sufficiently often in normal patients that it is not adequate evidence to establish the diagnosis of celiac artery compression. 
Tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells: endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 as an inducible adhesive receptor specific for colon carcinoma cells. Activation of endothelial cells by the two inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor strongly increases tumor cell adhesion. We describe antibody inhibition studies showing that the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell-surface glycoprotein selectively expressed by cytokine-activated endothelial cells and responsible for neutrophil adhesion, is the major, if not the only, mediator of colon carcinoma cell adhesion to activated endothelial cells. Among the different tumor cell lines tested, seven colon carcinoma cell lines were sensitive to ELAM-1 antibodies. Adhesion of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and lung, cervix, or kidney carcinoma cell lines to IL-1-treated endothelial cells was not affected by the ELAM-1 antibody. This result suggests that ELAM-1 is selectively recognized by colon carcinoma cells and that adhesion of tumor cells to activated endothelial cells could be mediated by different and specific mechanisms. 
Effect of long-term enalapril therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in men with mild heart failure and previous myocardial infarction. Forty-one men with documented myocardial infarction greater than 6 months previously were randomized to long-term (48 weeks) therapy with placebo or enalapril on a double-blind basis. All patients were receiving concurrent therapy with digitalis and a diuretic drug for symptomatic heart failure (functional class II or III). The mean age was 64 +/- 7.3 years and no patient suffered from exertional chest pain. Patients underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exertional chest pain. Patients underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing to exhaustion on an ergometer cycle nine times over the course of 48 weeks. Gas exchange data were collected on a breath by breath basis with use of a continuous ramp protocol. In the placebo group (n = 21), the mean (+/- SD) peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at baseline was 18.8 +/- 5.2 versus 18.5 +/- 5.5 ml/kg per min at 48 weeks (-1.4%, p = NS). In the enalapril group (n = 20), the corresponding values were 18.1 +/- 3.1 versus 18.3 +/- 2.6 ml/kg per min (+2.8%, p = NS). The mean VO2 at the anaerobic threshold for the placebo group at baseline study was 13.1 +/- 3.5 versus 12.8 +/- 2.1 ml/kg per min at 48 weeks (-2.2%, p = NS). The corresponding values for the enalapril group were 11.8 +/- 2.3 versus 11.8 +/- 2.4 ml/kg per min (+1.4%, p = NS). The mean total exercise duration in the placebo group at baseline study was 589 +/- 153 versus 620 +/- 181 s at 48 weeks (+5.4%, p = NS). 
Dysfibrinogenemia associated with thrombosis and third-trimester fetal loss. A case report. Dysfibrinogenemias are rare genetic disorders that are clinically silent, cause a mild bleeding tendency or have thromboembolic manifestations. During pregnancy they often cause hemorrhage and first-trimester abortions. A patient with a severe thrombotic tendency during pregnancy had a third-trimester fetal loss. 
Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase expression in foetal skin, inflammatory dermatoses and cutaneous neoplasia. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme expressed by some epithelial neoplasms but not normal interfollicular epidermis. In order to examine the relationship between malignant change and de-differentiation we studied histochemically the expression of GGT in human foetal skin, various inflammatory dermatoses and epidermal neoplasms. In foetal skin GGT was detectable after 7 weeks' gestation, reached a maximum at 11 weeks and was undetectable by 24 weeks. It was expressed strongly by squamous cell carcinoma and focally in Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses. There was no GGT expression in basal cell carcinoma or most benign skin tumours, but keratoacanthomas were weakly positive. Keratinocytes in the vicinity of malignant melanocytes also expressed GGT. This study suggests that GGT expression, while not a simple marker of malignancy, may represent reversion to a less differentiated or 'foetal' phenotype. 
Primary orbital intraosseous hemangioma. Primary orbital intraosseous hemangiomas are rare--only 16 cases have been reported previously. The authors describe five patients with this benign tumor. Patients ranged in age from 49 to 77 years, and each had a painless or mildly tender nodular lesion. Ophthalmic symptoms were minimal, although nasolacrimal obstruction was the original sign in one patient. Four of five patients responded well to complete tumor excision (two patients) or partial resection of the lesion (two patients). The fifth patient required a second operation for tumor progression after partial excision of the hemangioma. The 16 previously reported cases of orbital intraosseous hemangioma are reviewed, and the natural history and pathology of this rare vascular lesion are discussed. 
Risks of untreated hypertension. A discussion [comment] There is a strong and graded association between blood pressure and the incidence of major coronary heart disease manifestations, congestive heart failure, stroke, and total mortality. The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
High-dose epinephrine improves the return of spontaneous circulation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the return of spontaneous circulation (RSC) rates in human victims of cardiac arrest treated with standard doses of epinephrine (SDE) or high-dose epinephrine (HDE). DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: A university hospital emergency department during 1987 through 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: At the discretion of the treating physician, patients received epinephrine in bolus doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg. HDE was defined as a dose of at least 0.2 mg/kg; smaller doses were defined as SDE. Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. Patients were also grouped by their presenting rhythm. Potentially perfusing rhythm was electromechanical dissociation or ventricular tachycardia. Nonperfusing rhythm was asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Rates were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and the two-tailed unpaired t test. HDE improved the rate of initial resuscitation (P = .008). The effect was greatest in patients with nonperfusing rhythms (P = .014) and disappeared when evaluating patients with potentially perfusing rhythms. No patient survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: High-dose epinephrine improves initial resuscitation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. Its greatest effect is in patients with a nonperfusing rhythm. 
Intratemporal facial nerve hemangiomas. Facial nerve hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that arise within the temporal bone and have a histologic appearance similar to both cavernous hemangiomas and vascular malformations. In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size. We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors. Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection. Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients. 
Prevention of arrhythmias after noncardiac thoracic operations: flecainide versus digoxin. Cardiac arrhythmias are known complications of thoracic operations. The prophylactic value of flecainide administered as a constant-rate, intravenous infusion (0.15 mg.kg-1.h-1) after a loading dose (2 mg.kg-1) was compared with digoxin (10 micrograms.kg-1 for 12 hours, then 0.25 mg.24 h-1) in a randomized study in 30 patients using Holter monitoring during the first 72 hours after operation. Drug monitoring was performed every day to keep a serum level of flecainide of 200 to 600 ng.mL-1 and a digoxin level of 0.8 to 2 ng.mL-1. Failure, defined as the appearance of atrial fibrillation or flutter or the development of complex ventricular arrhythmias (Lown IVb and V), was observed in one patient in the flecainide group (7%) and in 7 patients in the digoxin group (47%) (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that flecainide is more efficient than digoxin in preventing and treating cardiac arrhythmias after thoracic operations. At the dosage used side effects related to flecainide or digoxin were not observed. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: results of an early experience. Ninety consecutive patients over a 6-month period with acute (31 patients) or chronic (59 patients) cholecystitis underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an ambulatory (49 patients), one-night (33 patients), or two-night (5 patients) basis. Three patients required open procedures for 1) perforated duodenal ulcer at 48 h, postoperatively, 2) a cholecystoduodenal fistula, and 3) Mirizzis syndrome with erosion of the common duct. The procedure is safe, efficacious, and should be offered to patients with acute and chronic biliary disease. 
Dysmegakaryopoiesis resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in treated acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by trilineage dysplasia, including atypical megakaryocytes. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB M7) is particularly associated with atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia (AMH). Fifteen patients with nonmegakaryoblastic AML developed AMH after therapy, comprising 12.6% of cases of AML diagnosed from 1986 to 1989. Platelet counts were normal in nine patients and decreased in six. Blasts comprised less than 5% of cells in 40% of the biopsies, ranged from 5-15% in 53%, and comprised more than 30% of cells in 7%. Numerous small hypo- and hyperlobated megakaryocytes were seen in all specimens, often occurring in clusters, and were more easily seen in sections than in smears. Subsequent biopsies in 13 patients showed a remission marrow in seven, increased blasts in three, and AML in three; none showed AMH. AMH resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia may be seen transiently after treatment of AML. 
Etiology of autism: genetic influences. In summary, there are a few specific genetic conditions that can be associated with autism. Among cases of unknown etiology, there is ample evidence for a higher genetic liability to autism in siblings of autistic probands than expected from the population prevalence. It appears likely that both parents and siblings have a higher liability for social and cognitive deficits that are milder but conceptually similar to those found in autism. Others factors may alter this underlying genetic liability such as sex, IQ, and prenatal and perinatal injury. In the future, genetic analyses and genetic linkage studies will need to consider using a broader definition of the autism phenotype to include not only autism but severe cognitive and social deficits. The exact genetic mechanisms and genes involved are the subject of current investigations by several research groups. Investigations in this area are likely to continue to provide important information about the causes of autism. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. II. Clinical manifestations and syndromes. During a 4-year period 1984 to 1988, 20 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were found to have a mitochondrial disease. Each diagnosis was based on the results of thorough biochemical and morphologic investigations. The patients were separated into one series with mainly encephalopathy (n = 14) and another with mainly myopathy (n = 6). The patients with encephalopathy had the following syndromes: Kearns-Sayre (n = 2), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; n = 2), MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; n = 3), Alpers (n = 3), Leigh (n = 1), and other variants (n = 3). In patients with myopathy, three had hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria were the most common morphologic changes in the muscle biopsies. Complex I deficiency was most common in the patients with encephalopathy. All of the patients with myopathy had complex IV deficiency. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA were found in six patients with encephalopathy. We conclude that identification of defects at the DNA level and determination of the phenotypic expression with clinical, morphologic, and biochemical methods are fundamental for future rational classification of mitochondrial disorders. 
Juvenile fibromatosis of the orbit: a case report with review of the literature. Proliferation of fibrous tissues to form a localised mass with infiltrating margins may occur anywhere in the body; involvement of the orbit is rare. Children and young adults are most commonly affected. The term 'juvenile fibromatosis' is one of several synonyms. Of the two main forms of this entity, the solitary form is the more common and the prognosis is good. The multicentric form has a poor prognosis. The patients described, a 2 1/2-year-old boy, had a solitary nodule of juvenile fibromatosis removed from the right orbit and was asymptomatic 2 3/4 years postoperatively. 
Ultrasonic detection of parathyroid adenomas. High-resolution real time sonography was used to evaluate patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism. A total of 12 consecutive patients was scanned pre-operatively. The sensitivity of the procedure was 92% and the specificity 97%. In our hospital sonography is the procedure of choice for localizing enlarged parathyroid glands prior to surgical exploration. 
A comparison between heparin and low-dose aspirin as adjunctive therapy with tissue plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial (HART) Investigators BACKGROUND. We report the results of the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial, a collaborative study comparing early intravenous heparin with oral aspirin as adjunctive treatment when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used for coronary thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned to receive either immediate and then continuous intravenous heparin (starting with a 5000-unit bolus; n = 106) or immediate and then daily oral aspirin (80 mg; n = 99) together with rt-PA (100 mg intravenously over a six-hour period) initiated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. We evaluated the patency of the infarct-related artery by angiography 7 to 24 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, the frequency of reocclusion of the artery by repeat angiography on day 7, and ischemic or hemorrhagic complications during the hospital stay. RESULTS. At the time of the first angiogram, 82 percent of the infarct-related arteries in the patients assigned to heparin were patent, as compared with only 52 percent in the aspirin group (P less than 0.0001). Of the initially patent vessels, 88 percent remained patent after seven days in the heparin group, as compared with 95 percent in the aspirin group (P not significant). The numbers of hemorrhagic events (18 in the heparin and 15 in the aspirin group) and recurrent ischemic events (8 in the heparin and 2 in the aspirin group) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Coronary patency rates associated with rt-PA are higher with early concomitant systemic heparin treatment than with concomitant low-dose oral aspirin. This observation has important implications for clinical practice and should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials involving coronary thrombolytic therapy. 
Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Characterization of liver epithelial cells transfected with myc and/or ras oncogenes. While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood. Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes. The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors. The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta. It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene. The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development. 
Fatal tonsillar herniation in pseudotumor cerebri. A 27-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri died after lumbar puncture secondary to tonsillar herniation. Five years earlier she had a respiratory arrest after lumbar puncture. MRI and autopsy ruled out the presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation or a mass lesion of the posterior fossa, but midsagittal views suggested the presence of low-lying cerebellar tonsils. 
Mastoid surgery in childhood. The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed. In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%. Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%. Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy. An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease. 
Primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. Primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus is an uncommon esophageal malignancy. This report details the clinical and pathologic aspects of 11 cases seen at our institution over 20 years, as well as 123 other cases reported in the literature. Small-cell carcinomas of the esophagus show considerable histologic heterogeneity. Neurosecretory granules can be found in the majority of cases and some show evidence of multidifferentiation. Like primary small-cell cancers of the lung, those in the esophagus are highly aggressive, are usually associated with spread at the time of diagnosis, and have a dismal prognosis regardless of treatment. The possible origin of this interesting variety of esophageal neoplasm is also discussed. 
Vulvar vestibulitis: prevalence and historic features in a general gynecologic practice population. All gynecologic patients seen by the author during a 6-month period were questioned and examined by means of a swab test to determine the prevalence of vulvar vestibulitis and the normal variation in sensitivity of vestibular skin. Of 210 patients, 78 (37%) had some degree of positive testing. A total of 31 patients (15%) were found to fulfill the definition of vulvar vestibulitis. A questionnaire was administered to these patients as well as to seven patients in whom vestibulitis had been previously diagnosed. A total of 50% had always had pain, most since their teenage years. Their history was not suggestive of a cyclic or remittent pattern of symptoms. Those with secondary dyspareunia or resolution of pain were usually either in a post partum phase or had group B streptococcus or human papillomavirus. The two most severe cases of vestibulitis occurred after use of fluoroucil cream. A total of 32% had some female relative with dyspareunia or tampon intolerance, raising the issue of a genetic predisposition. 
Posterior cortical dementia with alexia: neurobehavioural, MRI, and PET findings. A progressive disorder of relatively focal but asymmetric biposterior dysfunction is described in a 54 year old right handed male. Initial clinical features included letter-by-letter alexia, visual anomia, acalculia, mild agraphia, constructional apraxia, and visuospatial compromise. Serial testing demonstrated relentless deterioration with additional development of transcortical sensory aphasia, Gerstmann's tetrad, and severe visuoperceptual impairment. Amnesia was not an early clinical feature. Judgment, personality, insight, and awareness remained preserved throughout most of the clinical course. Extinction in the right visual field to bilateral stimulation was the sole neurological abnormality. Early CT was normal and late MRI showed asymmetrical bioccipitoparietal atrophy with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Results from positron emission tomography (PET) showed bilaterally asymmetric (left greater than right) occipitotemporoparietal hypometabolism. The metabolic decrement was strikingly asymmetric with a 50% reduction in glucose consumption confined to the left occipital cortex. The picture of occipitotemporoparietal compromise verified by MRI, PET, and neurobehavioural testing would be unusual for such degenerative dementias as Alzheimer's (AD) and Pick's disease, although atypical AD with predominant occipital lobe involvement cannot be excluded. This case supports the concepts of posterior cortical dementia (PCD) as a clinically distinct entity and for the first time documents its corresponding metabolic deficit using PET. 
Acute phosphate depletion dissociates hormonal stimulated second messengers in osteoblast-like cells. The acute effect (24 h) of either phosphate depletion or phosphate surfeit on hormonal stimulated signal transduction systems was studied in the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in), induced by different calciotropic hormones (PTH, prostaglandin E2, endothelin) was blunted by acute phosphate depletion, whereas at high inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations the rise in [Ca2+]in was augmented. Basal [Ca2+]in was not altered by either Pi depletion or Pi excess. The effect of acute phosphate depletion on hormonal mediated [Ca2+]in rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggesting that under these conditions, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is not affected. Also, nonhormonal calcium entry pathways such as depolarization-activated calcium channels or protein kinase C-activated Ca2+ channels were not affected by acute phosphate depletion. cAMP accumulation in the cells, either through receptor or nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms, increased under low Pi conditions and decreased as Pi concentration in the culture media was progressively increased from 0 to 2 mM during 24 h of incubation. Changes in Pi concentration had no effect on basal cAMP generation by the cells. The facilitative effect of acute Pi depletion on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation could be demonstrated in both the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.2 mM). PTH receptor binding assessed with [Nle8 Nle18 Tyr34] bovine PTH (1-34) NH2 was not altered by phosphate depletion. We conclude that exposure of osteoblasts to different Pi environments modulates the second messenger responses to hormones in a reciprocal fashion so that acute phosphate depletion down-regulates [Ca2+]in signals while augmenting cAMP generation and vice versa. Inasmuch as bone resorption processes can be modulated by Ca2+ and cAMP the data presented herein suggest that the altered bone resorptive response to calciotropic hormones (e.g. PTH), under surfeit or deficit of phosphate, is mediated by changes in [Ca2+]in and cAMP. 
Acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis. In a series of 88 patients with acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis, 26 (30%) required emergency therapeutic intervention because of septicemic shock (n = 15), persistent fever (n = 8), or spreading peritonitis (n = 3). Analysis was made to define factors that predisposed to failure of conservative treatment and characteristics that could predict the need for emergency biliary decompression. The age, incidence of concomitant medical diseases, previous biliary surgery, positive blood culture, bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics used, and multiplicity of bacterial strains in bile cultures in patients who required emergency intervention were similar to these factors in patients who had elective operations after successful conservative management. The incidence of intrahepatic segmental obstruction by stones or strictures was similar, but many more patients who required emergency intervention had concomitant extrahepatic obstruction due to impacted common ductal stones or strictures. Logistic regression analysis of clinical, hematological, and biochemical data showed that maximum pulse rate within 24 hours of presentation (greater than 100 beats per minute, relative risk, 2.8) and platelet count at the time of admission (less than 150 x 10(9)/L, relative risk, 5.2) were the factors with independent significance in predicting the need for emergency therapeutic procedures. This finding may serve as a guideline for identifying high-risk patients for early intervention. 
Update on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The major components of atherosclerotic plaque, ultimately responsible for clinical effects, are deposited lipids--mostly cholesteryl esters and cholesterol, derived largely from the lower-density lipoproteins of the blood--and proliferated, modified arterial smooth muscle cells with their synthesized connective tissue products. Advanced plaques vary widely in the proportion of the two components, but evidence indicates that lipid deposition--especially of lipoprotein elements--often occurs in the lesion-prone intimal areas of the artery prior to the buildup of smooth muscle cells. The 1980s were remarkably productive for investigators who study the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We now know of the many forms of lower-density lipoproteins, i.e., low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), some of which are more likely to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and some of which are more likely to be influenced by diet. Among these forms of LDL and VLDL are LDL-1, beta-VLDL, and Lp(a). Work has been reported implicating various alterations of endothelial function in the permeability of the arterial endothelial barrier in the transport of these low-density, cholesterol-rich macromolecules. Of possibly greater interest is the developing evidence that such proliferation-stimulating molecules as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be produced by a number of cells likely to be involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition to platelets, these include activated monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, injured endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, which can undergo an autocrine conversion to PDGF synthesis--possibly stimulated by LDL from hyperlipidemic serum. Leukotrienes and other endothelium-associated regulatory molecules may also take part in the paracrine and autocrine mechanisms of stimulating smooth-muscle-cell proliferation. Additional recent developments that have led to a better understanding of atherosclerotic pathogenesis have occurred. The first is evidence of the involvement of oxidized LDL and its apolipoprotein B in atherogenesis. Research indicates that antioxidants have a suppressive effect on atherogenesis when oxidized LDL has been involved in lesion development. The data linking the development of autoimmune reactions to these oxidatively altered lipoproteins are also impressive. Further, there is increasing evidence that atherogenesis in nonhuman primates and in people in whom chronic sustained circulating immune complexes are involved is likely to be accelerated, even when few or no classic risk factors are present. These lesions appear to represent a distinct microarchitectural form of concentric and transmural atherosclerosis that is better classified as "atheroarteritis.". 
Lack of predictive value of the APACHE II score in hypoalbuminemic patients. The APACHE II score predicts mortality in severely ill patients. This score does not account for the serum albumin level. Ninety-three patients (28 with serum albumin levels less than 2.5 g/dL [group I] and 65 with serum albumin levels greater than or equal to 2.5 [group II]) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were comparable in age, APACHE II score, and compliance with required protein needs. Patients with severe hypoalbuminemia had nearly double the death rate of patients with mildly low or normal albumin concentrations (54% compared with 29%). The death rate in the severely hypoalbuminemic patients was 5.1-fold higher than would be predicted by their APACHE II score. The death rate in those patients with mildly low or normal albumin levels had only a 1.9-fold higher rate than would be predicted by their APACHE II score. It is concluded that severe hypoalbuminemia increases the risk of death significantly higher than would be predicted by the APACHE II score. APACHE II score is not as accurate in a severely hypoalbuminemic population. 
Preservation of aortic valve in type A aortic dissection complicated by aortic regurgitation. Two hundred fifty-two patients underwent operation for type A aortic dissection at Stanford University Medical Center from 1963 to 1987 and Duke University Medical Center from 1975 to 1988. Sixty-seven percent had an acute type A dissection and 33% had a chronic type A dissection. In addition to repair or replacement of the ascending aorta, 121 patients (48%) required an aortic valve procedure. Valve resuspension was performed in 46 (39 acute type A and 7 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 13% +/- 5% (+/- 70% confidence limits), and aortic valve replacement in 75 (36 acute type A and 39 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 20% +/- 5% (p = not significant versus resuspension). The operative mortality rate for patients requiring only repair or replacement of the ascending aorta was 32% +/- 4%. Indications for valve replacement included coexistent (nonacute) aortic valve disease, Marfan's syndrome, annuloaortic ectasia, and cases in which successful resuspension could not be accomplished. The overall actuarial survival rate for all patients was 59% +/- 3% (+/- 1 standard error of the mean), 40% +/- 4%, and 25% +/- 5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Survival rates at these same times for patients with valve resuspension were 67% +/- 8%, 52% +/- 10%, and 26% +/- 19%, respectively; for patients who required aortic valve replacement, these survival rates were 70% +/- 5%, 39% +/- 8%, and 21% +/- 11%; finally, patients who received only an ascending aortic procedure had survival probabilities of 51% +/- 5%, 37% +/- 6%, and 23% +/- 6% (p = not significant versus resuspension versus aortic valve replacement). Multivariate analysis showed advanced age (p less than 0.001), previous cardiac or aortic operation (p less than 0.001), more preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.002), and earlier operative date (p = 0.038) to be the only significant, independent factors that increased the likelihood of early or late death. The type of aortic valve procedure (resuspension versus aortic valve replacement versus none) was not a significant predictor of mortality. Two of 46 patients with valve resuspension required late aortic valve replacement (freedom from aortic valve replacement: 100% and 80% +/- 13% at 5 and 10 years, respectively), as did 4 of 75 patients with initial aortic valve replacement (freedom from repeat aortic valve replacement: 98% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 13%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Fetal breathing and development of control of breathing. Technical advances during the last several decades have greatly facilitated research into fetal physiology and behavior, specifically fetal breathing (FB). Breathing movements have been demonstrated in the fetuses of every mammalian species investigated and appear to be part of normal fetal development. In this review we focus on the methods of measuring FB and on some of the problems associated with these measurements and their interpretation. We also review fetal behavior, the role of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in spontaneous FB, the fetal respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the transition to continuous breathing at birth. It is clear that in many ways the control of breathing movements in utero differs from that after birth. In particular, inhibitory influences are much more prominent before than after birth. Possibly this is due to the unique fetal situation, in which conservation of energy may be more important than any advantage breathing activity imparts to the fetus. 
Histological and immunohistochemical study of the gall bladder lesion in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The histological features and type of mononuclear cell infiltrate in gall bladders from six patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied using routine staining techniques and immunohistochemistry. Control studies were performed using the gall bladders from six patients (age and sex matched) with chronic cholecystitis and four with primary biliary cirrhosis. A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate. 
Testolactone, sulindac, warfarin, and vitamin K1 for unresectable desmoid tumors. Ten patients with large inoperable desmoid tumors in various body locations were treated with testolactone. Four tumors (40%) responded with major regressions, i.e., more than 50% reduction in volume. Eight patients received nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, sulindac, or sulindac with warfarin and vitamin K1 [Mephyton]) for periods of 2 to 91 months. There was one major regression, one partial regression, and three instances of tumor growth arrest over periods up to 8 years. Seven patients were treated with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs concurrent with or after testolactone or tamoxifen. There were five major regressions and one partial regression with extensive central necrosis of an enormous intra-abdominal tumor. The last patient has been treated for only 12 months, with no change in tumor volume. It appears that estrogens function as growth factors for desmoid tumors, and that minimization of these effects inhibits tumor growth in some, but not all, cases. In those instances where antiestrogens were not effective as single agents, the tumors usually responded to subsequent nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Withdrawal of estrogen may be followed by inhibition of transcription of genes that support tumor cell proliferation, and sulindac and indomethacin may augment these effects by inhibiting prostaglandin and cyclic AMP synthesis and the activity of protein kinase C. Warfarin may function as a protonophore to acidify the cytoplasm and prevent the alkalinization that is necessary to initiate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, again an impairment of the transcription process. 
The clinical heterogeneity of hypertension. More than the character of the blood pressure elevation, the cardiovascular risk profile should be the prognostic guide for antihypertensive therapeutic decision-making. Hypertension tends to occur in association with other risk factors which augment the risk and need to be considered in evaluating the hazard of hypertension, the urgency for treatment, and the choice of treatment. Elevated blood pressure is often accompanied by blood lipid abnormality, obesity, electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormality, glucose intolerance, and elevated fibrinogen and hematocrit, all of which enhance the risk of cardiovascular sequelae of hypertension. Hypertensive patients at particularly increased risk of cardiovascular events are those with an increased total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, ECG abnormality, impaired glucose tolerance, or the cigarette smoking habit. The risk of a cardiovascular event among hypertensive patients varies over more than a 10-fold range depending on the number of these coexistent risk factors. Multivariate risk formulations are available to allow a composite estimate of the joint conditional probability of a cardiovascular outcome in hypertensive patients with multiple risk factors. Since some antihypertensive agents can adversely affect blood lipids, glucose tolerance, or uric acid values, the risk profile must also be taken into account in choosing the optimal antihypertensive therapy. Also, hypertension is commonly associated with angina, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke, or cardiac failure. These too must be taken under consideration in judging the urgency for treatment and the choice of agents. Thus, hypertension is best regarded as a component of a cardiovascular risk profile in implementing optimal therapy and in assessing its efficacy. 
Comparative efficacy of daptomycin, vancomycin, and cloxacillin for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in rats and role of test conditions in this determination. The in vivo efficacy of daptomycin, a new cell wall-active anti-gram-positive-bacterial agent, was compared to those of cloxacillin and vancomycin in a rat model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were used. When therapy was initiated early (8 h) after infection, at the time when valvular bacterial counts were relatively low (approximately 10(6) CFU/g of vegetation), 3 days of therapy was found to be effective against the MSSA strains whatever the antibiotic regimen. In contrast, when the onset of therapy was delayed up to 15 h after infection, so that higher bacterial counts could develop on the valves (approximately 10(9) CFU/g of vegetation), a longer period of treatment (6 days) was required to cure infection. Under these conditions after 3 days of therapy, daptomycin was more effective than cloxacillin and vancomycin against the MSSA strains. Similarly, daptomycin showed a greater activity than vancomycin against the MRSA strain after 3 days of treatment, but after 6 days both antibiotics were equally effective. Decreasing doses of daptomycin showed decreasing activity: 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h (q12h) was better than 5 mg/kg q12h, whereas 5 mg/kg q24h (providing drug levels in blood detectable only during the first 12 h) failed to cure infection. In vitro, daptomycin was highly bactericidal at high concentrations (25 and 60 micrograms/ml, corresponding to peak levels in serum after doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and bacteriostatic at lower concentrations (0.5 to 2.5 micrograms/ml, corresponding to trough levels in serum). 
9p monosomy in a patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit disorder. Family studies support the presence of an autosomal dominant gene; however, to date, an assignment for the GTS locus has not been made. We present the case of a boy with GTS and a deletion of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9, del(9)(qter----p2304:). 
Are there interactions and relations between genetic and environmental factors predisposing to high blood pressure? An overview of published observations suggests that both genetic predisposition and environment work together to produce hypertension in most persons. High blood pressure before age 55 occurs 3.8 times more often among persons with a strong positive family history of high blood pressure. Much of the total variability in blood pressure in modern populations seems attributable to genetic factors. Estimates of the proportion of the variance attributable to all genetic factors (heritability [H2]) vary from 25% in pedigree studies to 65% in twin studies for sitting diastolic blood pressure. Several biochemical traits associated with high blood pressure are highly genetic (H2, 78-84%) and may help elucidate the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. While pertinent environmental factors such as salt intake, alcohol use, and amount of exercise also correlate significantly among relatives, only 7% of the total variance of diastolic blood pressure seems attributable to all shared environmental factors in family households. Thus most familial aggregation of high blood pressure appears to be due to genes rather than shared family environment. Practical benefit may result from identifying familial predisposition in multiple siblings with high blood pressure before age 55 and lipid abnormalities (labeled "familial dyslipidemic hypertension"). About 12% of high blood pressure patients have familial dyslipidemic hypertension and also have high risk of early coronary heart disease. Hyperinsulinemia and central obesity as well as high triglycerides and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol are prominent features of familial dyslipidemic hypertension. 
Piezoelectric biliary lithotripsy: an in vitro study of factors affecting gallstone fragmentation. Factors affecting the fragmentation of gallstones with piezoelectric lithotripsy were studied in vitro, with a goal of providing data that will help direct treatment with piezoelectric lithotriptors. Two hundred fifty-seven stones from 50 patients were treated with the EDAP LT.O1 lithotriptor until all fragments measured 2 mm or less in diameter. The fragmentation process was observed, and two patterns were evident: central fragmentation and peripheral chipping. The majority of stones fragmented centrally. Fragmentation characteristics in different stones from the same patient were compared with those from different patients. Stone diameter, shock-wave frequency and power, and CT appearance were examined and correlated with fragmentation. Gallstones from the same patient showed uniform fragmentation patterns and consistent relationships between fragmentation time and gallstone size, shock-wave frequency, and power. In stones from the same patient, gallstone size had a marked effect on fragmentation time, which correlated with the cube of the stone diameter, and shock-wave frequency and power had a proportional inverse linear relationship with fragmentation time. When controlling for stone size and treatment parameters, stones from multiple patients showed marked differences in fragmentation time, and because of this, poor correlation between stone size and fragmentation time. Stones grouped according to CT pattern and attenuation showed wide variation and no correlation between CT characteristics and fragmentation pattern or fragmentation time. Our results show that a great variability exists in fragmentation time of gallstones, making it impossible to accurately predict fragmentation time at a given stone size. Only rough estimates of longer fragmentation times with increasing stone size can be made. The linear relationships between shock-wave frequency or power and fragmentation time allow one to easily predict the effect of manipulating these variables and to tailor treatment to each patient's tolerance. Finally, CT appearance does not appear to be predictive of fragmentation outcome. 
Prospects for the use of antagonists to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor to prevent post-angioplasty restenosis and thrombosis. Despite many advances since its inception in humans in 1977, coronary angioplasty continues to be limited by the problems of abrupt arterial closure and late restenosis. Excessive platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty undoubtedly plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both of these problems. Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function. Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty. 
Muscle damage induced by eccentric contractions of 25% strain. Contractile and morphological properties were measured in the rabbit tibialis anterior muscle 1 h after isometric contraction (IC), passive stretch (PS), or eccentric contraction (EC). Maximal tetanic tension (Po) was reduced after 30 min of PS (P less than 0.001), IC (P less than 0.001), or EC (P less than 0.0001). However, the magnitude of the force deficit was a function of the treatment method. After 30 min of cyclic PS, Po decreased by 13%, whereas after IC or EC, Po decreased by 31 and 69%, respectively. The time course of tension decline in the various groups suggested that the EC-induced injury occurred during the first few minutes of treatment. Although the morphology of samples from the PS and IC groups appeared normal, eccentrically exercised muscles exhibited portions of abnormally large fibers (diam greater than or equal to 110 microns) when viewed in cross section. Examination of 231 such fibers from 6 muscles revealed that all enlarged fibers were exclusively of the fast-twitch glycolytic fiber type. Although no ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in any of the muscles from the IC or PS groups, a significant portion of the fibers in the EC group displayed various degrees of disorganization of the sarcomeric band pattern. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of fiber oxidative capacity in EC-induced injury, which may be related to the damage mechanism. 
Diaphragmatic performance during recovery from acute ventilatory failure in Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis. Diaphragmatic muscle performance during acute ventilatory failure due to Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis was assessed to evaluate (1) diaphragmatic function during weaning from ventilatory support and (2) diaphragmatic tension-time integral (TTdi) during ventilatory failure. We used a multilumen nasogastric tube and a pneumotachograph to measure transdiaphragmatic pressure per breath (Pdi), maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax), tidal volume (VT), and inspiratory time fraction during 74 spontaneous breathing trials in nine patients. Diaphragmatic performance was poor in all patients. The Pdi, Pdimax, and VT improved significantly, but values for Pdi and Pdimax remained low even after weaning. Improvement in Pdimax was the best predictor of recovery (r = 0.48; p less than 0.001). Maximal inspiratory force correlated with Pdimax (r = 0.48; p less than 0.005), but FVC did not. The TTdi rarely exceeded the expected fatigue threshold of 0.15 in spite of the patient's inability to sustain ventilation. Although our patients demonstrated diaphragmatic weakness, TTdi did not demonstrate diaphragmatic fatigue. 
Cavernomas of the central nervous system: clinical and neuroimaging manifestations in 47 patients. Forty seven cases of central nervous system cavernous angioma (21 males and 26 females) are described. The main clinical signs were epilepsy and brainstem syndromes. Digital subtraction intra-arterial angiography, when used, failed to reveal cavernoma. CT detected many of the lesions, but the most successful supplementary diagnostic procedure was MRI which produces highly characteristic images of cavernous angioma. The diagnosis of cavernous angioma was confirmed in the 18 cases in which the tumour was removed surgically. 
A new approach to the resection of pulmonary osteosarcoma metastases. Results of aggressive metastasectomy. Pulmonary metastases are the primary cause of death from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. Recognition that even multiple resections of metastases can improve survival has led to a more aggressive surgical approach to these patients. The authors instituted an aggressive approach and a new technique and retrospectively analyzed the results of multiple, pulmonary metastasectomies for pulmonary metastases in 34 patients, 21 of whom had osteogenic sarcoma (OGS). A number of cases were referred from other institutions, where they had been considered inoperable because of extensive or recurrent disease. Using lateral thoracotomies, laser technique with minimal parenchymal excision, and thin gloves for palpation, aggressive metastectomy was carried out. A mean of 3.1 thoracotomies were performed, with an average of 10.6 nodules resected per thoracotomy. Operative morbidity and mortality were minimal. Evaluation of potential prognostic factors revealed no statistically significant survival difference on the basis of disease-free interval (DFI), number of nodules resected, number of thoracotomies, or size of largest nodule resected. There was a clear trend toward decreased survival of patients with larger nodules (greater than 2 cm), but because of the small number of patients in this group, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Five-year survival was 49% for the study group as a whole, and 39% for the OGS patients. Aggressive surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma should be considered when there is control of local disease, no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis, and adequate postresection pulmonary reserve. The presence of bilateral, extensive, or recurrent disease is not a contraindication to thoracotomy. 
Adult chronic lead intoxication. A clinical review. A stained-glass artisan with depression and a retired junkyard worker with congestive cardiomyopathy had increased mobilizable body burdens of lead by calcium ethylenediaminetetaacetic acid testing. Although both patients improved with several months of intramuscular chelation therapy, the efficacy of such therapy in chronic lead poisoning is controversial. Recognition of unusual manifestations of chronic lead poisoning may at least interrupt further exposure, even if specific therapy is not undertaken. 
Translaminar facet joint screw fixation for lumbar and lumbosacral fusion. A clinical and biomechanical study. Various systems of supplementing bone grafts with internal fixation in the lumbosacral spine have been used in an effort to improve fusion rates. This study reports biomechanical data of cyclic loading cadaveric spines instrumented with translaminar facet screws as well as early clinical results on this technique. Static loading tests comparing uninstrumented and instrumented spinal motion units show that a ninefold increase in flexion load is necessary for constant displacement after facet screw fixation. Repetitive loading tests show only a small decrease in stiffness of instrumented segments even after 5,000 cycles. To date, 35 patients have undergone fusion by this technique as performed by one surgeon. After excluding Workers' Compensation cases and cases with less than 2 years follow-up, there were 18 cases available for review. Twelve of these 18 cases were two-level fusions. Ten patients underwent concomitant discectomy or nerve root decompression. There were no cases of iatrogenic neurologic injury or pseudoarthrosis. It is concluded that translaminar facet screws have a sound biomechanical basis and are a valuable addition to lumbar fusion procedures. 
Autoantibodies to the presumptive cytoplasmic domain of platelet glycoprotein IIIa in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder due to autoantibodies against platelets that result in their destruction. In some patients, these autoantibodies bind to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. With the aim of better defining the antigenic epitopes, plasma from 13 selected patients with chronic ITP known to have anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies was tested for reactivity with nine synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the GP IIIa molecule. Of these plasmas, five bound significantly (P less than .001) with either peptide 8 (amino acids 721-744) or peptide 9 (amino acids 742-762), which together form most of the carboxyterminal region presumed to be the cytoplasmic domain. Three of these positive plasmas, were tested further. In two of these positive plasmas, the anti-peptide antibodies represented greater than 80% of the detectable circulating autoantibody. To further evaluate the importance of the carboxyterminal region as an antigenic site, the chronic ITP plasmas were tested against Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GPIIb and either whole GPIIIa or GPIIIa lacking amino acids 728 to 762. Ten of the 13 plasmas required the presence of this region for significant autoantibody binding. We conclude that the carboxyterminal region is an important area for stimulating antiplatelet autoantibody formation in some patients with chronic ITP. It is not known whether these autoantibodies to the presumed cytoplasmic domain play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease or occur as a secondary phenomenon during the course of platelet destruction. 
Reversible and irreversible elongation of ischemic, infarcted, and healed myocardium in response to increases in preload and afterload. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular aneurysm formation after myocardial infarction (MI) has been associated with elongation of infarcted tissue in response to wall stress. Such elongation most commonly occurs in acutely infarcted or partially healed regions during the early post-MI period; however, recent reports have indicated that mature (15-week-old) healed infarct regions also undergo elongation after stress. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess factors contributing to post-MI left ventricular aneurysm formation, we subjected isolated strips (n = 50) of rabbit myocardial tissue from acutely ischemic (noninfarcted left ventricular), acutely infarcted (24 hours after MI), and healed infarct (3 and 15 weeks after MI) regions to a range of loading conditions and measured the reversible and irreversible length changes that occurred. The isolated strips were repetitively stretched for 1 hour at 4 Hz to impose cyclical physiological peak and resting stresses of 2.0 and 0.2 g/mm2. During a second hour, either peak stress ("afterload") or resting stress ("preload") was tripled, and the increase in strip length (strain) was measured. During a third hour, peak and resting stresses were returned to the initial values to assess the reversibility of length changes occurring during increased load. Elongation was expressed as the increase in natural strain from the first hour. Increasing afterload caused similar irreversible length increases of 4-5%/hr in acutely infarcted and 3- and 15-week-old healed infarct strips; acutely ischemic tissue length increased by 7.4%/hr (p less than 0.05 versus acutely infarcted tissue and scars). Increasing preload in acutely ischemic and acutely infarcted tissue caused a reversible length increase of less than 1%/hr. (Scar strips were not tested for the effect of preload.) CONCLUSIONS. Since an irreversible length increase may represent an early event in aneurysm formation, our results suggest that 1) afterload increases are more likely to lead to aneurysm development than preload increases, 2) acutely ischemic tissue is the most vulnerable to increased afterload, and 3) for a given wall stress level, healing scar tissue is as susceptible to irreversible length changes as is acutely infarcted tissue. The observation that even mature post-MI scar elongated in response to increases in afterload implies that long-term pharmacological management of afterload in post-MI patients may be beneficial in preventing tissue elongation and aneurysm formation and that factors that increase wall stress (e.g., hypertension and exercise stress) have the potential to promote aneurysm formation in healed infarct scars. 
Status epilepticus in benign rolandic epilepsy manifesting as anterior operculum syndrome. We report the fourth case of partial status epilepticus (SE) in benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS). The child suffered long-lasting attacks involving the mouth and pharynx, clinically manifest as speech arrest, sialorrhea, and drooling. Both clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were compatible with the diagnosis of BECRS. Only during SE was the clinical picture similar to that observed in the operculum or Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome. SE remission was obtained with the usual antiepileptic drug therapy (diazepam, clobazam, valproate). EEG records showed additional patterns of continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and specific inhibition and blocking of interictal centrotemporal spikes by mouth and/or tongue voluntary movements. 
Differences in electrophysiological substrate in patients with coronary artery disease and cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia. Insights from endocardial mapping and signal-averaged electrocardiography. BACKGROUND. Many studies have combined patients with hemodynamically well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and those with cardiac arrest (CA) as a single, homogenous group. Recent studies suggest that these two groups have different electrophysiological substrates and responses to therapy. Most of these studies, however, enrolled patients with a variety of cardiac diagnoses. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) and endocardial catheter mapping to define the electrophysiological substrate in patients with coronary artery disease and VT or CA and correlate the results of the two methods. We also examined the usefulness of SAECG in CA patients to differentiate those with inducible arrhythmias from those who are noninducible. VT patients were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.0005) and to have inducible arrhythmias (p = 0.0001) than were CA patients. The induced arrhythmias in patients who presented with VT was VT in more than 90% of cases, whereas in CA patients, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) accounted for one third of induced arrhythmias. Mean filtered QRS duration was longer (135 versus 120 msec) and the terminal QRS voltage was smaller (20 versus 34 microV) in VT than in CA patients (p less than 0.01). Sixty-three percent of CA patients and 87% of VT patients had abnormal SAECG (p = 0.001). VT patients had more extensive endocardial abnormalities and more abnormal (53% versus 40%, p = 0.002), fractionated (8% versus 3%, p = 0.02), late (17% versus 8%, p = 0.0003), and late abnormal or fractionated (14% versus 4%, p = 0.0001) sites than CA patients. VT patients had a greater duration of the longest electrogram (129 versus 109 msec, p = 0.0006) and total endocardial activation time (68 versus 54 msec, p = 0.009). Among CA patients, those with induced VT had more extensive substrate than did those with induced PMVT and were similar to VT patients with induced VT. Among CA patients, the trend for more patients with inducible VT (77%) or PMVT (55%) than noninducible patients (47%) to have an abnormal SAECG did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14). The positive and negative predictive values of an abnormal SAECG were 77% and 44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. VT patients have more extensive endocardial substrate than CA patients, which translates into greater and more frequent SAECG abnormalities. Among CA patients, there are significant differences in substrate between patients with induced VT and those with induced PMVT. SAECG is not useful in differentiating CA patients who have inducible VT or PMVT from those who do not. 
Long-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). 
Ureteral pseudodiverticula: frequent association with uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula are tiny outpouchings usually seen as incidental findings on retrograde urography during routine work-up for common urinary tract disorders. We report 37 patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula, of whom 17 (46%) had associated uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula were diagnosed in all patients on excretory or retrograde urography as an incidental finding during evaluation for a variety of urologic symptoms and signs. All patients were assessed with urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, and when indicated, ureteroscopy. Diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made by surgery or endoscopic biopsy in 16 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in one. In nine patients with radiographs showing ureteral pseudodiverticula and a urinary tract filling defect (usually in the bladder), 78% of the cases were proved malignant. In six patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture in the ureter or renal collecting system, 67% of the cases were proved malignant. Of the patients with tumor, 53% had a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum. In two cases, the pseudodiverticula antedated the diagnosis of malignancy by 2 and 4 years, respectively. Our experience suggests that the association between ureteral pseudodiverticula and uroepithelial malignancy may be more common than previously assumed, approaching 50%. Even a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum should be regarded as a serious marker for potential malignancy, antedating cancer by 2-10 years, and such patients should be closely followed up. The coexistence of ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture or filling defect in the urinary tract is highly suggestive that a tumor is present. 
Omenn's syndrome and related combined immunodeficiency syndromes: diagnostic considerations in infants with persistent erythroderma and failure to thrive. A 4-month-old male infant had a 2-month history of an exfoliative erythroderma and alopecia. Recurrent mucosal infections, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, anemia, and failure to thrive later developed. Investigation revealed a combined immunodeficiency with T cells of an unusual phenotype in his peripheral blood, skin, and lymph nodes. Our patient's clinical manifestations most closely resemble Omenn's syndrome, a rare form of autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency. 
Benefits of implantable defibrillators are overestimated by sudden death rates and better represented by the total arrhythmic death rate Benefits of the implantable defibrillator on survival were studied in 56 consecutive patients (concomitant coronary bypass or arrythmia surgery in 15) during an 8 year period between 1982 and 1990. During a follow-up period of 29 +/- 25 months, six patients had a sudden death and eight patients had a nonsudden cardiac death. Nonsudden cardiac deaths included three surgical deaths (death within 30 days after the surgery; two in patients without and one in a patient with concomitant cardiac surgery), one arrhythmia-related nonsudden death (death within 24 h after an arrhythmic event despite initial termination of the arrhythmia by the implantable defibrillators) and four nonarrhythmic cardiac deaths. The actuarial survival rate free of events at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for sudden death, 91%, 91% and 87% for sudden death and surgical mortality and 89%, 89% and 85% for total arrhythmic death (sudden death, surgical mortality and arrhythmia-related nonsudden death). Thus, in patients treated with an implantable defibrillator, 1) the rate of sudden death is low (8% at 3 years); 2) 50% of nonsudden cardiac deaths are causally related to arrhythmia (surgical mortality or arrhythmia-related nonsudden death); 3) the total arrhythmic death rate is substantially higher than the sudden death rate; and 4) benefits of an implantable defibrillator are overestimated by reported sudden death and nonsudden cardiac death rates. The benefits may be better represented by the total arrhythmic death and nonarrhythmic cardiac death rates. 
Experience with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty and a rotary angioplasty instrument: lessons learned. Favorable early results with mechanical angioplasty devices and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty have resulted in aggressive marketing and a rapid increase in the use of these devices for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Methodologic issues in maintenance therapy clinical trials. In the early 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health supported a multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial on unipolar and bipolar disorder to evaluate the comparative efficacies of lithium carbonate, imipramine hydrochloride, a lithium-imipramine combination, and placebo in preventing the recurrence of affective disorders. The objective of this report is to present a reanalysis of the relative efficacies of these treatments in patients with unipolar disorder to focus attention on general issues related to the design and conduct of maintenance therapy trials. We show that the earlier conclusions of that study that imipramine and the combination therapy are more effective than lithium and placebo in preventing the recurrence of depression in unipolar patients can be accounted for by alternative explanations that are a consequence of the design of the study. Our findings have important implications for the design, conduct, and interpretation of results of maintenance therapy clinical trials in general. 
Effects of immunosuppressive therapy in biopsy-proved myocarditis and borderline myocarditis on left ventricular function. Twenty patients with decreased left ventricular (LV) function and endomyocardial biopsy-proved myocarditis (9 patients) or borderline myocarditis (11 patients) were studied to determine whether these 2 histologic subsets of patients with inflammatory heart disease differed in their response to a 6- to 8-week course of immunosuppressive therapy. All patients received a regimen of prednisone, 1.0 mg/kg/day, and azathioprine, 1.5 mg/kg/day, followed by repeat endomyocardial biopsy and reevaluation of LV function. LV function improved significantly in the group with borderline myocarditis, as assessed by LV stroke work--end-diastolic volume ratio (0.26 +/- 0.17 to 0.54 +/- 0.31 kg.m.ml-1, p less than 0.02), heart rate corrected velocity of circumferential shortening (0.49 +/- 0.30 to 0.80 +/- 0.29 circ.s-1, p less than 0.05), and LV ejection fraction (0.30 +/- 0.15 to 0.47 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes also decreased significantly from 129 +/- 40 to 94 +/- 38 (p less than 0.05) and 90 +/- 37 to 49 +/- 26 ml (p less than 0.02), respectively. No significant change in these indexes of LV function or volume occurred in the myocarditis group. Whereas salutory improvements in cardiac output and filling pressures were found in both groups, objective improvement in LV function assessed by complementary indexes of contractility was greatest in the borderline myocarditis group. It is concluded that short-term immunosuppressive therapy improves LV contractile function and appears to be associated with regression of ventricular dilatation in patients with borderline myocarditis to a greater extent than patients with myocarditis. 
Monitoring of upper oesophageal sphincter pressure in children. In children technical limitations of upper oesophageal sphincter manometry have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In this study we have used an adapted sleeve manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined the influence of the state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17.5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual sleeve manometric assemblies which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67% of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0.0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18.1 (10.3) mmHg and highest in category D 55.7 (13.2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children. 
Long-term function in University of Cape Town prostheses in the tricuspid position. A 55-year-old woman undergoing triple-valve replacement was found at operation to have a well preserved and functioning University of Cape Town prosthesis that had been inserted 18 years earlier for tricuspid stenosis. Case reporting, valve reappraisal, and factual updating on another case, the world's first documented tricuspid valve replacement for Ebstein's anomaly, are presented. These two remarkable in vivo successes speak well for this historic collar stud valve. 
A simple biological index for detection of alcoholic liver disease in drinkers. To make liver biopsy unnecessary in certain cases, PGA (P, prothrombin time; G, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; A, apoliprotein AI), a simple biological index combining a specific test for severe liver disease (prothrombin time), a sensitive test of alcoholic liver disease (serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), and a test for liver fibrosis (serum apolipoprotein AI), was evaluated in a training sample of 333 drinkers and validated in 291 other drinkers. All patients underwent an intercostal liver biopsy, and the specimen was independently read by two pathologists. The PGA index varied from 0 to 12. When PGA was less than or equal to 2, the probability of cirrhosis was 0% and the probability of normal liver or minimal changes 83%. Conversely, when PGA was greater than or equal to 9, the probability of normal liver or minimal changes was 0% and the probability of cirrhosis 86%. These values did not vary between training and validation periods, between asymptomatic vs. symptomatic subjects or between PGA at admission vs. PGA 1 week later. This index could be useful for general practitioners in identifying subjects at high risk for severe alcoholic liver disease. 
Acute fulminant hepatic failure. Fulminant hepatic failure is the rapid onset of life-threatening hepatic decompensation in patients who have no previous history of liver disease. This condition has a multifactorial etiology, including viral hepatitis and drug toxicity. At this time there is no specific therapy for FHF. However, early diagnosis and treatment of the complications--in particular, cerebral edema--may prolong survival and prevent irreversible neurologic complications. Once the diagnosis has been made, patients with FHF should promptly be transferred to a specialized liver care unit where liver transplantation is available. Liver transplantation is now the treatment of choice for patients with clinical characteristics suggesting a poor chance of survival. 
Age-related normal values of signal-averaged electrocardiographic variables after acute myocardial infarction. The study examined standard time domain variables of a signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in 328 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The correlation of these variables with age and the influence of age on the prediction of postinfarction arrhythmic complication (sudden death [n = 12] or sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both [n = 14]) from the SAECG were investigated. Statistically highly significant correlations (p less than or equal to 0.00002) between age and SAECG variables were found. Compared with patients aged less than 60 years, the SAECG-based stratification of arrhythmic complications after myocardial infarction in patients greater than 60 years had lower sensitivity for the same values of specificity and lower specificity for the same values of sensitivity. 
Gallium-SPECT in the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis and aortic ring abscess. A 52-yr-old man who had a bioprosthetic aortic valve developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Despite antibiotic therapy he had persistent pyrexia and developed new conduction system disturbances. Echocardiography did not demonstrate vegetations on the valve or an abscess, but gallium scintigraphy using SPECT clearly identified a focus of intense activity in the region of the aortic valve. The presence of valvular vegetations and a septal abscess was confirmed at autopsy. Gallium scintigraphy, using SPECT, provided a useful noninvasive method for the demonstration of endocarditis and the associated valve ring abscess. 
Pain in sickle cell disease. Rates and risk factors. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Acute episodes of pain are the principal symptom of sickle cell disease, but little is known about the epidemiologic features of these episodes or risk factors for them, nor is it known whether patients with high rates of such episodes die prematurely. We prospectively studied the natural history of sickle cell disease in 3578 patients ranging from newborns to persons up to 66 years old who were followed at clinical centers across the United States. RESULTS. There were 12,290 episodes of pain in 18,356 patient-years. The average rate was 0.8 episode per patient-year in sickle cell anemia, 1.0 episode per patient-year in sickle beta 0-thalassemia, and 0.4 episode per patient-year in hemoglobin SC disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia. The rate varied widely within each of these four groups--e.g., 39 percent of patients with sickle cell anemia had no episodes of pain, and 1 percent had more than six episodes per year. The 5.2 percent of patients with 3 to 10 episodes per year had 32.9 percent of all episodes. Among patients with sickle cell anemia who were more than 20 years old, those with high rates of pain episodes tended to die earlier than those with low rates. High rates were associated with a high hematocrit and low fetal hemoglobin levels. alpha-Thalassemia had no effect on pain apart from its association with an increased hematocrit. CONCLUSIONS. The "pain rate" (episodes per year) is a measure of clinical severity and correlates with early death in patients with sickle cell anemia over the age of 20. Even when the fetal hemoglobin level is low, one can predict that small increments in the level may have an ameliorating effect on the pain rate and may ultimately improve survival. This outcome is particularly encouraging to investigators studying hydroxyurea and other treatments designed to increase the fetal hemoglobin level. 
Clinical findings associated with pulmonary embolism in a rehabilitation setting. In a rehabilitation setting, pulmonary embolism is a relatively frequent and life-threatening complication. Deciding when a patient may be experiencing this condition is difficult, however, because of frequent deficits in patient communication skills (eg, aphasia and cognitive deficits) and the multisystem illnesses affecting many rehabilitation patients. We reviewed the charts of 30 rehabilitation patients transferred emergently during the years 1986 to 1988 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently documented by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The average age of the 30 patients was 65; 63% were women and 20 (67%) had an admitting diagnosis of stroke. The most common new-onset clinical findings in the 24 hours before discharge were unusual facial skin color changes (pale, flushed, or cyanotic) (57%), chest or upper back pain (47%), tachycardia (heart rate more than 100 bpm) (40%), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) (40%), and fever less than 101F (37%). In 63% of the patients, either anxiety, restlessness, diaphoresis, or dyspnea was also noted in the 24 hours before discharge. The data suggest that careful physician and nursing scrutiny may identify clinical signs characteristic of pulmonary embolism, and that the de novo appearance of these constellations of findings may help to select candidates for ventilation-perfusion scanning. 
Peritonitis after cecal perforation. An experimental model to study the therapeutic role of antibiotics associated with allopurinol and catalase. This work uses cecal perforation on the rat as a model of intra-abdominal sepsis. Under these conditions, various antibiotics were tested alone or in association with free radical scavengers, such as allopurinol and catalase. It can be concluded that the scavengers were not effective alone, but when combined with antibiotics they rendered good results in the majority of the groups when given postsepsis. Further studies are needed to determine the real role of agents like the free radical scavengers in infectious situations such as the one discussed here. 
Transient corneal opacification induced by cold in Raynaud's disease. A 48-year-old man presented with longstanding complaints of transient blurring of vision on exposure to cold temperatures. A review of family history was noteworthy in that two of the patient's four sons and the patient's brother had similar complaints. All affected individuals had Raynaud's disease. Results of ophthalmic evaluation showed transient corneal opacities. Slit-lamp video photography under cold stress demonstrated conjunctival vascular changes consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon. An extensive work-up for systemic disease was otherwise negative. To the best of the authors' knowledge, anterior segment changes have not been described previously in idiopathic Raynaud's disease. 
Hypopharyngeal lipoma as a cause for sudden asphyxial death. Lipomas of the hypopharynx are uncommon tumors that are rarely life threatening. When positioned in the hypopharynx, asphyxia may be the result of the tumor size or sudden displacement into the oropharynx. We present a case of a large hypopharyngeal lipoma, review the literature, and discuss mechanisms by which these lesions may cause sudden asphyxial death. 
Systematic underreporting of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts. Possible implications for national incidence figures. An independent tabulation of incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts indicates that 12% and perhaps as many as 19% of new cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts are not recorded in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry, significantly more than the expected 5% (p = 0.0001). The increasing number of nonhospital medical settings in which melanomas can be diagnosed and/or treated appears to account for this discrepancy. We suspect that these findings in Massachusetts also apply to cancer reporting systems in other regions of the United States. We suggest that the true incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts, and perhaps in the United States, may be significantly higher than reported. 
Local anesthesia blocks the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture. The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia. Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes at the time of administration of premedication. In random order the site of the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients. Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline solution. This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia. 
The gastropulmonary route of infection--fact or fiction? Published studies relating to whether medicinal stress-bleeding prophylaxis leading to an increase of gastric pH favors the development of bronchopulmonary infections are reviewed. Results from studies in healthy humans, patients with ulcer disease, and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) clearly show that the risk of gastric bacterial colonization significantly increases relative to increasing gastric pH. Moreover, a drug-induced increase of gastric pH leads directly to gastric bacterial colonization also in patients in the ICU, above all with bacteria typical of the gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the different bacterial spectra of the oropharynx, stomach, and upper small intestine, it becomes clear that the stomach is a reservoir of bacteria independent of the oropharynx and also subject to retrograde colonization due to the duodenogastric reflux. Both by means of microbiological and in particular direct detection procedures, it can be demonstrated that in at least 30-40% of intubated patients a gastropulmonary route of colonization occurs. In patient groups without a medication-induced increase of gastric pH the number of bacteria detected in the tracheal secretion is about 33% less than in the case of conventional stress-bleeding prophylaxis. These findings make it understandable that a highly significant increase in the pneumonia rate is seen in patients receiving pH-increasing stress-bleeding prophylaxis versus control groups without therapy essentially influencing gastric pH. A risk score was developed that allows an easy description of those patients who are at an increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the gastropulmonary route of colonization. 
Improved mammographic accuracy. Use of ancillary imaging studies to evaluate suspicious screening mammograms can improve their positive predictive value for detecting malignant lesions. In 1989 8181 screening mammograms were performed at the breast evaluation center at Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Long Beach. A total of 670 patients were called back for magnification views or ultrasonographic evaluation, and 92 of these patients underwent surgical biopsy. There were 42 cancers diagnosed, yielding an accuracy rate of 46%. 
Complications of diverticular disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a prospective study. Previous retrospective studies have suggested an association between consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the complications of diverticular disease. Ninety-two patients were entered into a prospective study of the complications of diverticular disease over a 3 year period; 31 were taking NSAIDs, compared with only four age- and sex-matched controls from a representative general practice (P less than 0.001). A second control group comprised 306 patients with cancer of the colon in whom NSAID consumption was again significantly lower than in patients with diverticular disease (22 of 306 versus 31 of 92, P less than 0.001). Of the 31 patients taking NSAIDs, 19 presented with a perforation or peritonitis. By contrast, only eight of the 61 patients not taking NSAIDs had such complications (P less than 0.001). Eleven patients presented with bleeding of whom five were taking NSAIDs and six were not. Patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease have a high incidence of NSAID intake, and it appears that NSAID consumption is associated with a more severe form of the disease. 
Heparin, deep venous thrombosis, and trauma patients. One hundred consecutive patients with multiple trauma, who were admitted to a level I trauma center with an injury severity score of 10 or greater, were studied prospectively. A duplex scan was used to evaluate each patient initially and at set intervals during the hospitalization for the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The prophylactic regimen for DVT in this study was 5,000 U of subcutaneous heparin every 12 hours. This was used in 50 patients at the discretion of the attending physician, while the remaining 50 patients received no DVT prophylaxis. Fourteen of 50 patients (28%) who were receiving heparin developed DVT, while only 1 patient (2%) of the 50 who did not receive heparin developed DVT. The use of heparin did not provide any significant protection in the susceptible trauma patient. It is believed that those patients with minimal lower extremity injuries, lower injury severity scores, and a shorter period of immobilization do not require any form of DVT prophylaxis. However, those patients at increased risk for DVT are better served with either increased doses of heparin or alternative forms of DVT prophylaxis.
