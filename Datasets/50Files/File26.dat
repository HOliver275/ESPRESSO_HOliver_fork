5	Scoliosis in trisomy 18. Patients with trisomy 18 typically present with multiple congenital anomalies and most die within the first year. However, long-term survivors are not uncommon. Seventeen patients with trisomy 18 were evaluated to study the development of scoliosis associated with this disorder. There were 13 females and 4 males with ages ranging from birth to 22 years. Twelve patients died by age 2. None developed scoliosis or had vertebral anomalies. The five patients who survived beyond age 2 developed scoliosis. Curve progression was demonstrated in the patients who returned for follow-up. Bracing was not well tolerated in two patients with curves of 48 degrees and 58 degrees. Both had poor motor control and sitting ability. One patient with a 30 degree curve was successfully managed by bracing. Another patient with a severe scoliosis was successfully fused with anterior and posterior instrumentation. Patients with trisomy 18 should be carefully evaluated for scoliosis. Scoliosis in the older child, surviving beyond age 2, may be progressive and difficult to manage. 
5	Single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction. The mainstay for repairing subglottic and tracheal stenosis has been the rib graft with prolonged stenting. A refinement of this treatment was the use of the anterior cricoid decompression (split). We present single-stage reconstruction of the airway as an additional refinement of the laryngotracheoplasty. This article describes the experience of two institutions with single-stage reconstruction and offers some observations on the principles of the technique. 
4	Giant-cell arteritis of the uterus with associated temporal arteritis: a case report. Giant-cell arteritis involving the uterus was identified incidentally upon hysterectomy and anterior colporrhaphy for uterine prolapse. Subsequently, the patient was found to have giant-cell temporal arteritis presenting with fever of unknown origin. Fourteen previous cases involving the female genital tract have been reported. There appears to be an association between constitutional symptoms of fever, weight loss, malaise, headache, and polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly women with uterine prolapse and giant-cell arteritis of the genital tract. The rare presentation of giant-cell arteritis in the female genital tract does not support invasive costly evaluation in asymptomatic patients. However, a thorough investigation for involvement of other sites, including appropriate treatment for generalized disease, should be undertaken. 
4	The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in elderly patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. Determinants and risks associated with serum uric acid were investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or placebo. Pretreatment serum uric acid levels were significantly higher in men than in women and had positive correlation with serum creatinine. After adjustment for serum creatinine, positive correlations of serum uric acid with body weight and fasting blood glucose in women and with serum cholesterol in men were significant. During follow-up, serum uric acid increased significantly in the treated patients, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality were unrelated to initial serum uric acid levels. One placebo patient and seven treated patients developed gout. Of those seven, most were male patients and had significantly higher serum levels of uric acid and creatinine than the other patients. Gender and renal function were the major determinants of serum uric acid in elderly hypertensive patients. 
1	Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 10 mm are rare. Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter associated with subserosal extension through a "locus minoris resistentiae" and metastases to lymph nodes, an association not previously reported. No residual adenomatous tissue was found, suggesting a de novo carcinoma. 
5	Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Posterior 360 degrees retinotomy in conjunction with extensive peripheral retinectomy was necessary for retinal reattachment in 18 eyes. A visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 22% of the patients; in patients with rubeosis, regression was found in 89%. Of the hypotonus eyes, preoperatively 78% were normotensive postoperatively after removal of anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) covering ciliary epithelium. The major intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, which could be readily controlled. Recurrent retinal detachment (RD) occurred in 39% and reproliferation in 50% of the patients. 
3	Early diagnosis and survival of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. The hospital records of patients treated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a recent 5-year period were reviewed to collect data on factors which may be associated with mortality. Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy. 
4	Embolization with particles in thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations: long-term angiographic and clinical results. To evaluate the long-term results of endovascular treatment with particles in the management of thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical findings in 35 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs. 
4	Quadricuspid aortic valve and aortic regurgitation diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of patients with quadricuspid aortic valve diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography are presented. Aortic regurgitation was detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in both patients. Because they were young patients, this aortic regurgitation indicated that aortic regurgitation is not necessarily a late-developing event, as has been thought previously. 
1	Mammographic measurements before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Thirty-five augmented women underwent mammography using both the standard implant-compression technique and, when possible, the implant-displacement technique; all had preaugmentation film-screen mammography available for evaluation. The area of mammographically visualized breast tissue before and after augmentation mammaplasty was measured using a transparent grid. Patients with subglandular implants had a mean decrease of 49 percent of measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 39 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Patients with submuscular implants had a 28 percent decrease in measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 9 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Anterior breast tissue was seen better with displacement mammography; posterior breast tissue, with compression mammography. Most patients had some degree of parenchymal scarring and lower image quality after augmentation. State-of-the-art mammography was not possible in most patients augmented with silicone-gel-filled implants. 
1	Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates for the prevention of refractoriness and primary HLA alloimmunization: a prospective, randomized trial. Compared with conventional transfusion regimes a strong reduction in HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions is obtained when both red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) are depleted of leukocytes by filtration. Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration. 
2	Complications of Tenckhoff catheters post removal. Complications due to Tenckhoff catheters can occur at prolonged intervals after their removal. From January 1979 to October 1989, 431 patients at our center began continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 278 of whom subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement therapy. We identified 12 patients (4.3% or 12/278) with post removal catheter complications. There were 14 post removal complications, two each in two patients, and one in each of 12 others. The mean time to complication was 541 +/- 143 days (27-2,040). In 71% (10/14) of the complications, an abscess was found at the site of the previously removed Tenckhoff catheter. In 29% (4/14) of the complications, foreign body material consistent with a retained cuff was recovered. Documentation at the time of Tenckhoff catheter removal should include a statement regarding the presence of the Tenckhoff catheter cuffs, and patients with retained cuffs should be monitored closely for the development of abscesses or other complications. Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for these complications. 
3	Fatal or severely disabling cerebral infarction during hospitalization for stroke or transient ischemic attack. Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day. These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion. Only one patient survived. Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy. Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued. No coagulation abnormalities were documented. We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients. 

Excision of limbal dermoids. We reviewed the clinical files of 10 patients who had undergone excision of unilateral epibulbar limbal dermoids. Preoperatively, all of the affected eyes had worse visual acuity (P less than .02) and more astigmatism (P less than .01) than the contralateral eyes. Postoperatively, every patient was cosmetically improved. Of the eight patients for whom both preoperative and postoperative visual acuity measurements had been obtained, in six it had changed minimally (less than or equal to 1 line), and in two it had improved (less than or equal to 2 lines). Surgical complications included persistent epithelial defects (40%) and peripheral corneal vascularization and opacity (70%). These complications do not outweigh the cosmetic and visual benefits of dermoid excision in selected patients. 
Bell's palsy. A diagnosis of exclusion. In cases of acute unilateral facial weakness, a careful and systematic evaluation is necessary to identify the cause. Idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is also the most common cause of unilateral facial weakness seen by primary care physicians. The most important aspect of initial treatment is eye protection. Administration of systemic oral corticosteroids may lessen severity and duration of symptoms. 
Retained endobronchial foreign body removal facilitated by steroid therapy of an obstructing, inflammatory polyp. Oral and topical steroids were used to induce regression in an inflammatory, obstructing endobronchial polyp caused by a retained foreign body. The FB (a peanut half), which had been present for over six months, was then able to be easily and bloodlessly retrieved with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. 
Recurrent buccal space abscesses: a complication of Crohn's disease. A patient is described with generalized gastrointestinal involvement by Crohn's disease. Symptoms of recurrent ulceration and mucosal tags are well-described oral manifestations of Crohn's disease; however, in our patient recurrent facial abscesses, which required extraoral drainage, also developed. This complication has not previously been reported. 
Intracranial fibromatosis. Fibromatoses are uncommon infiltrative lesions affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often of the limbs and trunk. Lesions involving the cranial cavity are rare and require the same aggressive surgical management as elsewhere in the body. This case illustrates their clinical and neuroradiological features and underscores the necessity for aggressive resection to avoid recurrence. The literature is reviewed. 
The effect of intrathecal morphine on somatosensory evoked potentials in awake humans. Although the effect of systemic opioids on somatosensory evoked potentials has been well described, little is known about the interaction between intrathecally administered opioid analgesics and somatosensory evoked potentials. Accordingly, the influence of intrathecally administered morphine on posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTSCEPs) was investigated in 22 unpremedicated, awake, neurologically normal patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal or pelvic procedures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either preservation-free intrathecal morphine sulfate (ITMS) or placebo. After baseline PTSCEP, heart rate and, mean blood pressure were recorded, ITMS (15 micrograms.kg-1) was injected via standard dural puncture with the patient in the lateral position. PTSCEPs, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were recorded again at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Control patients were treated identically (including position, sterile preparation, and subcutaneous tissue infiltration with local anesthetic), except for lumbar puncture, and were unaware of their randomization. Before administration of ITMS, PTSCEP P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 latencies were 39.4 +/- 3.2, 47.6 +/- 3.9, 59.2 +/- 3.2, 70.4 +/- 3.7, and 84.6 +/- 5.5 ms, (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. The corresponding P1-N1, N1-P2, and P2-N2 amplitudes were 2.4 +/- 1.1, 2.4 +/- 1.1, and 2.3 +/- 0.9 microV, respectively. There were no significant changes over time between the control and ITMS groups. PTSCEPs resulting from left-sided stimulation were not different from those elicited by right-sided stimulation. All ITMS patients had intense postoperative analgesia for at least 24 h. It is concluded that ITMS does not affect PTSCEP waveforms in the 35-90 ms latency range during the awake state. 
The 29th Rovenstine lecture: clinical challenges for the anesthesiologist. In conclusion, I hope that my comments have reaffirmed your biases or, even more importantly, stimulated you to think in a different way about the information explosion in our specialty and medicine in general. I believe our specialty is in a golden era that will benefit from the past and be nourished by new discoveries and understanding. We as clinicians must accept the challenge of recognizing what new information deserves incorporation into our practice, what old information deserves to be sustained, and what merits new scrutiny and perhaps should be discarded. If I had one wish, it would be that anesthesiologists would never lose their zeal to be students--their thirst for new information--as the continuum of anesthesia education is indeed a life-long process. That wish, ladies and gentlemen, is my challenge to all anesthesiologists. 
Mortality in patients treated with flecainide and encainide for supraventricular arrhythmias. In a recent clinical trial, the class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs encainide and flecainide were found to be associated with an increased mortality risk in patients with new myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of this study was to assess whether an increased mortality risk also accompanied the use of these drugs to treat patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Data were obtained from the respective pharmaceutical sponsors on the mortality observed with each drug in United States and foreign protocols enrolling patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Mortality in the encainide population (343 patients) and the flecainide population (236 patients) was compared with that in a research arrhythmia clinic, the Duke population (154 patients). Nine deaths occurred in the combined encainide-flecainide population and 10 deaths occurred in the Duke population; the follow-up periods averaged 488 days and 1,285 days, respectively. The 6-year survival functions of these 2 populations, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier technique, did not differ significantly (p = 0.62). The hazard ratio for the combined encainide-flecainide population relative to the Duke population was estimated to be 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.2, 1.7. These descriptive comparisons did not demonstrate any excess mortality when flecainide and encainide were used in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 
Approaches to immunotherapy of cancer: characterization of lymphokines as second signals for cytotoxic T-cell generation. Lymphokines, the soluble molecules produced by cells of the immune system, regulate cell-cell interactions and, consequently, the functional status of the immune system. Altering immunoregulatory pathways with lymphokines in vivo may provide a mechanism for controlling a variety of immunologic disorders. Although normally produced in vivo in very small quantities, the widespread availability of recombinant lymphokines has made it possible to study the molecular signals involved in production of lymphocyte effectors with activity against tumor. For example, interleukin-2-based cancer immunotherapy programs have, in certain clinical situations, suggested that immunologic intervention can influence the regression of metastatic cancer. Ultimately the successful application of these biologic agents requires an understanding of the interaction between the immune system and tumor on a molecular level. To induce a given biologic effect, it is necessary both to classify the required lymphokines and to identify the relevant effector cell populations. This review will examine the progress made in identifying the requirements for lymphokine-induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function. 
Retinal artery obstruction and atheromas associated with non-Hodgkin's large cell lymphoma (reticulum cell sarcoma). A 71-year-old woman developed branch retinal artery obstruction as the presenting manifestation of a large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multifocal chorioretinal scars were present in the same eye. She experienced progressive visual loss accompanied by development of multiple yellow retinal arterial wall plaques, extension of retinal opacification into other quadrants, and increasing vitreous cellular infiltration. Clinical diagnoses included branch retinal arterial obstruction caused by toxoplasmosis retinitis, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis simulating the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, vitiliginous chorioretinitis, and the acute retinal necrosis syndrome. Four months after onset, the right eye was blind and was enucleated. Histopathologic examination revealed extensive lymphomatous infiltration and necrosis of the retina and optic nerve. The retinal arteries were partly obstructed by lymphomatous infiltration and atheromas. Subsequently, the left eye and central nervous system were involved by lymphoma. 
The 'tonic' pain-related behaviour seen in mononeuropathic rats is modulated by morphine and naloxone. This study investigated the sensitivity to pharmacological manipulations of a rating method, adapted from the formalin test, to measure the tonic component of the pain-related behaviour induced by creating a peripheral mononeuropathy with 4 loose ligatures around the common sciatic nerve. Although the adequacy of opioid substances in alleviating neuropathic pain is highly controversial, the effects of morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) and naloxone (1 mg/and 3 micrograms/kg i.v.) were tested 1-2 weeks after the nerve ligatures were established, when pain-related behaviours were well developed. Morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) induced a potent and prolonged decrease in the pain-rating score at week 2 after surgery. Either at week 1 or week 2, naloxone elicited a bidirectional dose-dependent action: a further increase in the pain-rating score with the high dose (1 mg/kg i.v.), and a paradoxical decrease in the score with the low dose of 3 micrograms/kg i.v. These effects are comparable to those already described in several rat models of inflammatory pain and, in the same model of neuropathy, using a phasic nociceptive test, the measure of the vocalization to paw pressure. A few differences in the effects of naloxone on tonic and phasic pain are noted and discussed. 
Examination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. 
Hepatic transmethylation and blood alcohol levels. Golden Syrian hamsters that have elevated hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity were divided into four groups and group-fed on four different liquid diets for five weeks. Group I was fed a control diet formulated for hamsters. Group II was fed the control diet containing 20 micrograms of 4 methylpyrazole per litre. Group III was fed the hamster ethanol liquid diet (ethanol amounting to 36% of total calories). Group IV was fed the ethanol diet to which 4-methylpyrazole (20 micrograms/litre) was added. Groups I, II and III were group-fed the amount consumed by Group IV on a daily basis. Upon killing the animals, blood alcohol levels were found to be elevated in Group IV but not in Group III. Hepatic methionine synthetase (MS) was inhibited in Group IV. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase was induced in this group to compensate for the MS inhibition and liver betaine was lowered reflecting this induction. None of these changes were seen in Group III. Since none of the animals showed an aversion to their respective diets and gained weight normally, these data indicate that it was the elevated blood levels of ethanol rather than nutritional factors that were related to the changes in methionine metabolism. 
Memory T cells represent the predominant lymphocyte subset in acute and chronic liver inflammation. T cells can be divided into two main phenotypic subpopulations-i.e., the CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) "naive" subset and the CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) "memory" subset. In light of this recent functional reinterpretation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, we reinvestigated the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsy specimens from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. In normal liver, the few scattered mononuclear cells present in portal tracts and in the intralobular parenchyma consisted of both CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) naive and CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells. In inflammatory liver diseases, portal tract and periportal and intralobular areas of inflammation consisted virtually only of CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells, which strongly expressed the CDw29 (4B4) antigen, and the adhesion molecules LFA-1, CD2, LFA-3, CD44 and VLA-4 and the activation marker human leukocyte antigen-DR. These results indicate that activated memory T cells represent the predominant subpopulation of lymphocytes in areas of liver inflammation. Memory T cells strongly express various homing receptors and adhesion molecules, which probably allow them to accumulate at inflammatory sites and to strengthen interaction with target cells. Furthermore, the increased number of memory T cells with enhanced interferon-gamma production in areas of liver inflammation may contribute to the maintenance and up-regulation of immune responses occurring in inflammatory liver diseases. 
Inflammatory properties of neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8) in human skin: a light- and electronmicroscopic study. Neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), purified to homogeneity from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes, was injected intracutaneously into human skin. Sequential biopsy specimens were taken in order to investigate the sequence of ultrastructural changes induced by the cytokine. Whereas intracutaneous injection of 100 ng of NAP-1/IL-8 per site caused no macroscopic changes, by histology infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes was present within 1 h and increased at 3 and 5 h. No lymphocyte infiltration was noted. The first ultrastructural changes (30 min) consisted of the presence of cytoplasmic 7-nm microfilament bundles, as well as numerous protrusions of the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells (EC). As a striking feature, multiple 100- to 160-nm electron lucent vesicles could be observed in the EC cytoplasm. These structures differed from plasmalemmal vesicles and suggest secretory activity. When PMN and monocytes appeared in the vascular lumen (1 h and later), the number of 100-160-nm electron-lucent vesicles had decreased significantly. In contrast to C5a-injected skin sites, mast cell degranulation was absent. 
Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion. Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall involvement continues to present a major clinical challenge. We have treated 52 patients since 1973, excluding those with superior sulcus tumors. There were 37 male and 15 female patients with an average age of 62.9 years. Chest pain was an initial symptom in 37%. All patients had negative mediastinoscopy results. Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 53% and adenocarcinoma in 35%. The median number of ribs resected was two (range, one to six), and only 2 patients required chest wall reconstruction. Pathologic staging was T3 N0 M0 in 83% and T3 N1 M0 in 17%. Operative mortality was 3.8%. Absolute 5-year survival was 26.3%. Patients who had N1 disease had a 5-year survival of only 11%. Radiation therapy was employed in 46% for positive nodes or close margins. Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion remains potentially curable if N2 nodes are not involved. The role of radiation therapy has not been clearly defined. Morbidity and mortality should be minimal. 
Electronic weaponry--a question of safety [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Sep;20(9):1031] Electronic weapons represent a new class of weapon available to law enforcement and the lay public. Although these weapons have been available for several years, there is inadequate research to document their safety or efficacy. Two of the most common, the TASER and the stun gun, are reviewed. The electronic weapon was initially and still is approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission; its approval was based on theoretical calculations of the physical effects of damped sinusoidal pulses, not on the basis of animal or human studies. These devices are widely available and heavily promoted, despite limited research into their safety or efficiency and despite recent animal studies documenting their potential for lethality. 
Operative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. 
Torsades de pointes occurring in association with terfenadine use. Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that is associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Although found in many clinical settings, torsades de pointes is most often drug induced. This report describes the first association (exclusive of drug overdose) of symptomatic torsades de pointes occurring with the use of terfenadine in a patient who was taking the recommended prescribed dose of this drug in addition to cefaclor, ketoconazole, and medroxyprogesterone. Measured serum concentrations of terfenadine and its main metabolite showed excessive levels of parent terfenadine and proportionately reduced concentrations of metabolite, suggesting inhibition of terfenadine metabolism. We believe that a drug interaction between terfenadine and ketoconazole resulted in the elevated terfenadine levels in plasma and in the cardiotoxicity previously seen only in cases of terfenadine overdose. 
Asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses are more prevalent among patients with unsuspected renal artery stenoses. The prevalence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis among patients with peripheral vascular disease has been reported to be as high as 40%, but the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses in these patients is not known. The biplane aortograms of 205 male patients who were military veterans and had aneurysms or occlusive disease were independently reviewed, and medical records were studied to determine associated coronary disease, risk factors, and patient outcome. Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients. 
Brain-stem auditory evoked responses in 56 patients with acoustic neurinoma. The brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's) recorded from 56 patients with acoustic neurinomas were analyzed. Ten of the patients had intracanalicular tumors and 46 had extracanalicular tumors. It was possible to obtain BAER's following stimulation of the affected side in 28 patients and after stimulation of the unaffected side in all 56. Five patients (11%) had normal BAER's following stimulation of both sides; three of these patients had intracanalicular tumors. Among BAER's obtained following stimulation of the affected ear, the mean interpeak latency (IPL) for peaks I to III associated with extracanalicular tumors was significantly prolonged relative to controls (p less than 0.001), and linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between tumor size and IPL of peaks I to III (p less than 0.05). Analysis of the 56 BAER's recorded after stimulation of the unaffected side revealed a significant positive correlation between the IPL's of peaks III to V and tumor size (p less than 0.001). This correlation was not strengthened when accounting for the degree of brain-stem compression. Finally, evidence of preserved function within the auditory pathway, even in the presence of partial hearing loss, is presented. This finding suggests that more patients might benefit from surgical procedures that spare the eighth cranial nerve. 
First heterotransplantation of a human carcinoid tumor into nude mice. The first successful heterotransplantation of a human carcinoid tumor into nude mice is reported. CSH, a voluminous hepatic metastasis of a primary bronchial carcinoid tumor (CSB) was resected and transplanted into three irradiated nude (Swiss-nu/nu) mice both by subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) routes; the success rate was five of six. Heterotransplanted tumors took 4 to 5 months to appear in the mice and 1 month to attain a width of 0.5 cm. Both human and mouse tumors (named CSH-SC and CSH-IM) were studied by light and electron microscopy. They were Grimelius-positive, neuron-specific enolase-positive, and bombesin-negative by immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, CSH-SC cells presented characteristic (pear-shaped, rod-shaped, or tadpole-shaped) neurosecretory granules. Although CSB and CSH were slightly serotonin positive by immunocytochemistry, only a few serotonin-positive cells were found in CSH-SC and none in CSH-IM, suggesting partial loss of differentiation or an increase in serotonin catabolism during transplantation. 
A prospective evaluation of the immediate reproducibility of the signal-averaged ECG. The purpose of this investigation was to prospectively evaluate the immediate reproducibility of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG). A total of 114 patients undergoing evaluation for ventricular arrhythmias were enrolled in this protocol. Two consecutive SAECG's (40 Hz bidirectional high-pass filtering with a computer-automated system) were performed 10 minutes apart. Abnormal SAECG parameters were defined as (1) vector QRS duration more than 120 msec, (2) terminal root mean square (RMS) voltage less than 20 microV, and (3) low-amplitude signal (LAS) duration more than 40 msec. An SAECG was defined as abnormal if at least one vector parameter was abnormal. There was close correlation between vector parameters during the two SAECG observations: QRS duration had the highest reproducibility (r2 = 0.97, p less than 0.001) followed by terminal RMS voltage (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.001), and LAS duration (r2 = 0.90, p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) percentage of change between the two recordings was 2% +/- 2% of the QRS duration, 13% +/- 22% for terminal RMS voltage, and 7% +/- 11% for LAS duration. The reproducibility of an initially normal SAECG was 92% and of an initially abnormal SAECG, 96%. Seventeen patients (15%) had a change in one of the three vector parameters between the two recordings. There were no clinically significant differences between the 17 patients in whom the SAECG was nonreproducible and the 97 patients in whom the SAECG was reproducible. However, reproducibility was significantly higher in patients with an initially normal versus an initially abnormal SAECG (92% vs 76%, p = 0.03). 
Hypertension, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein A-I as risk factors for stroke in the Chinese. We analyzed the serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins and the prevalence of other risk factors in a case-control study of 304 consecutive Chinese patients with acute stroke (classified as cerebral infarction, lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage) and 304 age- and sex-matched controls. For all strokes we identified the following risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; the presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular hypertrophy; a glycosylated hemoglobin A1 concentration of greater than 9.1%; a fasting plasma glucose concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 6.0 mmol/l; a serum triglyceride concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 2.1 mmol/l; and a serum lipoprotein(a) concentration of greater than 29.2 mg/dl. We found the following protective factors: a serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration of greater than 1.59 mmol/l and a serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mg/dl. The patterns of risk factors differed among the three stroke subtypes. When significant risk factors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model, we found a history of hypertension, a high serum lipoprotein(a) concentration, and a low apolipoprotein A-I concentration to be independent risk factors for all strokes. The attributable risk for hypertension was estimated to be 24% in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years. In this population, in which cerebrovascular diseases are the third commonest cause of mortality, identification of risk factors will allow further studies in risk factor modification for the prevention of stroke. 
Prevalence of air bronchograms in small peripheral carcinomas of the lung on thin-section CT: comparison with benign tumors. Despite improved techniques--such as bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle biopsy--to evaluate pulmonary nodules, there are still many cases in which surgical resection is necessary before carcinoma can be differentiated from benign lesions. The present study was undertaken to determine if the presence of an air bronchogram or air bronchiologram (patent visible bronchus or bronchiole) is useful in distinguishing small lung cancers from benign nodules. Thin-section chest CT scans were obtained in patients with 20 peripheral lung cancers less than 2 cm in diameter (18 adenocarcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one large cell carcinoma) and 20 small benign nodules (eight hamartomas, seven tuberculomas, two foci of aspergillosis, one focus of cryptococcosis, one chronic focal interstitial pneumonitis, and one plasma cell granuloma). The images were compared with regard to the patency of any bronchus or bronchiole within the lesions. After surgical resection, the specimens were inflated with agar and sectioned transversely to correlate gross morphology and low-power histologic sections with the CT appearance. An air bronchogram or air bronchiologram was seen in the tumors on 65% of CT scans and 70% of histologic sections. Benign nodules had a patent bronchus or bronchiole on CT scans and histologic sections in only one case (5%). These findings suggest that the presence of an air bronchogram in a lung nodule is a useful finding to help differentiate adenocarcinomas from benign lesions. 
Long-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). 
Real-time ultrasound for the detection of deep venous thrombosis. PURPOSE: Accurate diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a clinical problem in emergency practice. A prospective trial was conducted comparing real-time ultrasound with contrast venography in the diagnosis of proximal DVT. METHODS: Seventy patients whose clinical presentations mandated diagnostic evaluation for DVT had real-time ultrasound of the involved leg followed by contrast venography. Initial readings of ultrasound and venography were compared with each other and with final readings to assess reliability of interpretation. RESULTS: Final ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in all patients. Negative initial ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in 56 of 56 patients (negative predictive value, 100%; 95% confidence interval, 94 to 100). Eighteen patients had positive initial ultrasound readings compared with 14 who had positive final venogram readings (positive predictive value, 78%; 95% confidence interval, 55 to 91). CONCLUSION: Negative real-time ultrasonography reliably excludes proximal DVT. Positive ultrasound reliably diagnoses proximal DVT only in experienced hands. 
Single- versus dual-chamber sensor-driven pacing: comparison of cardiac outputs. Previous studies have shown that single-chamber sensor-driven pacing improves exercise tolerance for patients with chronotropic incompetence. However, long-term single-chamber pacing has a number of inherent problems that limit its usefulness. Although sensor-driven dual-chamber pacing largely obviates the problems inherent with single-chamber sensor-driven pacing, the physiologic benefit of dual-chamber sensor-driven pacing has not yet been demonstrated. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise-induced cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence, after programming their pacemakers to either a simulated sensor-driven single or simulated dual-chamber mode. Cardiac output was measured noninvasively at rest and peak exercise using standard Doppler-derived measurements, obtained in a blinded fashion. At rest the Doppler-derived resting VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 4.49 +/- 0.3 L/min and 4.68 +/- 0.3 L/min, respectively. At peak exercise, the DDD cardiac output was 5.07 +/- 0.5 L/min, whereas the simulated activity VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 6.33 +/- 0.6 L/min and 7.41 +/- 0.70 L/min, respectively. Analysis of variance showed that there was an overall significant difference in cardiac output from rest to peak exercise (p less than 0.001). However, only the simulated activity DDD cardiac output was significantly different from its respective control value (p less than 0.05). Thus this study shows for the first time that the addition of rate responsiveness to dual-chamber pacing results in a significant improvement in cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence. 
FDP D-dimer induces the secretion of interleukin-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 in a human promonocytic leukemia cell line. We studied the effect of fibrinogen degradation products D, E, and D-dimer on a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, NOMO-1. After exposure to a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D or D-dimer, the cells displayed macrophage-like characteristics, such as adherence to plastic surfaces, and showed approximately a twofold increase in response to the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. The secretion of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) into the medium was markedly stimulated by a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D, E, and D-dimer, whereas a significant increase in IL-1 beta secretion was observed only in D-dimer-stimulated cells. In addition, D-dimer induced a rapid increase in urokinase-type plasminogen activator on day 1 (0.52 +/- 0.02 ng/mL v 0.07 +/- 0.01 ng/mL in the control culture) and a slow increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 on day 5 (3.9 +/- 1.6 ng/mL v 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/mL in the control culture). An increase in tissue factor (TF) was also demonstrated on the cell surface of NOMO-1 cells exposed to fragment D or D-dimer by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-TF monoclonal antibody. Scatchard plot analysis showed that fragment D and D-dimer bound to the NOMO-1 cells with a kd of 3.3 nmol/L and 2.7 nmol/L, respectively. These results suggest that fragment D-dimer specifically stimulates cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage to secrete key substances that regulate blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation. 
Stereotactic management of colloid cysts: factors predicting success. Stereotactic aspiration is a valuable surgical alternative for colloid cysts when used alone or in conjunction with microsurgical resection. Since 1981, the authors have performed computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic aspiration as the initial procedure in 22 patients with colloid cysts; stereotactic aspiration alone was successful in 11 patients (50%). Of the 11 patients in whom aspiration failed, stereotactic endoscopic resection was attempted in three and was successful in one. Seven patients required a craniotomy and microsurgical removal of the cyst performed via a transcortical approach. The preoperative CT appearance in eight cases of a hypodense or isodense cyst correlated favorably with successful aspiration of the cyst in six patients. A hyperdense appearance on the preoperative CT scan in 14 cases was associated with subtotal aspiration in 13 patients; five required craniotomy for removal. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in eight patients provided excellent anatomical definition of the cyst and its relationship to other structures of the third ventricle, but it was not possible to correlate successful aspiration with cyst appearance on MR images with short or long relaxation time sequences. The authors' 9-year experience suggests that preoperative CT studies accurately determine size, predict viscosity, and help to define a group of colloid cyst patients for whom stereotactic cyst aspiration will likely be successful. Unsuccessful stereotactic aspiration was related to two features: the high viscosity of the intracystic colloid material (nine patients), or deviation of the cyst away from the aspiration needle due to small cyst volume (two patients). Because of its simplicity and low risk, stereotactic surgery can be offered to selected patients as the initial procedure of choice. Craniotomy can be reserved for those whose imaging studies predict failure or for those whose cyst cannot be aspirated. 
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging in chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy. Twenty one patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and five patients with chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with benign monoclonal paraproteinaemia none of whom had signs or symptoms of central nervous system disease, had cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 1.5 Tesla unit. Areas of increased white matter signal intensity were seen in one of 10 patients aged less than 50 years and in five of 16 patients aged more than 50 years. In only two of the patients (8%), neither of whom had paraproteinaemia, did the appearance strongly suggest demyelination. The only clinical variable that predicted MRI changes was age (p less than 0.01). 
Bleeding patterns during continuous combined estrogen-progestogen therapy. Bleeding and climacteric symptoms were recorded in two groups of postmenopausal women receiving either continuous combined estradiol and norethisterone acetate or estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Out of a sample of 99 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 54 years, 86 completed a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Comparison of the bleeding patterns in the two groups revealed a statistically significant difference: More women in the estradiol-cyproterone acetate group experienced bleeding and for a longer duration. Thirteen women in the estradiol-norethisterone acetate group were amenorrheic, compared with two in the other group. The Kupperman index score in both groups declined to about 30% to 40% of initial values (p less than 0.001). The hot flushes in both treatment groups decreased to a highly significant degree (p less than 0.001), to a value below 20% of baseline values. We conclude that a continuous combination of estrogen and progestogen can produce amenorrhea and symptomatic relief. However, the progestogen components seem to differ in their ability to control bleeding. 
Impaired hepatic handling and processing of lysophosphatidylcholine in rats with liver cirrhosis. Lysophosphatidylcholine is a major metabolic product in the plasma and cellular turnover of phospholipids, with well-known membrane-toxic and proinflammatory properties. Because the liver plays a key role in plasma lysophosphatidylcholine removal and biotransformation and because virtually nothing is known of these processes in a diseased organ, the hepatobiliary metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine was investigated in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis. Twelve adult male Wistar rats with histologically confirmed cirrhosis and 8 control animals were fitted with jugular and biliary catheters and allowed to recover. The animals were kept under constant IV infusion of taurocholate (1 mumol/min). Two microcuries of sn-1[14C]palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine was administered as a single bolus. The fate of the injected radioactivity, including removal from plasma, uptake, and subcellular location in the liver and molecular and aggregative forms, was studied by combined chromatographic and radiochemical methods. Major findings were (a) that lysophosphatidylcholine has a prolonged permanence in plasma of cirrhotic rats, due both to decreased hepatic clearance and to depressed conversion into phosphatidylcholine; (b) that the rate of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation is much slower in the cirrhotic than in the normal liver, both at the microsomal and at the cytosolic level; (c) that cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine in the cirrhotic liver, but not in the normal liver, is predominantly non-protein bound; (d) that the strict molecular selectivity of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation observed in controls is partially lost in cirrhosis; and (e) that a consistent fraction of lysophosphatidylcholine is converted into triacylglycerols in cirrhotics but not in controls. These findings show a profound derangment of lysophosphatidylcholine handling and processing in the cirrhotic liver, which is of potential pathogenetic significance. 
The value of single versus multiple sections for detection of lymph node metastasis. This study was undertaken to determine the value of serial sectioning of lymph nodes as an aid in optimally examining cervical specimens for metastasis. The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis in 802 lymph nodes obtained from 51 consecutive neck dissection specimens were initially determined by the routine method, examination of one section from each node. This examination revealed 40 lymph nodes with metastatic involvement. Further study of the 716 lymph nodes that were initially interpreted as free of tumor by serial sectioning added only two positive nodes. Thus, serial sectioning did not contribute significantly to the detection of lymph node metastasis. 
Cytotoxic activity in plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study evaluates an assay of cytotoxic effect of plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Plasma from 20 recently diagnosed ALS patients induced hemolysis of normal red blood cells with a significantly greater intensity than that of normal controls. After at least 1 month of treatment with prednisone and azathioprine, the hemolytic activity of ALS plasma was reduced but was still higher than that of control plasma. 
Multiple giant cell tumors and Paget disease of bone: radiographic and clinical correlations. The clinical and radiographic findings of four patients with multicentric giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone and Paget disease were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation; all patients underwent computed tomography (CT). The MR characteristics of the bone component in pagetic GCT appeared to reflect the pagetic phase; a sclerotic pattern was largely represented by hypointense marrow signal intensity on images obtained with both long and short repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs). Conversely, a tumor appearing in a mixed pagetic phase demonstrated more heterogeneous signal intensity with all pulse sequences. Extensive soft-tissue components, noted in all cases, showed largely intermediate signal intensity on short TR/TE images and foci of increased signal intensity on longer TR/TE images. In most cases, dramatic reduction in tumor bulk was noted with the use of steroids alone. An awareness of this entity is important because the appearance of lytic lesions with soft-tissue extension in patients with Paget disease does not necessarily imply a grave prognosis. Serial CT or MR imaging is helpful in monitoring the remissions and exacerbations that reflect response to therapy in Paget disease and GCT. 
Magnetic resonance assessment of the postoperative spine. Degenerative disc disease. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in patients after surgery for degenerative disc disease in the lumbar and cervical spine are discussed. In the lumbar spine, changes seen in the immediate postoperative period, use of Gd-DTPA in distinguishing scar and disc and postoperative complications are reviewed. In the cervical spine, operative approaches and types, the appearance of bony stenosis, and disc herniations are demonstrated. 
Urethroplasty using the pedicled island flap technique in complicated urethral strictures. Many techniques have been described for the repair of recurrent urethral strictures. Experience with 1-stage correction of hypospadias and epispadias, using a vascularized island flap technique, has led to its increased application for complicated adult urethral strictures. The advantage of the vascularized island flap technique is that reconstruction can be completed with only 1 operation, and it provides good subjective and objective results. Analysis of 50 consecutive cases treated by this approach has proved its validity. Of the 50 cases fistulas occurred in 20%, of which 12% required surgical correction, and stricture recurred in 32%. The largest proportion of recurrence was noted in patients who were primarily treated with 3 or more urethrotomies within a short time. Therefore, we recommend open surgical repair when 1 or 2 internal urethrotomies fail to produce a good result. 
Bullous pemphigoid autoantibodies, HIV-1 infection and pruritic papular eruption. Bullous pemphigoid (BP)-type autoantibodies were found by Western blot (WB) analysis of epidermal extracts in the serum of 38% of HIV-seropositive patients compared with 21% of HIV-seronegative patients with chronic pruritus and 76% of patients with BP. They were further identified as BP autoantibodies (BPab) by immunoprecipitation and immunoelectron microscopy. Their incidence increased from 21% in HIV infection stage II to 37% and 43% in stages III and IV, respectively. Of the patients suffering from HIV-related chronic pruritic papulovesicular eruption. 75% showed circulating BPab as compared with 29% in those without skin problems (P = 0.0066) and, among them, 30% met the diagnostic criteria for BP when histology, WB, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy techniques were used. In conclusion, this study identifies an autoimmune skin reaction that may account for, or be related to, the distressing pruritic eruptions occurring in HIV-infected patients. 
Molecular characterization of a region of DNA associated with mutations at the agouti locus in the mouse. Molecular characterization of a radiation-induced agouti (a)-locus mutation has resulted in the isolation of a segment of DNA that maps at or near the a locus on chromosome 2 in the mouse. This region of DNA is deleted in several radiation- or chemical-induced homozygous-lethal a-locus mutations and is associated with specific DNA structural alterations in two viable a-locus mutations. We propose that DNA probes from this region of chromosome 2 will be useful for ultimately characterizing the individual gene or genes associated with a-locus function. 
Fatty acids in human platelets and plasma. Fish oils decrease sensitivity toward N2 microbubbles. Platelet aggregation induced by N2 microbubbles (simulating microbubbles developed during deep diving) was measured in seven volunteers before and after intake of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (-EPA, 3.5 g/day) and ethyl-docosahexaenoate (-DHA, 2.5 g/day) for 2 wk. The relative content of arachidonic acid (AA) decreased in platelets from all individuals, whereas the content of EPA and DHA increased. The decrease of AA was almost identical with the increase of EPA plus DHA. In plasma the AA content was unchanged, while EPA and DHA increased. The N2 microbubble-induced aggregation showed a significant negative correlation with the DHA content both in platelets and in plasma. Less aggregation was also observed with high EPA content in platelets or plasma. A significant correlation between AA content in platelets and aggregation was seen. Intake of marine oils may be beneficial to divers under deep diving and to patients during extracorporeal circulation, because this may reduce the microbubble-induced aggregation. 
Midventricular obstruction associated with chronic systemic hypertension and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Midventricular obstruction is an uncommon finding previously defined by catheterization and angiographic techniques in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 10 consecutive patients (mean age 73 years) with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the unusual finding of a dynamic systolic obstruction located in the midportion of the left ventricle. All patients were known to have chronic hypertension, and none had a history or family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In each case, a well-defined, high velocity, turbulent jet was identified by Doppler color flow imaging and subsequently confirmed with conventional Doppler techniques. Septal and posterior wall thickness averaged 1.67 and 1.57 cm, respectively. Mean LV mass index was 199 g/m2 and ejection fraction averaged 78%. Peak systolic velocity obtained by continuous-wave Doppler averaged 2.7 m/s and appeared as either a "late-peaking" or a "spike and dome" configuration. Seven of 10 patients gave a history of syncope or severe presyncope at the time of echocardiographic examination. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, syncope or presyncope had resolved in 5 patients in whom medication was adjusted based on the ultrasound study, but persisted in 2 patients in whom diuretic therapy was continued. It is concluded that obstruction to systolic flow can occur at the mid-LV level in some patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy and avoidance of medication known to lower LV volume may relieve symptoms of transient inadequate cardiac output. 
The impact of nonidentical ABO cadaveric renal transplantation on waiting times and graft survival. Blood type O recipients of cadaveric renal transplants have longer pretransplant waiting periods than blood type A, B, and AB recipients. To evaluate reasons for and consequences of this discrepancy, we studied both the frequency of various donor and recipient blood type combinations and their outcomes. Among 37,659 cadaveric renal transplants performed during 1983 through 1989, there were 2,625 transplants (7%) received by patients of compatible but nonidentical blood types. Of 18,575 type O donor organs, 16,784 were received by type O patients for a recipient to donor ratio of 0.9. The corresponding ratios were greater than 1.0 for all other blood types (1.02 for blood type A, 1.14 for type B, and 2.18 for type AB). This causes blood type O patients to have a lower access to transplantation and to have significantly longer waiting times than patients of all other blood types. This inequality of access diminished significantly (P less than 0.001) over the years, but did not resolve by 1989. Analysis of relative risk for first graft loss by multiple regression (Cox) showed that transplantation across compatible blood types had a 9.1% higher risk (P less than 0.1) than that of transplantation among identical blood types. Cadaveric renal transplantation within identical blood types optimizes access to transplantation and avoids further aggravating past disadvantages for blood type O recipients. 
Results of a recently instituted programme of thrombolytic therapy in acute lower limb ischaemia. Twenty-eight patients with acute lower limb ischaemia received low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy over a 2-year period. Eighteen patients received streptokinase and ten patients received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA). Indications included arterial thromboemboli and graft failures. Mean ischaemic times were similar in both groups. Treatment time to achieve lysis was significantly less with rTPA (P less than 0.01). Subsequent vascular procedures, including angioplasty or reconstruction, were undertaken in 36 per cent of patients. Arterial puncture site bleeding occurred in eight (29 per cent) patients. Three (11 per cent) patients suffered rethrombosis after initial successful lysis. All rethromboses were successfully lysed with rTPA. There were two major amputations. Five (18 per cent) patients died, all lytic failures in the streptokinase treatment group. There were no cerebral haemorrhagic events and no patient died as a result of thrombolytic therapy. Good clinical outcome was obtained in nine of 18 patients treated with streptokinase and in nine of ten patients treated with rTPA. Intra-arterial thrombolysis provides effective therapy with high rates of limb salvage and a low mortality rate. This study suggests that rTPA may be a more effective agent, causing less morbidity, than streptokinase. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Clinical overview. Many patients with an acute myocardial infarction can be stratified into subgroups that are at high risk for morbidity and mortality on the basis of clinical characteristics that indicate recurrent myocardial ischemia, persistent left ventricular dysfunction, and/or recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction the assessment of symptoms, physical findings, and ECG changes during predischarge exercise testing often identifies patients at increased risk for further cardiac events. Because of the suboptimum sensitivity and specificity of the exercise ECG for detecting myocardial ischemia, myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl and/or assessment of global and segmental ventricular function by two-dimensional echocardiography or radionuclide cineangiography during or immediately after exercise are often added to the predischarge risk stratification. 
Recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. We describe a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome complicated by recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. The episodes of pericarditis were associated with urticarial vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, and circulating IgG antibodies to the collagen-like region of Clq. Histopathologic examination of the skin and pericardium demonstrated vasculitis associated with immunoglobulin and complement deposition suggesting an immune complex mediated etiology. Recurrent pericarditis should be included in the clinical spectrum of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. 
Symptomatic benefit of supplemental oxygen in hypoxemic patients with chronic lung disease. We have compared the symptomatic benefit of air and oxygen at rest in hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD). A total of 12 severely disabled patients with COAD (mean +/- SEM, PaO2, 50.3 +/- 3.7 mm Hg) and 10 with ILD (PaO2, 48.0 +/- 3.1 mm Hg) received 28% oxygen and air by Venturi face mask, each gas on two occasions, in a double-blind randomized fashion. SaO2 increased (p less than 0.01) in both groups during oxygen breathing: COAD, 85.1 +/- 2.3% versus 93.1 +/- 1.4%; ILD, 85.5 +/- 1.7% versus 94.7 +/- 0.9%. The patients with COAD stated that air helped their breathing on 15 of 24 occasions and that oxygen helped on 22 of 24 occasions (p less than 0.05). In the patients with ILD the values were 6 of 20 and 13 of 20 occasions, respectively (p less than 0.05). In both groups of patients the severity of breathlessness recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower during oxygen breathing: COAD, 29.6 +/- 4.5 versus 45.6 +/- 6.0; ILD, 30.2 +/- 5.1 versus 48.1 +/- 4.4. Ventilation measured by magnetometers was significantly lower during oxygen breathing in the patients with COAD (8.2 +/- 1.0 versus 9.3 +/- 1.1 L/min; p less than 0.05), but the difference between oxygen and air in patients with ILD was not statistically significant (9.3 +/- 1.3 versus 11.2 +/- 1.6 L/min; p greater than 0.05). 
Mitomycin C as an adjuvant treatment to resected gastric cancer. A 10-year follow-up. Seventy consecutive patients were entered in a two-arm randomized trial after surgical resection for locally advanced gastric cancer. In the first arm, 37 patients were included as a control group, receiving no further treatment after surgery. In the second arm, 33 patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of mitomycin C (MMC), 20 mg/m2 administered intravenously once every 6 weeks for four consecutive cycles. All patients in both arms were followed in the same way for 5 years. At 5 years 23 of 37 patients in the control arm and 7 of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse. Actuarial survival curve was statistically significant in favor of patients given adjuvant MMC (p less than 0.001). After 10 years follow-up, 31 of 37 patients in the control arm and 16 out of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse, the statistical differences continuing in the actuarial survival curve in favor of treated patients (p less than 0.01). The best advantages of adjuvant treatment were observed in the T3N0M0 stage. The most frequent relapse site was the peritoneal cavity and the relapse pattern shows special decrease in liver metastases in treated patients. Toxicity was acute and mild. No delayed toxicity or second malignancies were observed. These data suggest that adjuvant MMC after resected surgery of gastric cancer is a successful treatment and its effects are still evident after 10 years of follow-up. 
Mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas. A new pancreatic tumor, called mucin-producing tumor, has received great attention in Japan. These tumors are found inside the pancreatic duct and produce large quantities of copious mucus. The authors examined 22 cases of these tumors histologically and histochemically. In 12 malignant cases, the tumors inside the ducts consisted of cancerous lesions over small areas along with papillary or atypical hyperplasia. Tumors in ten benign cases mainly consisted of papillary hyperplasia. Except for three patients with carcinoma in situ, cancerous tumors infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma and, in some cases, were observed invading the bile duct or duodenum. A mucous histochemical study showed evidence of sialomucin in malignant cases; neutral mucin was dominant in benign cases. Characteristics of this disease were also compared with 13 cases of mucinous cystic neoplasm. From the results, it was concluded that these two diseases can be classified into the same conceptual category. 
A rat model of acute liver necrosis induced by a monoclonal antibody to liver-specific antigen and complement. Acute massive hepatic injury was induced in rats by a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific membrane antigen, and its histological characteristics were investigated. A single intravenous injection of murine ascites containing a monoclonal antibody produced numerous hemorrhagic foci of degenerated and necrotic liver cells predominantly in zones 1 (the periportal area) and 2 (the area of transition between the periportal zone and the perivenular zone) of the liver lobule within 10 min. Massive hepatocellular necroses were observed 1 hr later, but no inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in and around the necrotic foci. Immunohistological study demonstrated marked deposition of the third component of the complement system in the necrotic area. Serum complement activity was sharply decreased immediately after the injection of the antibody, suggesting that the hepatic necrosis is ascribable to a complement-mediated immune attack on the liver cell membrane induced by the antigen-antibody reaction. The hepatic necrosis in response to monoclonal-antibody injection did not progress to a chronic disease and healed almost completely, changing to scar tissues within 2 wk. Although it is not clear whether this hepatic injury has any clinical relevance, this antibody/complement model may be useful for investigating the cause and therapy of hepatic diseases such as fulminant hepatitis. 
Preserved action of a rectus muscle after transection by an encircling solid silicone band. We present a case of anterior migration of a solid silicone band through a lateral rectus muscle. In this patient the action of the lateral rectus was preserved, and this is demonstrated photographically. The possible reasons for this rare complication and the possible mechanism by which lateral rectus activity remained intact are explained. 
Clinical features of Behcet's disease. Report of four cases. Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The unifying histologic reaction pattern is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects predominantly the skin, oral mucosa, and eyes. Many other sites of involvement have been reported but are inconsistently found in individual patients. Early recognition and treatment of Behcet's disease may help prevent devastating permanent sequelae such as blindness. Because oral involvement is often the first manifestation of this disorder, dental practitioners are in a unique position to help these patients. We report four cases of Behcet's disease in North American patients. Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are reviewed. 
Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid cancer. BACKGROUND. The period of neutropenia after autologous bone marrow transplantation results in substantial morbidity and mortality. The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS. No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS. In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration. 
Candida tropicalis and Candida albicans fungemia in children with leukemia. The records were reviewed for all patients hospitalized at a pediatric oncology center for complications of leukemia (n = 822) or lymphoma (n = 290) during an 8-year period. The results of surveillance cultures (throat, rectal, and urine) and blood cultures were analyzed to identify cases of Candida tropicalis and C. albicans colonization and/or fungemia. None of the patients with lymphoma who had positive surveillance cultures for C. albicans (n = 89) or C. tropicalis (n = 23) had fungemia. Among patients with leukemia, significant fungal infection was documented in 12 of 107 colonized with C. tropicalis (11.2%) versus 14 of 700 (2%) colonized with C. albicans (P less than 0.001). The two groups of children with fungemia were similar in primary diagnoses (predominantly acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and in the frequency of several known risk factors for infection, including the duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts, less than 500/microliters). Patients with C. tropicalis fungemia all had disseminated disease compared with nine of 14 patients with C. albicans fungemia. Also, subcutaneous abscesses were unique to patients with C. tropicalis in this series. Two patients in each group died of their infection; central nervous system involvement was present in both fatal cases of C. tropicalis fungemia. A high index of suspicion and the early institution of appropriate antifungal therapy are critical to the successful management of these infections in patients with leukemia. 
Prognostic importance of collateral flow and residual coronary stenosis of the myocardial infarct artery after anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. Residual high-grade coronary stenosis and collateral flow are frequent findings in the chronic phase after a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic importance of a residual stenosis of the infarct artery and of collateral flow to the infarct area was analyzed in a group of 102 young patients (mean age 35 years, range 22 to 39) who had survived an anterior wall Q-wave AMI. Patients whose only significant lesion (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) was in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery were enrolled in the study. A 50 to 74% diameter stenosis was present in 33 of 102 patients (32%), 43 (42%) had a 75 to 99% stenosis and 26% had a total occlusion of the infarct vessel. Collateral vessels, which were evaluated by a scoring system, were present in 52 of 102 patients (51%). Four percent had only faint (score 1), 17 of 102 patients (17%) had moderate and 32 patients (31%) had good collateral flow (score greater than 4). The 8-year cumulative mortality was 15.2%--an eightfold increase compared with the age-matched general population. No patient with less than 75% stenosis died during follow-up, whereas the cumulative 8-year mortality was 23 and 17% in patients with a 75 to 99% stenosis or total occlusion, respectively (p less than 0.01). Patients with at least moderate collateral flow had a mortality rate of 21%, versus 8% for patients without or with faint collateral flow (p less than 0.05). 
Late bleeding after rhytidectomy from injury to the superficial temporal vessels. Five healthy, normotensive women, whose mean age was 49.8 years, developed expanding hematomas between 8 and 10 days (average 9 days) after rhytidectomy. In each patient, the bleeding vessel could be identified: In two, it was the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery; in two, it was the parietal branch of the superficial temporal vein; and in one, it was the superficial temporal artery immediately before its branching. Contributing factors may have been sudden physical exertion in four of the five patients and in another salicylate ingestion. Several measures can help avoid late bleeding from the superficial temporal vessels or their branches; not using a too potent vasoconstrictive agent (epinephrine) in the local anesthetic so that the vessels will be easier to visualize; not injecting the local anesthetic too deeply or incising to deeply; dividing and ligating the superficial temporal vessel and its major branches if injured; using bipolar coagulation on small branches; and instructing patients repeatedly not to engage in strenuous activity or to ingest salicylates for at least 2 weeks after operation. 
Dietary fiber and bowel function in tube-fed patients. In tube-fed patients, dietary fiber is often used to manage constipation/diarrhea. Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Abnormal vascular responses to supine exercise in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. Exercise hypotension has been documented in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is not the result of an inability to augment cardiac output but instead relates to an inappropriate and exaggerated decrease in systemic vascular resistance at high work loads. METHODS AND RESULTS. To enable us to examine the behavior of the peripheral vasculature during exercise, 103 consecutive patients underwent maximal symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with measurement of forearm blood flow. A minimum reduction of 12% from the basal value was defined as a normal response based on the study of 25 normal controls. In the patients, two patterns of forearm blood flow were observed. Sixty-four patients had an appropriate reduction in forearm blood flow of 40 +/- 16% from resting flow. In 39 patients, the forearm blood flow either failed to decrease or increased with exercise by 45 +/- 105% of the resting value. Patients with an abnormal forearm vasodilator response were younger (31 +/- 13 versus 46 +/- 14 years), and more of them had a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death than did those with a normal vasoconstrictor response (16 of 39 versus eight of 64). Left ventricular end-diastolic cavity dimensions were smaller in those with an abnormal forearm blood flow response, but other clinical, echocardiographic, and arrhythmic variables were similar. To assess the relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to erect exercise blood pressure response, patients underwent treadmill exercise testing with careful monitoring of systolic blood pressure response. Thirty-eight patients had significant exercise hypotension with failure of the systolic blood pressure to increase during progressive exercise (n = 6) or an abrupt decrease in systolic blood pressure (20-60 mm Hg) from the peak value (n = 32); 65 patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response, but 18 of these patients had an oscillation in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more early in the recovery phase. Thirty-one of 39 patients with an abnormal forearm blood flow response demonstrated exercise hypotension during the erect exercise testing, and the remaining eight patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response; however, five of these eight had abnormal oscillations in blood pressure during recovery (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to exercise hypotension confirms the observation of hemodynamic instability in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The finding of abnormal vascular responses in patients known to be at increased risk (young age and a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death) suggests that hemodynamic mechanisms may be important in the occurrence of sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Surgical intensive care unit resource use in a specialty referral hospital: I. Predictors of early death and cost implications. The rationing of medical care prioritizes the need for early predictors of death in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). We prospectively studied 100 consecutive SICU admissions, looking for predictors of early death in the SICU and the cost implications of these findings. Serial APACHE II scores on days 1, 3, and 5 were subjected to multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of death in the SICU on day 1. Survivors had significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean day-1 APACHE II scores than had nonsurvivors (13.6 vs 22.1). Half of the patients with scores greater than 18 died, and all patients with scores on day 1 of 25 or greater died. Significant predictors of death on SICU day 1 were APACHE II scores, Acute Physiology Score, Glasgow Coma Score, creatinine level, and Chronic Health Evaluation Score. Forty-one patients had been transferred from community hospitals as a results of acute illness; this population accounted for two thirds of the deaths in the SICU. Ten of 18 nonsurvivors were predicted on day 1, with these patients incurring a total cost of approximately $1 million. If therapy had been modified on days 5, 10, or 15, the potential cost savings would have been $340,000, $240,000, or $140,000, respectively. Integration of the results of this study into the management decision-making process and treatment guidelines may reduce the cost of care in the SICU. 
Aortoiliac dissection after percutaneous insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Aortic or aortoiliac dissection may complicate percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump insertion in various ways. Thrombosis can escape clinical recognition if no major obstruction develops. Death due to perforation after dissection is not uncommon. In this case study, aortoiliac dissection led to bilateral iliac artery stenosis, an unusual complication of percutaneous femoral cannulation for insertion of a balloon pump. 
Effects of heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure on Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time in experimental acute pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary hypertension in humans is characterized by shortening of the pulmonary artery acceleration time as measured by Doppler echocardiography, such that the higher the pulmonary artery pressure, the shorter the pulmonary acceleration time. Increases in heart rate are also known to produce decreases in the pulmonary artery acceleration time. To explore the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, and Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time, experimental acute pulmonary hypertension was created in nine Duroc swine, either by infusion of Sephadex beads with embolization of the pulmonary arterial circulation or by partially occluding the main pulmonary artery 8 to 10 cm distal to the pulmonic valve. Pulmonary artery Doppler flow velocity recordings and invasive pressure measurements were made at baseline and at paced atrial rates ranging from 60 to 160 beats per minute, in 20-beat increments. The results in this acute animal model reveal that increases in heart rate produced significant decreases in Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time at mean pressures below 25 mm Hg. However, with mean pulmonary artery pressures greater than 25 mm Hg, both heart rate and increases in pulmonary artery pressure had no significant effect on acceleration time. 
Hypo-fibrinolysis in patients with hypertension and elevated cholesterol. To test the hypothesis that increased blood pressure and hyperlipidaemia result in changes in the fibrinolytic system, 84 subjects with both hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels (the high risk group) were compared with 55 controls matched with respect to age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and activity were measured before and after venous occlusion. In the high risk group, tPA activity was significantly lower both before and after venous occlusion and PAI-1 levels were significantly higher. In a multivariate analysis the triglyceride levels, diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels were independently associated with the PAI-1 levels. Diastolic blood pressure was independently and inversely associated with resting tPA activity. We conclude that patients with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia have a reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system, an effect which is unrelated to differences in age, sex, smoking or BMI. 
Doppler ultrasound and the silent ductus arteriosus. A clinically undetectable, small ductus arteriosus was identified by Doppler ultrasonography in 21 individuals. Infants were excluded from the study and no patient had pulmonary hypertension. Persistence of the ductus arteriosus is likely to be more common than shown by less sensitive diagnostic methods. Some patients considered to have infective endocarditis with a normal heart may have a silent ductus arteriosus. Evidence of such an association would justify ligation or antibiotic cover as prophylactic measures. 
Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium: occurrence in association with choroidal effusion. Two patients developed large tears of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with choroidal effusion. One tear occurred after combined cataract/filtration surgery complicated by postoperative choroidal detachment; the second developed in a patient with idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome. Weakness of the junctions of the pigment epithelial cells secondary to the accumulation of fluid in the subretinal or suprachoroidal space may result in tearing of the retinal pigment epithelium as it is stretched. 
Cell kinetics of gastrointestinal tumors after different nutritional regimens. A preliminary report. Forty-four cases of different untreated gastrointestinal tumors were studied with regard to cell kinetic activity. As a pilot experiment, we also determined the 3H-TdR Labeling Index (LI) in 28 patients in basal conditions and after 15 days of nutritional manipulation with prevalently lipid-based or glucose-based feeding to ascertain whether selective nutritional regimens could affect tumor proliferation. Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation. Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy. 
HBV-DNA-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in childhood. Report of three cases. In a series of 325 HBV chronically infected children observed over an 18-year period, three developed HCC. These three children were born in southern Italy, a region characterized by a high endemic HBV infection rate; each had been infected perinatally, developed an acute hepatitis, and became a chronic carrier. Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected. The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case. The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years. A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted. 
Localized recurrent postoperative pernio associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A patient with recurrent pernio of the right ankle for 21 years after surgery had a leukocytoclastic vasculitis localized in the area. We suggest that the various histologic descriptions of pernio in the literature and in this case represent different levels of severity of the disease. 
Intraoral reconstruction with a microvascular peritoneal flap. The microvascular peritoneal flap offers a new reconstructive option for closure of intraoral defects. The flap is easy to raise, and donor-site morbidity is low. Unlike fascial flaps, in which the raw surface may take weeks to "mucosalize," the peritoneal surface heals primarily. Finally, the rectus muscle effectively covers all forms of mandibular reconstruction, and the reliable skin paddle makes possible the closure of substantial cutaneous defects. 
Interrelation of analgesia and uterine activity in women with primary dysmenorrhea. A preliminary report. The interrelation between uterine activity and pain from primary dysmenorrhea has been of interest for many years. Objective studies of uterine activity during non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy have supported the assertion that uterine activity causes pain and that reducing that activity leads to pain reduction. Unfortunately, those studies could not refute the counter-assertion that reductions in uterine activity come about because of reduced pain through central analgesia and not by direct pharmacologic action. In an effort to clarify this question, a small number of women were studied using intrauterine pressure recording and analysis to evaluate objective changes in uterine physiology during transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for dysmenorrhea. The preliminary studies indicated that despite successful subjective therapy with TENS, intrauterine pressure parameters remained steady or showed signs of worsening. These findings indicate that TENS provides pure analgesia by an alteration of the body's ability to receive or perceive the pain signal rather than by a direct uterine effect. It appears that the reduction in uterine activity seen in objective drug studies represents direct drug action rather than a change from reduced pain through central analgesic effects. 
Flow characteristics of enteral feeding with psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid added. One therapy for managing diarrhea in patients in intensive care units who are receiving enteral nutrition is administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (PHM). This laboratory study was conducted to determine whether the addition of PHM (Metamucil) to enteral feeding formula (Entrition) adversely affected the flow characteristics of the feeding formula through a small-bore feeding tube. Descriptive data were obtained from 72 trials of feeding formula with varied infusion rates, formula osmolality and temperature, and PHM concentrations. Two thirds (n = 48) of the trials were successful (PHM did not clog the tubing and obstruct flow). The remaining one third of the trials (n = 24) were unsuccessful. Successful formula infusion was influenced by formula temperature and osmolality but not by infusion rate, PHM concentration, or flow interruption. If formula with PHM was followed by formula without PHM, the infusion was successful regardless of infusion rate or formula osmolality. Thus, the data from this laboratory study indicate that when therapeutic doses of PHM are prescribed, it is feasible for PHM to be mixed in room-temperature feeding formula and infused without clogging the feeding tube. 
The role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I in experimental renal growth and scarring. Recent evidence suggests a causal link between early renal/glomerular hypertrophy and late kidney scarring and glomerular sclerosis. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a growth-promoting peptide likely to play a role in the development of kidney growth. We observed an increased renal IGF-I content in two experimental models of accelerated kidney growth in the rat. By contrast, diabetic renal hypertrophy is abolished in the absence of growth hormone (GH). Dietary protein manipulations affect the expression of compensatory renal growth (CRG), as well as renal IGF-I content. The renotrophic effect of a high-protein diet on CRG seems GH-dependent and IGF-I-mediated. GH also appears to have a permissive role on the development of progressive renal scarring following extensive renal ablation in rats, as dwarf rats seem somewhat resistant to the development of accelerated scarring and renal failure. 
Prognosis in T2N0M0 stage I breast carcinoma: a 20-year follow-up study. In a study of prognosis in node-negative breast carcinoma, we investigated 293 T2N0M0 patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection with a median follow-up of 19.8 years. The probability of surviving 20 years considering all causes of death was 41.3% +/- 3.0%. Recurrence-free survival (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 68.6% +/- 3% at 10 years and 63.2% +/- 3.1% at 20 years. The estimated probability of cure determined by the method of Brinkley and Haybittle was 63% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 55% to 72%). Prognosis was related to primary tumor size with the best separation (P = .06) when tumors from 2.1 to 3.0 cm (33% chance of recurrence at 20 years) and from 3.1 to 5.0 cm (44% chance of recurrence at 20 years) were compared. The histologic tumor type was prognostically important. Recurrence at 20 years was not significantly different for patients with invasive duct (34%) and lobular (42%) carcinoma. Women with special types (medullary, mucinous, papillary, etc) of carcinoma had a 25% chance of recurrence. Subsequent contralateral breast carcinoma was diagnosed in 29 patients, and four of these were fatal, accounting for only 4.6% of breast carcinoma deaths. Thirty-two patients (10.9%) developed a nonmammary malignant neoplasm (NMMN) after the ipsilateral breast carcinoma, and 69% of these lesions were fatal. Although the chances of recurrence at 20 years related to tumor size and type did not differ statistically in the series, there were trends that suggest that T2N0M0 patients can be stratified into recurrence risk groups based on tumor size and histologic type. These factors should be taken into consideration in the design and analysis of clinical adjuvant therapy trials. Measures for the early detection of common NMMNs should be included in the routine follow-up of T2N0M0 breast carcinoma patients. 
Serum endothelin-1 concentrations and cold provocation in primary Raynaud's phenomenon To determine whether the vasoconstriction in Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with raised concentrations of the endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET-1), responses to cold pressor testing were examined in 7 subjects with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and in 7 control subjects. Baseline serum ET-1 levels (pg/ml), as measured by radioimmunoassay, were three times higher in Raynaud's subjects (5.3 [SEM 1.7] pg/ml) than in controls (1.7 [0.3]). With progressive local cooling digital arterial pulsatility, as measured by plethysmography, fell earlier and to a greater extent in Raynaud's subjects than in controls, with a half-maximum decrement in pulsatility occurring at 27 [2.6] degrees C and 18 [0.5] degrees C, respectively. Temperature reduction sufficient to cause loss of pulsatility in the Raynaud's subjects produced increases in ET-1 concentrations in both groups that were greater in Raynaud's (10.3 [4.4] pg/ml) than in control subjects (2.7 [0.9] pg/ml). Serum ET-1 in the contralateral arm rose in parallel to but to a lesser extent than that in the cold-challenged arm. Increases in ET-1 concentrations were temporally related to loss of pulsatility but followed the onset of symptoms. Thus the increased basal and stimulated serum endothelin concentrations in Raynaud's disease are associated with the enhanced, prolonged vasospasm of this disorder. 
Embolization of arteriovenous malformations with peripheral aneurysms using ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Report of three cases. The authors report three cases of arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) with aneurysms arising from the feeding artery; all were successfully treated with a new nonadhesive liquid embolic material, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL). In two patients the AVM's were totally removed without difficulty, and in one the AVM was managed conservatively after embolization. No new neurological deficits appeared during or after embolization. After road-mapping techniques, EVAL was injected slowly until the feeding artery and aneurysm were completely obliterated. This embolic agent is easy to handle and is considered safe compared with other adhesive liquid embolic agents, such as isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate or n-butyl cyanoacrylate. It is concluded that EVAL is an excellent agent for embolizing an AVM with a peripheral aneurysm on the feeding artery. 
Duodenal obstruction by a nondeflating Foley catheter gastrostomy tube. We report the case of a 36-year-old mentally retarded man who presented to our emergency department after one day of vomiting and one episode of coffee-ground emesis. The Foley catheter used as his gastrostomy tube was found to be obstructing the duodenum, and the balloon could not be deflated. Removal was accomplished by rupturing the balloon by endoscopy. Our case illustrates one of many possible complications of feeding gastrostomy tubes. 
Soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall. Results of surgical resection. Primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall are uncommon, and data concerning treatment and results are sparse. Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis. To assess the results of surgical treatment, we reviewed our 40-year experience. Methods: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed. Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05. Results: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median, 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases. Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade. Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32, 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23, 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18, 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17, 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14, 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13, 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11, 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4, 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3, 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); and other types (n = 12, 9%). Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%). Local recurrence developed in 27%. Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42, synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90, 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59, 10%). Overall 5-year survival was 66%. Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%, p less than 0.0001). Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic. Conclusions: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities. Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas, but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas. 
Cephalometric measurements in snorers, non-snorers, and patients with sleep apnoea. Cephalometry is often used to assess patients with sleep apnoea but whether these measurements differ from those in non-apnoeic snorers and how they are influenced by age is not clear. Cephalometric radiographs of patients with sleep apnoea were compared with those of snorers without sleep apnoea and those of non-snorers. Fifty two snorers with suspected sleep apnoea had a conventional sleep study and were divided into two groups: those with an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than 10/h (n = 40, sleep apnoea group) and those whose apnoea-hypopnoea index was 10/h or less (n = 12, snorer group). The cephalometric measurements in these patients were compared with those of 34 non-snoring control subjects. Controls were subdivided into two groups: control group 1 included 17 subjects similar in age to the sleep apnoea and snorer groups (mean (SD) age 50.0 (10.9), 50.7 (9.4), and 50.6 (9.7) years); control group 2 included 15 young men (25.4 (2.6) years). The distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H) and the length of the soft palate were greater in the patients with sleep apnoea (28.7 (7.8) and 43.6 (5.0) mm) than in the snorers (23.7 (4.2) and 40.3 (4.9 mm). The MP-H was similar in snorers and age matched control subjects, but was significantly greater in the older than in the younger control subjects (22.1 (6.1) vs 17.0 (6.8]. The soft palate was longer in subjects who snored (both sleep apnoea patients and snorers) than in control subjects. The MP-H distance significantly correlated with age for all subjects (snorers and controls) and for the control subjects alone. This study shows that non-apnoeic snorers have cephalometric abnormalities that differ from those of patients with sleep apnoea and that cephalometric values are influenced by the subject's age. 
Intravascular stents in the management of superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome can be effectively palliated with the use of intravascular stents. Adjunctive modalities which may be utilized prior to stent placement are thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty. Six patients with an underlying malignancy were treated with these modalities. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome. 
Chemicals and environmentally caused diseases in developing countries. This chapter discusses international aspects of diseases resulting from exposure to chemical pollutants in the environment, with an emphasis on developing countries. These countries share many of the same problems of air, water, and pesticide pollution that face the more industrialized countries. In developing countries, however, the problems are compounded by a number of unique situations, viz., economic priorities, high burden of infectious diseases, impoverishment, and absence of a regulatory framework for the disposal of toxic chemicals. This discussion emphasizes the importance of interactions among toxicants, malnutrition, and infectious diseases for both urban and rural populations insofar as these interactions contribute to disease. Toxicants not only produce disease directly but also exacerbate diseases with other causes. Specific examples from developing countries demonstrate how human health effects from exposures to environmental chemicals can be assessed. While they do not strictly fall under the rubric of "developing countries," the public health consequences of inadequate control of environmental pollution in the East European countries should demonstrate the magnitude of the problem, except that in developing countries the public health consequence of environmental chemicals will be aggravated by the widespread malnutrition and high prevalence of infectious diseases. Much needs to be done before we can adequately quantify the contribution of environmental chemicals to morbidity and mortality in developing countries with the level of sophistication now evident in the charting of infectious diseases in these countries. 
Acute spinal cord injury: magnetic resonance imaging correlated with myelopathy. Thirty-one patients (29 males and two females, 13-87 years of age (mean, 46.7 years] with acute spinal cord injury were studied by MR (magnetic resonance) imaging and the results were correlated with neurological findings. Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a 0.5 T superconductive MR scanner (Phillips Gyroscan S5). Initial imaging was performed within 24 hours after trauma in 13 patients, 1-7 days in 13 patients and 7-14 days in five patients. Twenty-six patients underwent follow-up examinations with MR imaging. Cord abnormalities including cord compression (23 patients), cord swelling (seven patients), and abnormal signal intensities on either T1 or T2-weighted images (26 patients) were observed on initial examination. Multivariate analysis showed that cord compression and abnormal intensities on T1-weighted images were important prognostic indicators. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was non-specific but correlated well with clinical recovery. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in predicting the prognosis and for planning treatment following spinal cord injuries. 
Can vitamin D deficiency produce an unusual pain syndrome? An unusual pain occurred in five patients in the presence of compromised vitamin D status and resolved 5 to 7 days after supplementation with vitamin D in the form of ergocalciferol. The pain had a hyperesthetic quality and did not respond to the use of analgesics, including opiate derivatives. Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement. This pain restricts mobility and function and may lead to further complications, such as pressure sores. 
Operations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Forty-six patients with symptomatic tachycardia underwent operations to divide 55 atrioventricular accessory pathways. Mean age was 29 years (range 11 to 63). Ten patients (22%) had associated cardiac disease, including two with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus and six (13%) who had concomitant surgical procedures. A bipolar hand-held electrode was used in 22 operations, and simultaneous multisite mapping in the last 24 operations. Ten patients (22%) had multiple accessory pathways. A modified endocardial approach was used. The overall patient success rate was 93% with 91% to 93% of accessory pathways successfully divided. The perioperative morbidity was 17%. There were two reoperations. There were no early or late deaths. Patients have been followed up for a mean of 16 months. There were five recurrences of preexcitation (two early, three late). Two of these patients (both with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus) had reoperation. One patient had late recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Operation for the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has a high probability of success with a low operative risk. 
Oral contraceptives and coronary heart disease. In industrialized countries, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major public health problem for both men and women. Preventive strategies for reducing the excessive mortality and morbidity associated with CHD involve the identification and modification of metabolic factors believed to be involved in the disease process. Three major areas of concern are lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and the hemostatic system. The steroid hormones contained in oral contraceptives (OCs) have been shown to interfere in all three areas. In many instances OCs have been shown to alter metabolic markers for CHD in directions associated with increased risk. Although evidence is lacking that such changes induce CHD in users of modern, low-dose OCs, it would be prudent to develop formulations with a minimal impact on metabolic risk markers. There is increasing evidence that many of the metabolic disturbances seen in CHD patients share a common origin, and the development of risk-free OCs is likely to require investigation into complex interrelationships. 
Demonstration of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans: results of a pilot study utilizing acute coronary angioplasty with perfluorochemical in anterior myocardial infarction. Reperfusion may limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol) significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing Fluosol as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30-min intracoronary infusion of Fluosol at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and Fluosol) had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary Fluosol versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 +/- 3.1% vs. 8 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.02; and -1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.2 SD/chord, p less than 0.05). 
The rectus abdominis free flap in head and neck reconstruction. The rectus abdominis musculocutaneous free flap, based on the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein, has been used widely in reconstruction of the breast and extremities. The number of reports on its applications in the head and neck is limited. The rectus abdominis free flap is one of the most versatile soft-tissue flaps. The deep inferior epigastric artery and vein are long, large-diameter vessels that are ideal for microvascular anastomoses. The area of skin that can be transferred is probably the largest of all flaps presently in use. The versatility of this donor site is due to the ability to transfer large areas of skin with varying thicknesses and varying amounts of underlying muscle. We have successfully used this flap in 15 consecutive patients to reconstruct defects of the neck, face, mouth, pharynx, skull base, and scalp. No major complications involving either the recipient or donor sites occurred. The literature on the use of the rectus abdominis flap in head and neck reconstruction is reviewed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of this soft-tissue free flap are thoroughly discussed in an effort to better define its proper place among the reconstructive options available to the head and neck surgeon. 
Effect of dietary proteins and lipids in patients with membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome. Twenty-four patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, long-lasting nephrotic syndrome and serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dl ate sequentially, in a randomized cross-over design, a normal protein diet containing 1.1 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day of proteins and a low protein diet containing 0.7 +/- 0.1 g/kg/day of protein, each diet for a period of 3 months. Both diets were low in fat (less than 30% of total calories) and cholesterol (less than 200 mg/day) content and rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and in linoleic acid (10% of energy). Random assignment to one of the two 3 month diet periods was done after a RUN-IN period of at least one month on the hypolipidic normal protein diet. Glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), 24 hour urinary protein loss and serum albumin concentration did not significantly differ at the end of the two diet periods, indicating that long-term restriction of protein intake does not modify GFR or urinary protein loss in nephrotic patients. Serum total and LDL-cholesterol and daily proteinuria were significantly lower at the end of both diet periods than at the beginning and at the end of the RUN-IN period. We suggest that these changes were a consequence of the manipulation of dietary fat intake. 
Ofloxacin versus parenteral therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. We conducted a randomized comparison of oral ofloxacin (400 mg twice a day) and parenteral agents (cefazolin, 1.0 g intravenously every 8 h, or ceftazidime, 2.0 g intravenously every 12 h) in biopsy-confirmed, nonprosthesis osteomyelitis. A total of 19 subjects received ofloxacin for an average of 8 weeks, and 14 received parenteral antibiotics for an average of 4 weeks; both therapies were well tolerated. Infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus (40%), Enterococcus spp. (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), and other gram-negative organisms (42%). At the completion of therapy, one P. aeruginosa infection in the ofloxacin group persisted and the organism acquired resistance, accompanied by a resistant Acinetobacter superinfection. In the parenteral group, one S. aureus infection persisted, and there was a resolved superinfection due to S. aureus as well. Eighteen-month follow-up data have been obtained. Among those treated with ofloxacin, four subjects whose initial response to therapy was successful suffered relapses of infection, three due to S. aureus and one due to P. aeruginosa, while in the parenteral group, one subject with a P. aeruginosa infection relapsed. Long-term response to therapy was successful for 14 of 19 (74%) subjects who received ofloxacin and 12 of 14 (86%) who received parenteral antibiotics; the difference was not significant. Oral ofloxacin appears comparable to parenteral antibiotics in chronic osteomyelitis due to susceptible organisms, and oral ofloxacin offers advantages in economics and convenience. 
Auditory screening of infants. Within the last 20 years, infant hearing screening has progressed from a laudable goal to a state-mandated reality in many areas of the United States. The high risk register provides a means by which history and neonatal physical examination can be used to identify the infant at risk for hearing loss. Two procedures (crib-O-gram and auditory brainstem-evoked response) have been the most common methods of screening for hearing loss in the newborn or in intensive care nurseries. Evoked cochlear emissions reportedly are identifiable in 90 to 100% of normal-hearing infants. This observation has lead to the use of evoked otoacoustic emissions as a hearing screening procedure with infants. 
SWIFT trial of delayed elective intervention v conservative treatment after thrombolysis with anistreplase in acute myocardial infarction. SWIFT (Should We Intervene Following Thrombolysis?) Trial Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To see whether early elective angiography with a view to coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting of a stenosed infarct related vessel would improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis with anistreplase. DESIGN--Randomised study of two treatment strategies with analysis of results over 12 months. SETTING--21 district hospitals and regional cardiac centres in Britain and Ireland. SUBJECTS--800 of 993 patients presenting with clinical and electrocardiographic features of acute myocardial infarction up to three hours after the onset of major symptoms. TREATMENT STRATEGIES--Intravenous anistreplase 30 units followed by a standard regimen of heparin, warfarin, and timolol and (in patients so randomised) early angiography plus appropriate intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death or reinfarction within 12 months. RESULTS--397 patients were randomised to receive early angiography plus appropriate intervention (coronary angioplasty in 169 cases, coronary grafting in 59) and 403 patients to receive conservative care (of these, 12 had angioplasty and seven bypass grafting during the initial admission). By 12 months mortality (5.8% (23 patients) in the intervention group v 5.0% (20) in the conservative care group; p = 0.6) and rates of reinfarction (15.1% (60 patients) v 12.9% (52); p = 0.4) were similar in the two groups. No significant differences in rates of angina or rest pain were found at 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction at three and 12 months was the same in both groups. Median hospital stay was longer in the intervention group (11 days v 10 days; p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION--For most patients given thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction a strategy of angiography and intervention is appropriate only when required for clinical indications. 
Chondromyxoid fibroma: radiographic appearance in 38 cases and in a review of the literature [published erratum appears in Radiology 1991 Aug;180(2):586] Thirty-eight cases of histologically confirmed chondromyxoid fibroma were reviewed and their radiographic features recorded. These findings, coupled with a review of the English-language medical literature, suggest that this rare, benign bone tumor has a characteristic but not specific radiographic appearance and may often mimic more common tumors. Chondromyxoid fibroma may occur anywhere in the skeleton, but almost half of the cases occur around the knee. The possibility of chondromyxoid fibroma should always be considered when a focal bone lesion is evaluated that has geographic bone destruction, a sclerotic rim, lobulated margins, and septation. The diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma is most likely when the patient is in the 2nd decade of life. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Risk factors for injurious falls: a prospective study. We conducted a prospective study of the consequences of falls in 325 elderly community-dwelling persons, all of whom had fallen in the previous year. We contacted subjects every week for one year to ascertain falls and to determine the circumstances and consequences of falls. Only 6% of 539 falls resulted in a major injury (fracture, dislocation, or laceration requiring suture), but over half (55%) resulted in minor soft tissue injury. One in ten falls left the faller unable to get up for at least 5 minutes, and one in four falls caused subjects to limit their activities. The risk of injury per fall was about the same regardless of the number of falls a person had during follow-up. The risk of major injury was increased (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio: 5.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-14.9) in falls associated with loss of consciousness compared to nonsyncopal falls. In multivariate analyses of nonsyncopal falls, the risk of major injury per fall was higher in persons having a previous fall with fracture (6.7; 2.1-21.5), a slower Trail Making B time (1.9; 1.1-3.2), and in Whites (18.4; 7.5-44.6). The risk that a nonsyncopal fall would result in minor injury (versus no injury) was increased in persons with a slower hand reaction time (1.8; 1.0-3.2) decreased grip strength (1.5; 1.0-2.3), in Whites (2.0; 1.0-3.7), in falls while using stairs and steps (2.2; 1.0-5.0), and turning around or reaching (3.5; 1.7-7.3). Our findings suggest that neuromuscular and cognitive impairment, as well as the circumstances of falls, affect the risk of injury when a fall occurs. 
The day-long antianginal effectiveness of nitroglycerin patches. A double-blind study using dose-titration. This study was designed to determine the day-long antianginal effectiveness of nitroglycerin patches in the nitrate-exposed patient, as well as the doses required. Eight men with chronic stable angina, a positive treadmill test, and demonstrated responsiveness to long-term oral isosorbide dinitrate were studied after they had been taking effective doses of isosorbide dinitrate three times a day for at least two weeks. Treadmill exercise bouts were performed every 1 to 2 hours over 1 day, after the 8 am application of active nitroglycerin patches in a previously titrated dose, and on another day after application of placebo patches. Mean necessary effective patch dose was 125 sq cm (60 to 220 sq cm). Mean exercise duration to angina rose from 271 to 480 s (p less than 0.001) 1 hour after active patches, while resting systolic blood pressure fell from 122 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). (After placebo patches: +19 s and -2 mm Hg, respectively.) Active patches were superior to placebo throughout the day, but in declining degree (by 94 s at 7 pm, p less than 0.05). Thus, nitroglycerin patches can provide a significant day-long antianginal effect in the patient with long-term exposure to nitrate. However, the need for large doses and individual titration may make this therapy impractical. 
Laser cordectomy for T1 glottic carcinoma: a 10-year experience and videostroboscopic findings. Fifty-three patients underwent laser cordectomy for T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma between January 1980 and December 1989--sixteen after having undergone unsuccessful radiation and thirty-seven who had no previous treatment. There was a 51% five-year cure rate in the irradiated group vs. 62% in the nonirradiated group. Extension of tumor to the anterior commissure resulted in a higher failure rate. Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies. Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy. The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients. All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed. Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results. Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications. However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure. 
Crossover ilioprofunda reconstruction: an expanded role for obturator foramen bypass. The standard obturator foramen bypass extends from the aorta or iliac artery to the ipsilateral superficial femoral or popliteal artery. This operation has been both effective and versatile as an indirect bypass procedure for circumventing difficult vascular problems in the femoral triangle. A case is presented of a patient whose limb was salvaged by an obturator foramen bypass from the contralateral iliac artery to the profunda femoris artery. This unique case is compared to other published cases to emphasize the potential advantages of the profunda femoris as the preferred graft outflow in selected cases of arterial reconstruction through the obturator foramen. 
Antibiotic treatment of bacterial gastroenteritis. Antibiotic treatment is important in certain etiologies of bacterial gastroenteritis, both for clinical improvement and for eradication of the causative organism from stools, which is important epidemiologically. The etiology, however, is seldom known at presentation in sporadic cases of diarrhea. Thus the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy and the choice of the specific antimicrobial agents should be made on a clinical basis, before culture results are available. 
Regulation of B cell antigen receptor signal transduction and phosphorylation by CD45. CD45 is a member of a family of membrane proteins that possess phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, and is the source of much of the tyrosine phosphatase activity in lymphocytes. In view of its enzymatic activity and high copy number, it seems likely that CD45 functions in transmembrane signal transduction by lymphocyte receptors that are coupled to activation of tyrosine kinases. The B cell antigen receptor was found to transduce a Ca(2+)-mobilizing signal only if cells expressed CD45. Also, both membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) and CD45 were lost from the surface of cells treated with antibody to CD45, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins. Finally, CD45 dephosphorylated a complex of mIg-associated proteins that appears to function in signal transduction by the antigen receptor. These data indicate that CD45 occurs as a component of a complex of proteins associated with the antigen receptor, and that CD45 may regulate signal transduction by modulating the phosphorylation state of the antigen receptor subunits. 
Multicenter evaluation of efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new first-line antihypertensive drug, isradipine, in a Latin-American population. Isradipine, a new antihypertensive dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was evaluated for its efficacy, tolerability, and safety in 91 ambulatory patients who had mild-to-moderate hypertension. The design of the present study included a two-week wash-out period after confirmation of disease, followed by 12 weeks of active treatment with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily. Patients were switched from other antihypertensive drugs, mainly diuretics and beta-blockers. The dose of isradipine remained virtually unchanged throughout the study and resulted in a mean decrease of 22 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P less than .00001) and 19 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P less than .00001). Heart rate was unchanged (difference of -1 beats/min), as was the mean body weight of the study patients. Isradipine was generally well tolerated. Side effects were few and, when present, tended to diminish and eventually disappear during the treatment period. All of the clinical laboratory parameters tested and electrocardiograph intervals remained unchanged. In conclusion, these results indicate that isradipine is a novel drug which is highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this group of patients. 
Diagnosis and management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension are at increased risk for the development of superimposed preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and poor perinatal outcome. The frequency of these complications is particularly increased in patients with severe hypertension and those with preexisting cardiovascular and renal disease. Such women should receive appropriate antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being. In contrast, in patients with mild essential chronic hypertension, the maternal and perinatal benefits from antihypertensive medications are highly controversial. A review of the literature revealed two placebo-controlled studies, four trials comparing treatment versus no medication, and three comparisons of methyldopa and oxprenolol. In only one of these studies were subjects randomized in the first trimester. No differences in pregnancy outcome were found with the use of antihypertensive drugs. Evaluation of the woman with chronic hypertension who is considering pregnancy should begin before conception to establish the cause and severity of the hypertension. Appropriate management should include frequent evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being; antihypertensive medications may be useful in patients with severe disease as well as in those with target organ involvement. 
Gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway diseases. GER can have important impacts on the upper airway passages, and in turn, upper airway obstruction can certainly aggravate reflux. This relationship should be considered in the newborn or young infant, faced with a sudden life-threatening event, and in the older child or adult presenting with chronic head and neck complaints, either unexplained or unresponsive to adequate medical therapy. A causal relationship may be difficult to establish, based first on clinical expertise as a guideline, on laboratory tests, among which pharyngeal pH monitoring could be promising, and on response to medical antireflux therapy. A better understanding of the significance of high levels of reflux and defective acid clearance, as well as a more precise knowledge of the maturation and functioning of upper airway protective mechanisms, would open the way to more accurate diagnostic procedures, to a more reliable definition of the abnormal, and to greater efficiency in the management of these patients. 
Emergency management of the nondeflating Foley catheter balloon. Inability to remove a self-retaining (Foley) catheter may result from failed attempts to deflate its balloon. In this article, the authors review the causes of inability to deflate Foley catheters as well as the various techniques for their removal. 
Post-prandial worsening of angina: all due to changes in cardiac output? BACKGROUND--The precise mechanism leading to the post-prandial worsening of angina has yet to be adequately defined. It has been attributed to an increase in double product but is perhaps more likely to be related to an increase in cardiac output after food. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of food on patients' exercise tolerance and compare these with changes in haemodynamic variables. METHODS--23 patients with chronic stable angina who had post-prandial worsening of their angina were studied. The patients were evaluated on two occasions and at each visit they underwent two symptom limited treadmill exercise tests. They remained fasting on the first visit and were given a 1400 kcal meal 60 minutes before the second exercise test on the second visit. Time to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression, heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured at rest and during exercise. RESULTS--There were no differences in any of the variables during the two exercise tests on the day the patients remained fasting. After the meal exercise tolerance fell significantly by 136 seconds and the stage at which 1 mm ST segment depression was first seen was also significantly reduced. Resting cardiac output increased significantly by 0.86 1/min with the patients sitting and by 0.89 1/min standing. The exercise times after food were significantly related to cardiac output even when fasting times were taken into account. Resting heart rate increased significantly by 8.3 beats per minute sitting and 10.4 beats per minute standing. There was little change in blood pressure and no evidence that the double product predicted the post-prandial exercise time. CONCLUSIONS--Worsening of angina was related to the increase in cardiac output after a meal and successful treatment will depend upon the prevention of this increase. 
Headache spectrum in Arnold-Chiari malformation. Exertional headaches in patients with Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) are well described. We report four patients with Type I ACM and recurrent headaches. These patients presented, respectively, with low spinal fluid pressure headache, migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and migraine with prolonged aura. This report suggests the need for observing patients with recurrent headaches for any physical stigmata of craniovertebral junction anomalies, and the need to exclude ACM in such patients. Possible implications of the association between ACM and different types of headaches are discussed. 
Influence of type of prosthesis on late results after combined mitral-aortic valve replacement. The influence of type of prosthesis on the late outcome of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement was analyzed by comparing, at a 14-year follow-up, patients receiving two biological prostheses (group 1; n = 135), two mechanical prostheses (group 2; n = 221), or a mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position and a bioprosthesis in the mitral position (group 3; n = 97). No difference was found among the three groups in terms of actuarial survival and incidence of and freedom from valve-related deaths, thromboemboli, and hemorrhages. Patients with biological prostheses had a significantly greater incidence of structural valve deterioration, reoperations, and overall complications when compared with patients with only mechanical prostheses. The results of an extended follow-up of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement indicate that mechanical prostheses perform better in the long-term owing to their superior durability when compared with biological valves. The use of bioprostheses should be confined to old patients with limited life expectancy because of their cardiac disease, provided that anticoagulants are not used. Combination of mechanical and biological prostheses in the same patient should be avoided because the advantages of each type of prosthesis are lost. 
CT appearance of splenic injuries managed nonoperatively. This essay illustrates the appearance of the traumatized spleen on CT scans obtained during the course of conservative treatment. Although the CT appearance of acute rupture of the spleen has been adequately described, little has been reported about the appearance of the spleen as it heals after trauma. Examples of CT studies of splenic injuries illustrate the various changes in appearance over time in the traumatized spleen that is treated nonoperatively. 
Progress in cancer. Definite progress has been made against cancer since the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971. Physicians are giving increased attention to cancer prevention. The exciting changes in molecular biology provide increased knowledge about basic mechanisms in tumor growth and metastases. Detailed discussions of two common solid cancers--breast and colorectal--attest to continuing advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All of these augur well for further progress in oncology. Continued research, basic and clinical, is mandatory. 
Percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy and decompression with a 6.9-millimeter cannula. Analysis of operative failures and complications. The operative failures and complications of percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy were analyzed in 100 patients who had a herniated nucleus pulposus and were prospectively studied and treated with use of a 6.9-millimeter outer-diameter (4.9-millimeter inner-diameter) sheath and manual insertion of the instruments. Twelve operations were considered to have failed, regardless of the length of postoperative follow-up or the incidence of reinjury; eleven patients had a repeat operation at the index level, and one patient was a chronic drug-abuser. In eight of the eleven patients, subsequent laminectomy was successful. Two patients had a psoas hematoma and one had a transitory sensory and distal motor deficit; all of these complications resolved without sequelae. There were no major complications, including superficial or deep infection, and no patient had neurovascular compromise. 
Palliation of proximal malignant biliary obstruction by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. For four years up to December 1987, 190 patients (median age 73 years) with proximal malignant biliary obstruction were treated by endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. Altogether 101 had cholangiocarcinoma, 21 gall bladder carcinoma, 20 local spread of pancreatic carcinoma, and 48 metastatic malignancy. Fifty eight patients had type I, 54 type II, and 78 type III proximal biliary strictures (Bismuth classification). All patients were either unfit or unsuitable for an attempt at curative surgical resection. A single endoprosthesis was placed initially, with a further stent being placed only if relief of cholestasis was insufficient or sepsis developed in undrained segments. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique was used to place the endoprosthesis when appropriate, after failed endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion or for second endoprosthesis placement. Full follow up was available in 97%.Thirteen patients were still alive at the time of review and all but one had been treated within the past six months. Initial endoprosthesis insertion succeeded technically at the first attempt in 127 patients, at the second in 30, and at a combined procedure in a further 13 (cumulative total success rate 89% - type I: 93%; type II: 94%; and type III: 84%). There was adequate biliary drainage after single endoprosthesis insertion in 152 of the 170 successful placements, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 80%. Three patients had a second stent placed by combined procedure because of insufficient drainage, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 82% (155 of 190). The final overall drainage success rates were type I: 91%; type II: 83%; and type III: 73%. The early complication rates were type I: 7%; type II: 14%; and type III: 31%. 
Complications after intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin: rhabdomyolysis and metastatic infection. Two cases of adverse reaction to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) bladder instillations are reported. In both cases transient fevers and systemic symptoms developed following the instillations. After an additional instillation 1 patient had high fevers, severe myalgias and profound weakness followed by rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure, which required 3 weeks of hemodialysis before recovery. Extensive evaluation revealed no cause other than the BCG instillations. In the other patient a firm subcutaneous nodule gradually developed on the chest wall, which contained nonviable acid fast bacilli. 
Recurrence of ectopic pregnancy: the role of salpingitis. We evaluated the role of salpingitis on the recurrence of ectopic pregnancy from a historical cohort of 2501 women who had undergone laparoscopic examination for acute salpingitis. We used pregnancy (N = 2899) as the unit of analysis and a modified conditional logistic regression to estimate a pairwise odds ratio as a measure of the recurrence of ectopic pregnancy. Among the second or higher order of pregnancy, the recurrence was 21.7%. For pregnancies with a prior uterine pregnancy, the ectopic pregnancy rate increased with prior salpingitis scores constructed from a combination of prior salpingitis episodes and severity (0 score, 2.7%; 1 to 2 scores, 4.8%; and greater than or equal to 3 scores, 12.1%). For those with a prior ectopic pregnancy, the rate did not increase with prior salpingitis scores (score 0, 20.0%; score 1 or 2, 19.2%; and score greater than or equal to 3, 26.9%). The adjusted pairwise odds ratio was 2.2 and was practically unchanged (2.1) after additional adjustment with prior salpingitis scores. These findings confirm salpingitis as a risk factor for first ectopic pregnancy, but once a woman had an ectopic pregnancy, previous salpingitis might not add any incremental risk. 
Effectiveness of nitrous oxide in a rural EMS system. Prehospital systems need a safe, effective analgesic agent for the treatment of patients suffering from pain. Recent studies have documented the efficacy of nitrous oxide in urban and rural settings. This study reviews the findings on 200 patients (157 trauma, 23 medical, 18 musculoskeletal problems) who received nitrous oxide during a 28-month period in a rural EMS system. Eighty-five percent of the patients reported pain relief. Only minor side effects were noted. Patient satisfaction was high, and there was no abuse noted among personnel. 
Iatrogenic epidermoid cyst of the parotid region following ear surgery. Iatrogenic implantation of squamous epithelium may result in formation of an epidermoid cyst. These cysts have been described in various sites around the head and neck following otological procedures. A case of iatrogenic epidermal cyst in the parotid region following repeated myringoplasty is reported. The clinical features and differential diagnosis are discussed. 
Epidural blood patch for treatment of subarachnoid fistula in children. A subarachnoid-cutaneous fistula developed in two children after the placement of a catheter in the subarachnoid space for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. The management of this iatrogenic complication with epidural blood patch is described. 
The value of estrogen and progesterone receptor determinations in advanced breast cancer. Estrogen receptor level but not progesterone receptor level correlates with response to tamoxifen. Four hundred fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer with known hormone receptor status received primary treatment with tamoxifen. Measured values for the estrogen receptor (ER, i.e., with estrogen binding) followed a continuous distribution (range, 3 to 1000 fmol/mg of protein). These values correlated positively with age. The response to treatment with tamoxifen correlated with the ER level, with response rates of approximately 80% when the ER level was greater than 30.1 fmol/mg of protein. Two hundred eighteen (218 of 415, 52%) patients had progesterone receptor (PR) values greater than 10 fmol/mg. The PR positivity correlated with the ER level. Patients with PR levels greater than 10 fmol/mg of protein (124 of 226, 55%) had a significantly higher response rate than those with values less than 10 fmol/mg of protein (45 of 189, 24%). However, in a multivariate analysis including both receptor levels, age, site, and number of metastases, only the ER level was significant in predicting the response to treatment with tamoxifen. A quantitative estimation of the ER level thus is the best predictor of response to hormonal treatment with tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer. 
Regional intravenous ketanserin and guanethidine therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. The authors report the results of a study of 25 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (primary, posttraumatic, and secondary to diffuse connective tissue diseases) treated with regional intravenous injections of guanethidine or ketanserin. These two drugs were chosen because of the different etiopathologic profiles of the conditions. All the patients showed a substantial clinical improvement with a remission of trophic lesions. Conditions secondary to connective tissue disorders did not demonstrate much improvement based on instrumental data alone, possibly because of the intrinsic limitations of the techniques used for evaluating peripheral blood flow. This specific type of pharmaceutical treatment appeared to be especially suitable for this disease owing to a combination of therapeutic efficacy and a substantial reduction in the total dosage for each patient. 
The axial load teardrop fracture. A biomechanical, clinical and roentgenographic analysis. The anteroinferior cervical vertebral body corner fracture was originally described by Schneider and Cann as the "teardrop" fracture. This report analyzes the biomechanical, clinical, and roentgenographic features of 55 such fractures obtained from the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. Teardrop fractures resulting from tackle football characteristically occurred in players attempting to make a tackle in which initial contact was made with the top or crown of the helmet. There were two fracture patterns associated with the anteroinferior corner (teardrop) fracture fragment: 1) the isolated fracture, which is usually not associated with permanent neurologic sequelae; and 2) the three-part, two-plane fracture in which there is an associated sagittal vertebral body fracture as well as fracture of the posterior neural arch. This latter pattern was almost always associated with permanent neurologic sequelae, specifically quadriplegia. Axial loading of the cervical spine was clearly identified as a mechanism of injury for both fracture patterns. Roentgenographic examination must include both anteroposterior and lateral views with computed tomography or tomography as necessary to determine the presence of the sagittal vertebral body fracture and the integrity of the posterior neural arch. 
Facial weakness. A comparison of clinical and photographic methods of observation. The search for an internationally acceptable facial grading system has resulted in an assessment of existing methods by several investigators. These studies were based on observations of video film taken of patients with varying degrees of facial malfunction. Although the grading systems were evaluated, the use of videotape has never been compared with clinical examination and its suitability for this type of work is, therefore, unknown. We used nine facial grading systems to compare the results of clinical observation with those of photographic methods of presentation. The latter included videotape, photographic slides, and a combination of the two. The correlation between clinical examination findings and findings of any of the photographic methods was poor, suggesting the need for a standard form of presentation when grading patients. The most consistent results were found with either clinical examination or photographic slides; videotape was the least reliable. 
Pattern of simulated snoring is different through mouth and nose. Cineradiography of the pharynx during simulated snoring was done in 6 healthy volunteers, and supraglottic pressure and flow rate were recorded in 12 others. We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls. The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth. During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations. Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate. Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz). This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring. At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring. 
Defining the proper role for self-administered sublingual nitroglycerin. A survey of physicians and patients. Within a half-year period, we encountered six cases of patients harmed by the adverse effects of self-administered nitroglycerin--syncope, delayed definitive medical care, and the worsening of nonischemic symptoms. We therefore surveyed 112 patients after a remote myocardial infarction, and 121 cardiologists and internists, regarding the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Of the physicians, 84 percent routinely prescribed nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction, and 79 percent of the patients had the tablets available (83 percent of these, at all times). Most patients used the tablets less than once per month, and 37 percent of the patients who always carried nitroglycerin had not used it at all during the preceding year. Although 89 percent of the patients claimed to know when to use the drug, 57 percent had used it or would use it for symptoms such as dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or presyncope. All patients having nitroglycerin claimed it relieved their symptoms, even if the relief was only partial, the time elapsed until relief could not be specified, and the symptoms were of a type unlikely to be relieved by the drug. We suggest that the practice of routinely prescribing nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction should be reassessed. 
Clinical course and roentgenographic changes of osteonecrosis in the femoral condyle under conservative treatment. The history of osteonecrosis in the femoral condyle of the knee was observed in 15 knees in 14 patients, averaging 62.8 years in age (range, 23-79 years). There were nine women and five men. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years (range, one to 12 years). Spontaneous osteonecrosis was found in 11 patients and steroid-induced osteonecrosis in three. The medial femoral condyles were involved in 13 knees and the lateral femoral condyles in two. The maximum width of the lesion was measured on anteroposterior roentgenograms and an osteonecrotic lesion less than 10 mm wide was rated as small. Cases of small osteonecrotic lesions displayed no remarkable changes with respect to stages and limb alignment. The average size of the steroid-induced osteonecrotic lesions was significantly larger than that of the spontaneous type. The size of the osteonecrotic lesions at the follow-up examination was compared to that observed at the initial diagnosis in 12 knees. Eight of these lesions displayed increases in dimension of more than 18% over the initial size at diagnosis. 
Safety and cost effectiveness of combined coronary angiography and angioplasty. If coronary angioplasty can be safely performed at the time of the initial diagnostic catheterization, it may result in shorter hospitalization stays and lower overall costs. Combined coronary angiography and angioplasty was performed electively on 733 patients between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1988. These patients were divided into three major subgroups based upon their indications for angioplasty: 444 (61%) procedures were performed for restenosis; 190 (26%) procedures were performed in patients for unstable angina; and 99 (13%) procedures were performed in patients without unstable angina or previous angioplasty. A subset of 219 patients from this study who underwent elective combined coronary angiography and angioplasty during 1986 were compared with a matched population of 191 patients from the angiography and angioplasty as separate procedures). The success and complication rates were similar for both of these groups. Patients who underwent the combined procedure were hospitalized for a mean of 4.6 days with average total charges of $11,128, compared with 8.0 days and $13,160 for patients undergoing separate procedures (p less than 0.001). Significant savings were also realized with respect to total contrast dose, fluoroscopic time, and total procedural time. Thus in informed patients with suitable coronary anatomy, the strategy of combined angiography and angioplasty may present an opportunity for decreasing hospitalization stay, reducing total charges for revascularization, and reducing radiation exposure without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the procedure. 
Prospective study of porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty. Seventy-five uncemented porous-coated total hip prostheses were implanted in 64 patients. The results were reviewed after a mean follow-up period of 47 months (range, 40-64 months). The mean preoperative rating was fair, and the mean postoperative rating was excellent. There were six dislocations. Ten patients had mild thigh pain at one year; by two years, the pain had resolved in six patients. Neither moderate nor severe limp nor significant loosening of beads was observed. Only one patient had progressive radiolucent lines. The high rate of dislocation may be related to a compromise of acetabular position to obtain bony fixation in acetabula early in the series. The clinical results were encouraging. 
Comparison of the effects of torasemide and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized, double-blind study. In a randomized double-blind trial we compared the effects of torasemide, a new loop diuretic, and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites during a 3-day period in association with potassium canrenoate (200 mg/day) administration. Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed. 
Reduction in the frequency of ventricular late potentials after acute myocardial infarction by early thrombolytic therapy. Ventricular late potentials are strong predictors of arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To assess the effect of intravenous thrombolysis on the incidence of ventricular late potentials, 223 consecutive patients surviving a first AMI were included in the present study: 59 patients (53 men, 6 women, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 10 years) received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 mg over 3 hours, group A) and 164 patients (123 men, 41 women, mean age 61 +/- 11 years) received conventional medical treatment (group B). A time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiogram and a high-resolution beat-to-beat recording (gain 10(6), filters 100 to 300 Hz) were performed at 10 +/- 3 days after AMI. There was no difference between group A and B patients in terms of AMI location (anterior in 28 of 59 vs 80 of 164, difference not significant [NS]), mean left ventricular ejection fraction (55 +/- 10 vs 55 +/- 13%, NS), or presence of heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV in 12 of 59 vs 40 of 164, NS). The incidence of ventricular late potentials was 10% (6 of 59) in group A and 24% (39 of 164) in group B (p less than 0.05). Among the 146 patients who underwent coronary arteriography, the incidence of ventricular late potentials was 13% (10 of 80) in patients with a patent infarct-related artery and 26% (17 of 66) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (p less than 0.05). 
Aztreonam monotherapy as prophylaxis in transurethral resection of the prostate: a multicenter study. The efficacy and safety of aztreonam in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infection following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in patients with preoperatively sterile urine were studied in a multicenter trial including 300 patients at six Italian urology centers. The present report describes the first 192 patients enrolled in the protocol. Aztreonam or placebo was administered to each patient in three doses, which were given at the induction of anesthesia and 8 and 16 hours later. The development of bacteriuria was monitored by cultures of urine obtained before surgery, 3 days later, at removal of the bladder catheter, at discharge from the hospital, and at a follow-up visit 39-46 days after surgery. A febrile peak was observed for 6% of aztreonam-treated patients and for 20.9% of the placebo group (P less than .005), while bacteriuria was reported in 17.9% and 59.3% of these groups, respectively (P less than .001). From our data, TURP appears to be a clean-contaminated procedure requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, and aztreonam appears to reduce significantly the incidence of postoperative bacteriuria after this surgical procedure. 
Ocular findings in Turcot syndrome (glioma-polyposis). Turcot syndrome is a hereditary condition characterized by multiple, adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps associated with neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. The authors examined a patient with Turcot syndrome who had multiple regions of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) with areas of surrounding hypopigmentation in the fundi of both eyes. Multiple, bilateral patches of CHRPE have been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. This finding is thought to be a sensitive and specific clinical marker for these conditions and useful for predicting the presence and development of colorectal polyposis. Our findings provide further evidence that familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, and Turcot syndrome may be related conditions representing the variable phenotypic expression of a single, autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Children and young adults with multiple patches of CHRPE and a family history of adenomatous polyposis may be at increased risk for the development of central nervous system tumors as well as gastrointestinal polyps. 
Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. 
Use of a marshmallow bolus for evaluating lower esophageal mucosal rings. Sixty-three patients (35 women, 28 men; mean age 55 yr) with lower esophageal mucosal ring shown radiographically were examined with a semi-solid bolus consisting of a portion of a standard marshmallow. The most common symptom was dysphagia, present in 46 (73%) patients. Impaction of the marshmallow bolus by the ring occurred in 40 (63%) of the 63 patients, and produced symptoms in 27 (68%) of these 40 patients. Nine (14%) rings were detected radiographically only with a solid bolus; eight of these patients had dysphagia and seven rings were 20 mm or less in caliber. Impaction related to ring caliber, and was found in all 17 (100%) rings that were 13 mm or less in diameter, in 17/24 (71%) 14- to 19-mm rings, and in 6/22 (27%) rings 20 mm or more in caliber. Endoscopy in 23 patients detected 16 (70%) rings, and also depended on ring caliber: less than or equal to 13 mm, 6/6 (100%); 14-19 mm, 5/9 (56%); greater than or equal to 20 mm, 5/8 (63%). Marshmallow impaction occurred in 17 (74%) of 23 patients who had endoscopy; three of the 23 patients had normal endoscopy. In conclusion, radiographic examination supplemented by the use of a marshmallow bolus best detects lower esophageal mucosal ring. 
Role of duplex scanning for the detection of atherosclerotic renal artery disease. To assess the accuracy of renal artery duplex scanning for the purpose of diagnosing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, we compared the findings of renal arteriograms to the results of duplex scanning in 41 patients. Using an increase of renal artery peak systolic flow velocity of greater than 180 cm/sec, duplex scanning was able to discriminate normal from diseased renal arteries with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 90%. Using the principle that blood flow velocity across a stenosis is roughly proportional to the degree of stenosis, it appeared that a ratio of the peak velocity in the renal artery to the aorta (RAR) of greater 3.5 predicted a greater than 60% diameter reduction of that renal artery, which is felt to be a significant stenosis. Forty-eight vessels were classified as having a greater than 60% diameter reduction by arteriography. Using the RAR of greater than 3.5, duplex scanning agreed in 44 renal arteries (sensitivity 92%). In the 26 renal arteries where arteriography showed a less than 60% diameter reduction, duplex scanning agreed in 16 vessels and correctly detected a focal narrowing in nine of the remaining ten vessels. Ten of 11 occluded renal arteries were correctly identified by duplex scanning. Duplex scanning determined the location of the renal artery lesion with an accuracy of 95% (kappa 0.74). Since duplex scanning can accurately demonstrate and locate focal renal artery stenosis, we believe it may become an accurate screening test for renovascular hypertension. 
Histopathological validation of high frequency epicardial echocardiography of the coronary arteries in vitro. The accuracy and reliability of measurement of coronary artery dimensions and detection of atherosclerotic lesions by high frequency epicardial echocardiography were compared with histopathological results. Ten pressure perfused human hearts were examined in vitro with a 10 MHz (Diasonics) transducer and a 7.5 MHz (Vingmed/Sonotron) transducer. There was close agreement between ultrasound and pathological measurements of coronary artery luminal diameter. Qualitative changes in wall structure such as diffuse wall thickening and calcification were readily identified; however, the resolution of the transducers was not high enough accurately to measure wall dimensions in normal coronary arteries. Coefficient of variation measurements for intra and inter observer variability (5.2% and 6.9% respectively) showed excellent reproducibility. The technique was accurate in identifying atherosclerotic lesions, imaging arteries distal to an occlusion, locating deeply sited arteries, and identifying complete obliteration of an artery. Intraoperative video playback and transducer miniaturisation may minimise problems caused by cardiac movement and restricted access. With these developments intraoperative assessment of coronary artery disease may become a real possibility. 
The natural history of diabetic femoral neuropathy Diabetic femoral neuropathy is an uncommon, unpleasant and sometimes disabling condition, on account of both pain and muscular atrophy, whose long-term prognosis has not previously been documented. We have reviewed a group of 27 patients up to 14 years (median 62 months) after diagnosis; 18 of these were re-examined after an average of nearly 4 years (median 45 months). The condition was more common in non-insulin-dependent diabetics (88 per cent), in men (59 per cent) and in older patients (median age at diagnosis 64 years). The neuropathy was bilateral (10 cases) or unilateral (17 cases); five patients with unilateral neuropathy developed femoral neuropathy on the opposite side, usually within a few weeks of the first episode. Recovery was apparent after 3 months and usually complete by 18 months; only two of the 27 patients had severe relapses. No patients remained disabled, although there were minor residual symptoms and signs in half of the patients (2 cm reduction in thigh circumference and diminished reflexes). The outlook for femoral neuropathy, even in its most severe form, is therefore very good: residual features are demonstrable but do not cause symptoms, and relapses after the first few weeks are very rare. 
Effects of a multidimensional cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program on psychosocial function. The effects of participation in a structured, outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program on psychosocial function after acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery, or both, were evaluated prospectively in 141 patients who were married or living with "a significant other" (89% men, mean [+/- standard deviation] age 63 +/- 9 years old). Forty-one patients who were participants in a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program were compared with 100 patients who did not participate in a formal program. On average, patients in both groups were well educated, older Caucasians who had minimal cardiac dysfunction (New York Heart Association class I or II). Patients in the 2 groups were not different at baseline in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics or in any of the dependent measures of anxiety, depression, psychosocial adjustment to illness or marital adjustment. Six months after initial testing, patients who attended cardiac rehabilitation were significantly less anxious (F[1,139] = 5.09, p = 0.03), less depressed (F[1,139] = 8.39, p = 0.004), had better psychosocial adjustment (F[1,139] = 5.87, p = 0.02), and were more satisfied with their marriages (F[1,139] = 8.6, p = 0.004) than nonparticipants. The findings support the effectiveness of group cardiac rehabilitation for this subgroup of patients in facilitating their psychosocial recovery after an acute cardiac event. 
Plasma norepinephrine concentrations during resuscitation in the dog. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the adrenal glands contribute to the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, by releasing norepinephrine and/or by secreting epinephrine that facilitates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings via stimulation of presynaptic beta receptors. The experiments were performed in adrenalectomized and in sham-operated dogs. In adrenalectomized dogs the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and basic life support (BLS) was markedly smaller than in sham-operated dogs. Intravenous infusion of physiologic doses of epinephrine during BLS in adrenalectomized animals did not influence the plasma norepinephrine concentrations. These data indicate that, as suggested by others, the marked increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during BLS in dogs is mainly of adrenomedullary origin. They also suggest that presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release by epinephrine is not important, but further experiments using higher doses of epinephrine are necessary. 
Defective lymphokine-activated killer cell generation and activity in acute leukemia patients with active disease. In 26 myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemia patients at presentation the capacity to generate interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells effective against the natural killer (NK)-resistant Raji cell line, as well as the susceptibility of the blasts to normal peripheral blood (PB) LAK cells and to autologous LAK effectors was analyzed. The overall PB LAK activity against Raji cells was significantly lower in acute leukemia patients compared with normal controls (mean, 1,473 +/- 971 SD LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 3,340 +/- 1,862; P less than .001). The sensitivity of the blasts to autologous LAK cells was also significantly lower than to normal LAK effectors (517 +/- 593 LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 1,304 +/- 1,066; P less than .01). When the data were analyzed independently, four patterns of behavior could be recognized. The relatively largest group (9 of 26) included patients in whom effective LAK cells could be generated against the Raji line, but in whom the blasts were resistant to autologous PB-LAK effectors while being susceptible to normal LAK cells (defective specific LAK activity). In 5 of 26 cases, an incapacity to generate LAK activity against both allogeneic and autologous target cells was observed (defective LAK generation). In six further cases, the blasts were resistant to both allogeneic and autologous LAK populations, though the latter were effective against the Raji line (resistant blasts). The same defects could also be shown with bone marrow-derived LAK cells. Only in six cases did the leukemic blasts appear susceptible to autologous and allogeneic LAK cells. In four patients the analysis could be repeated at remission, and in three a restoration of the LAK function against the primary blasts was recorded. In the 10 cases studied at relapse, the blasts were resistant to autologous LAK effectors in nine and to normal LAK in seven. These data demonstrate that in most acute leukemia patients with active disease, a defect of the LAK machinery, either a deficient generation of LAK cells or the resistance of the blasts to LAK effectors, may be documented, pointing therefore to a possible contributory role of the LAK system in the control of leukemic cell growth. In view of the frequent normalization of the autologous LAK activity at the time of remission, immunotherapy with IL-2/LAK cells should be primarily aimed to patients with minimal residual disease. 
Pharyngeal pouch carcinoma: two unusual cases. Two patients with carcinomata arising in pharyngeal pouches are reported. In one, the tumour was detected preoperatively by a contrast radiographic study. In the second the lesion was a carcinoma in situ. The English literature is reviewed with reference to these two unusual features. 
Middle ear inflammatory mediators and cochlear function. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been documented in patients with otitis media. Despite a number of clinical and pathologic works dealing with this common problem, animal studies searching for possible relationships between the middle ear inflammation and cochlear function remain insufficient. Bacterial inoculation and ototoxins and inflammatory products in the middle ear cavity cause SNHL in rodents. Human serum albumin placed in the middle ear cavity in chinchillas also produces SNHL, owing to the effects of nonspecific inflammation in the middle ear cavity. Most of the middle ear inflammatory mediators enter the inner ear through the round window route, and alteration of the permeability of the round window membrane plays an important role in causing cochlear dysfunction. Although an immunologic response in the middle ear plays an important role in otitis media, the immunologic response in the inner ear as it relates to middle ear inflammatory mediators requires further study. 
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis in acoustic neuroma surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and associated meningitis are the most common life-threatening complications of surgery for acoustic neuromas. This retrospective study reviews 319 patients who had surgery for 321 acoustic tumors at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, from April 1975 to March 1990. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred after 13.4% of primary tumor operations. Surgical repair was required in 6.2% of all patients; 4.4% needed more than one operation. Meningitis occurred in 5.3% of all patients. These complications were more common in larger tumors and after the combined translabyrinthine middle fossa approach. Transnasopharyngeal eustachian tube obliteration was used to stop recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leaks in two patients. 
Progesterone receptor gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms in human breast tumors. We examined the progesterone receptor (PgR) gene in tissue from both primary human breast tumors and normal placentas, detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) with the restriction endonucleases Pst I/Sst I and HindIII. There was a general agreement of the Pst I and Sst I polymorphisms in any individual tumor, suggesting that they define two alleles in the human PgR locus, one being characterized by a deletion of about 300 base pairs with respect to the other. Both primary human breast tumor specimens (n = 36) and human term placentas (n = 48) displayed similar allele frequencies and typical mendelian distribution of these Pst I/Sst I alleles. The previously reported HindIII PgR RFLP was also investigated in 132 breast tumors. The HindIII PgR gene RFLP did not display typical mendelian distribution in the breast tumors; the factors affecting the HindIII allele frequencies are presently unknown. Neither the HindIII RFLP nor the deletion defined by Pst I and Sst I correlated with PgR expression as determined by a ligand-binding assay, suggesting that neither is related to the heterogeneity of PgR expression seen in breast tumors. 
Destructive lesions in demyelinating disease. Three cases are presented in which clinical and radiological features suggested the diagnosis of glioma but surgical biopsy revealed a demyelinating process, with tissue destruction and cyst formation in two. One patient had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Two had probable acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Treatment with high dose steroids is appropriate when there is clinical or investigative evidence to suggest the presence of demyelinating disease, before deciding on biopsy. 
Transmural distribution of myocardial edema by NMR relaxometry following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. To determine the distribution and extent of myocardial edema resulting from ischemia and reperfusion, seven open-chest dogs underwent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 2 hours (group I), and 10 underwent occlusion for 2 hours and reperfusion for 2 hours (group II). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema. There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01). These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001). Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups. Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium. Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion. We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion. 
Tubal occlusion after inguinal hernia repair. A case report. Midtubal occlusion and infertility occurred subsequent to an inguinal hernia repair. Recognition of the traumatic etiology is important because other causes of midtubal obstruction, such as endometriosis, tuberculosis and adenomatoid tumor of the oviduct, may be considered contraindications to reconstructive surgery. Once recognized, the condition is highly amendable to microsurgical reconstruction. 
Role of fine catheter peritoneal cytology and laparoscopy in the management of acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopy and fine catheter peritoneal cytology (FCPC) have been advocated as aids in the assessment of acute abdominal pain. In all, 411 patients admitted to a district general hospital during a 10-month period were managed using a standard protocol incorporating these techniques. After initial assessment by a surgical registrar, 151 patients were excluded from further progress through the protocol (age less than 16 years, definite diagnosis made or contraindication to FCPC. The remaining 260 patients were placed in one of four management groups: (A) urgent operation (23 patients); (B) 'look and see' (40 patients); (C) 'wait and see' (59 patients); (D) urgent operation not indicated (138 patients). Eighty-eight of 99 patients (88 per cent) in groups B and C, where the need for operation was uncertain, underwent successful FCPC and 39 patients (39 per cent) underwent laparoscopy. In these patients the initial registrar management decision proved to be incorrect in 33 cases (33 per cent), but by following the protocol the number of management errors actually made was reduced to 13 (13 per cent, P less than 0.001). This would have been reduced to 8 per cent if the protocol had not been violated in five patients. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a protocol using FCPC and laparoscopy to improve the management of patients with acute abdominal pain. 
Association between the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and infection with Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi in an endemic typhoid area. Eight cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever were identified during a 4-year period in a cohort of 117 patients who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus in Lima, Peru. Asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and patients with the lymphadenopathy syndrome had a typical clinical presentation and response to therapy. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who were culture positive for Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi presented with fulminant diarrhea and/or colitis; the two patients for whom at least 2 months of follow-up were available relapsed. In our cohort there were 0.06 cases of typhoid or paratyphoid per patient year of observation; this rate is approximately 60 times that in the general population in Lima, and 25 times that in the 15- to 35-year-old age group. Our data indicate that patients who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus are at significantly increased risk for infection with S typhi and S paratyphi, and suggest that the clinical presentation of these diseases in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome differs from that seen immunocompetent hosts. 
The roles of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in the management of pyelocaliceal diverticula. Various combinations of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were used in the treatment of 40 stone-containing caliceal diverticula in 39 patients (16 men and 23 women). Only 1 of 26 patients (4%) treated with ESWL as a single modality became stone-free, although 9 (36%) became asymptomatic. Ten patients undergoing ESWL primarily eventually required percutaneous nephrostolithotomy due to persistence of symptoms and all became stone-free. A total of 14 patients underwent a percutaneous approach as a single modality, and the diverticula in 13 of these patients became stone-free, although 2 patients did have residual parenchymal fragments. Therefore, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) became completely free of stones using the percutaneous approach. All patients managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy became free of symptoms. The complex nature of access during percutaneous nephrostolithotomy favors a 1-stage approach with direct puncture into the stone-containing diverticulum. Simultaneous fulguration of the diverticulum at percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is favored, since all 17 patients in whom this technique was used had complete obliteration of the diverticulum on followup contrast studies. These data suggest that caliceal diverticula should be managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy, since ESWL monotherapy is unlikely to produce a stone-free or symptom-free status. 
Five-year survival for cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus single-agent melphalan in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and optimal debulking surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival in previously untreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with single-agent melphalan in which very few patients underwent optimal debulking surgery (less than 2 cm residual) as compared with the patients treated with Cisplatin-based chemotherapy in which most patients underwent optimal debulking surgery. Significant increases in 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival were noted as we changed from the melphalan trial, in which only 14% underwent optimal debulking surgery, to PAC-H, in which 57% and the PAC trial in which 90%, respectively, underwent optimal debulking surgery. However, for those patients whose tumors were optimally debulked in the three trials, there were no statistically significant differences in median survival, median progression-free survival, 5-year survival, or 5-year progression-free survival in those patients treated with melphalan, PAC-H, or PAC. Without optimal debulking surgery, Cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy offered a small survival advantage. These results are similar to that reported by Gruppo Interregionale Cooperativo Oncologico Ginecologia, in which survival curves were identical for all the subgroups of chemotherapy regimens for those patients with residual disease less than 2 cm at the onset of chemotherapy whether they received (1) cyclophosphamide; (2) cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin; (3) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin; (4) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and hexamethylmelamine; (5) Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide; (6) low-dose Cisplatin; (7) high-dose Cisplatin; or (8) carboplatin. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
In vitro maturation of mononuclear phagocytes and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. In the present report, we have studied the in vitro transition of normal blood monocytes to macrophages by changes in cell morphology, and the expression of surface antigens with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The maturation process was accompanied by notable changes in cell-surface markers in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of cells expressing CD11c, ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and Fc receptor class III increased while the CD4 and CD35 expression was markedly decreased. After demonstrating that in vitro monocytes mature to macrophages in a recognizable manner, we studied the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection at time points representing different stages of cell maturation. The results show that monocyte/macrophages are susceptible to HIV-1 infection at all stages of differentiation. However, the kinetics of virus replication depends on the degree of maturation at the time of infection. Two major patterns of replication were observed: Infection of monocytes resulted in efficient virus production measurable by reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatant, whereas infection of fully differentiated macrophages yielded low but sustained virus release only demonstrable by p24 antigen assay. We were not able to detect differences in the capacity of the virus to infect and replicate in monocyte/macrophages with respect to cellular origin of the virus isolate and whether the viruses were laboratory-adapted strains or low-passaged patient isolates. 
Strategy for management of distal ileal Crohn's disease. We have determined the outcome of a defined policy for the management of distal ileal Crohn's disease using a prospective computer-based analysis of 139 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1988 with a mean follow-up of 10 years. The policy in outline consists of conservative treatment for acute obstructive episodes, resection or strictureplasty for recurrent obstructive episodes, surgical treatment for abscess and fistula formation and specific medical treatment (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy or metronidazole) for symptomatic non-obstructive disease. Twenty-nine patients had a benign course without resection. The remainder were treated surgically at some time but only 28 of these patients had specific treatment before operation. Thirty-three needed more than one resection and five needed more than three surgical procedures. Immediate, early or delayed surgical treatment did not affect the reoperation rates or the long-term outcome. Eleven patients died, ten of causes unrelated to Crohn's disease. Of the 128 living patients, 114 are fit and well, and only two are currently taking specific medication. Fourteen are unwell of whom six either need or have refused further surgery which could restore them to good health. This management policy has achieved excellent long-term results in nearly all patients, and our findings suggest that the timing of surgery and its nature are more important in determining outcome than specific medical therapy. 
Diphenhydramine toxicity in three children with varicella-zoster infection. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties that is frequently used both orally and topically for the temporary relief of pruritus. Significant systemic absorption may occur following topical administration of diphenhydramine in patients with varicella-zoster lesions. We describe three children with varicella-zoster infection (VZI) who developed bizarre behavior as well as visual and auditory hallucinations following topical applications of large amounts of diphenhydramine to the majority of skin surfaces. In two cases, oral diphenhydramine was also administered. Serum diphenhydramine concentrations approximated or exceeded those previously reported. In each case, a complete resolution of mental status abnormalities occurred within 24 hours after discontinuation of all diphenhydramine-containing products. Pharmacists and other health professionals should be aware of the potential toxicity of topical diphenhydramine in patients with VZI. 
Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases. The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma. Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies. Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy. Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed. 
Posterior cricoarytenoid activity in normal adults during involuntary and voluntary hyperventilation. The effect of isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia on the electrical activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle was determined in eight normal adult humans by use of standard rebreathing techniques and was compared with PCA activity during voluntary hyperventilation performed under isocapnic and hypocapnic conditions. PCA activity was recorded with intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes implanted through a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope. During quiet breathing in all subjects, the PCA was phasically active on inspiration and tonically active throughout the respiratory cycle. At comparable increments in respiratory output, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and voluntary hyperventilation appeared to be associated with similar increases in phasic or tonic PCA activity. During quiet breathing, the onset of phasic PCA activity usually occurred before inspiratory airflow and extended beyond the start of expiratory airflow. The duration of phasic PCA preactivation and postinspiratory phasic PCA activity remained unchanged during progressive hypercapnia and progressive hypoxia. The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors, suggest that vocal cord position throughout the respiratory cycle during hyperpnea is actively controlled by simultaneously acting and antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles. 
Isolated cryptococcosis of the adrenal gland. A case of isolated adrenal cryptococcosis is reported. A patient with a history of diabetes mellitus had symptoms of left flank pain. Roentgenological and sonographic findings of the adrenal gland were indicative of a malignant tumour. Tissue obtained from surgery showed fungal granuloma and a poorly encapsulated cryptococcal organism was identified by special stains. A post-operative serum cryptococcal antigen test was positive, and the patient was successfully treated with surgery and a course of amphotericin B. After a 7-month follow-up period, there is no evidence of recurrence or dissemination. 
Dexamethasone therapy in neonatal chronic lung disease: an international placebo-controlled trial. Collaborative Dexamethasone Trial Group. In a multicenter trial of steroid therapy for chronic neonatal oxygen dependence, 287 neonates were randomly allocated from around 3 weeks of age, to dexamethasone or placebo. Active treatment significantly reduced the duration of further assisted ventilation among infants who were ventilator dependent at entry (median days for survivors, 11 vs 17.5). There were no statistically significant differences between the total groups of survivors in time receiving supplemental oxygen and length of stay in hospital, although the trend favored the dexamethasone group. Twenty-five infants in each group died prior to hospital discharge; most were ventilator dependent at trial entry. Open treatment with steroids was later given to 18% in the active group and to 43% in the placebo group. There was no evidence of serious side effects; in particular, infection rates were similar in the two groups. 
Hemodynamic consequences of desmopressin administration after cardiopulmonary bypass. Desmopressin acetate is used to reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery. However, there have been reports that hypotension can occur with infusion of desmopressin and that postoperative blood loss is not reduced. In this randomized, double-blinded study, we investigated the effects of desmopressin on hemodynamics, coagulation, and postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After reversal of heparin effect, 20 patients received desmopressin 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, infused over 15 min, and 20 patients received a placebo. Desmopressin produced a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo (50.8 mmHg vs. 57.6 mmHg for the desmopressin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; P = 0.0372). A 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in 7 of 20 patients receiving desmopressin, whereas only one patient in the placebo-treated group experienced a decrease of this magnitude (P = 0.0177). Reductions in arterial pressure were secondary to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (mean SVR before and after the drug infusion, 1,006 and 766 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the desmopressin-treated group; and 994 and 1,104 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the placebo-treated group; P = 0.0078). 
Cutaneous metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Cutaneous metastases from carcinoma of the thyroid gland are rare. We present the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of a solitary metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Our results indicate that this tumor can produce epithelial mucin and, therefore, must be differentiated from other metastatic carcinomas and from primary apocrine tumors of the skin. Positive staining for thyroglobulin confirmed the diagnosis in this case. 
Fibrous lesions of the gingiva: a histopathologic analysis of 204 cases. Two hundred four cases of fibrous lesions of the gingiva were studied histologically for the presence of calcified tissue, the nature of the connective tissue, the type of keratinization, and the degree of epithelial thickness. Initially these lesions were subcategorized into four specific entities, namely fibrous epulis, fibroepithelial polyp, calcifying fibroblastic granuloma, and ossifying fibrous epulis. It was found that 46.5% of the lesions contained calcifications. The connective tissue was represented predominantly by either the collagenous type (50.5%) or the mixed (cellular and collagenous) type (44.6%). It was also found that 36% of the lesions were ulcerated, and, of these, 79.5% were associated with the cellular type of connective tissue and calcifications. In an attempt to subcategorize the fibrous lesions into specific entities, it was found that 32 cases (15.7%) had mixed features. This fact supports the suggestion that these lesions are stages in the spectrum of a single disease process and should collectively be termed fibroblastic gingival lesions. However, it is also suggested that the two terms, namely peripheral fibroma and fibrous epulis with and without ossification, should be retained whereas the usage of other terminologies should be avoided. 
Significance of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence after lumpectomy. Breast cancer treatment trials from the US National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project have established breast-conserving operations as a replacement for radical mastectomy (NSABP B-04), and have shown that in terms of survival free from distant disease there was no significant difference between lumpectomy, lumpectomy plus breast irradiation, and total mastectomy (NSABP B-06). 9-year follow-up data from B-06 are used here to address the issue of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) and the development of distant disease, a question with important clinical and biological implications. A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis. While mastectomy or breast irradiation following lumpectomy prevent expression of the marker they do not lower the risk of distant disease. These findings further justify the use of lumpectomy. 
Prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the Parsi community of Bombay. We carried out a door-to-door survey to screen for neurologic diseases, including peripheral neuropathy, in a community of 14,010 Parsis living in housing colonies in Bombay, India. The most common neurologic disorder was peripheral neuropathy with 334 cases (2,384 cases/100,000 population). The most common neuropathy was compressive, with diabetes the most common noncompressive etiology. There was no leprosy, and nutritional neuropathies were rare. 
A pilot study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin with surgical resection and postoperative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Fifteen patients with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were treated with two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (DDP). Response to chemotherapy was evaluated by comparative barium swallow, computerized chest tomography, esophagoscopy, and change in clinical symptomatology. Eleven patients (73%) were resected, two (13%) were explored and found inoperable, and two (13%) were not subjected to surgery (one because of death related to toxicity and one due to progressive disease). Ten of eleven patients (91%) had gross residual tumor. One patient (9%) had residual microscopic disease only. One patient (7%) had complete clinical responses (CCR), five (33%) had partial clinical response (PCR), and nine (60%) had no response (NR). Five of 15 patients (or 45% of resected patients) remain free of disease. Median survival time was 18.47 months for all patients and 23.83 months for resected patients. 
Duodenobronchial fistula. Duodenobronchial fistulas are an extremely rare subgroup of abdominobronchial fistulas, which include bronchobiliary, gastrobronchial, enterobronchial, colobronchial, and splenobronchial fistulas. Only one case of a duodenobronchial fistula has been previously reported. Duodenobronchial fistulas occur as a complication of a duodenal injury. The characteristic symptoms are a cough that produces copious bilious secretions, shortness of breath, and fever. The diagnosis is made by contrast gastrointestinal studies. Treatment requires an abdominal approach with interruption of the fistula at its duodenal origin and control of the inciting inflammatory process. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, thoracic drainage or pulmonary resection should not be needed. 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia discovered at coronary bypass operation. A 68-year-old man was discovered to have a large peritoneopericardial hernia when operated on for coronary artery bypass. Such hernias are very unusual. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of this problem are discussed. 
Acute necrotizing pancreatitis: management by planned, staged pancreatic necrosectomy/debridement and delayed primary wound closure over drains. We reviewed our recent experience with management of 23 consecutive patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. All patients had documented necrotizing pancreatitis with parenchymal or peripancreatic necrosis. Our method of treatment has evolved from our previous approach of controlled open lesser sac drainage (marsupialization) to staged necrosectomy/debridement with delayed primary closure over drains. With this latter approach, hospital mortality was 4 of 23 patients (17 per cent), but significant morbidity still occurred in 12 of 23 patients (52 per cent). However, recurrent intra-abdominal abscess before discharge occurred in only one patient. We believe that this operative approach toward the severely ill patient with acute necrotizing pancreatitis who requires operative intervention will minimize the occurrence of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
CT of the pancreas in children. CT has become a frequently used imaging method for evaluating suspected pancreatic disease in children. Although the spectrum of CT findings in pancreatic disease is well documented in adults, there is a paucity of such information in children. Familiarity with CT patterns of pancreatic disease in childhood is important for diagnosis. In this essay, we illustrate the CT findings of pancreatic lesions in children. 
Pectus excavatum: a 15-year perspective. Pectus excavatum is relatively uncommon. Our experience with 177 children during a 15-year period produced changes in our surgical technique, which now includes a small transverse incision, minimal subcutaneous flap elevation, a muscle-relaxing incision over the fifth costal cartilage, complete resection of involved cartilage, use of Adkins' strut, suspension of sternum to strut, taut reefing of intercostal muscle, no tubes or drains, epidural analgesia, a patient-controlled analgesia device postoperatively, and eventual strut removal. Use of the evolved technique gives excellent cosmetic results, good functional results with minimal discomfort, and a shorter convalescent period. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Hypercarbic acidosis reduces cardiac resuscitability. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Marked increases in myocardial hypercarbia and acidosis accompany cardiac arrest and resuscitation. To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5. After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted. RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated. However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001). This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR. 
Endoscopic balloon dilatation as a therapeutic option in the management of intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was undertaken in seven patients who presented with obstructive symptoms resulting from Crohn's disease. Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture. The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated. Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery. 
Definitive diagnosis of breast implant rupture by ultrasonography. Silicone breast implantation is entering its fourth decade. Our ability to monitor the integrity of "old" prostheses is questioned. Clinical and mammographic examinations are reliable indicators of implant rupture only if there has been gel migration away from the implant pocket. Ultrasonography is presented as a reliable, sensitive method of evaluation of implant integrity. It should be considered the definitive study of prosthesis integrity. When sonography is added to mammographic and clinical examination, the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic augmented breasts is complete. Ultrasonography may be considered with mammography in the routine breast examination of all previously augmented patients. 
External fistulas arising from the digestive tract. External abdominal fistulas that arise from the digestive tract are associated with high mortality and prolonged morbidity in terms of infection, malnutrition, and skin excoriation. Such external fistulas most commonly follow anastomotic leak after gastrointestinal surgery. We identified 58 patients seen over a 5-year period at the University of Louisville Hospitals because of external abdominal fistulas that arose from the stomach (8), duodenum (4), small intestine (26), colon (14), biliary tract (9), and pancreas (7). Fifteen patients had multiple fistulas and 32 had high-output fistulas (greater than 200 mL/day). Closure was achieved in 48 patients, and eight of the 10 patients whose fistulas remained open died. Overall mortality was 19%. Principles of management include control of infection, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nutritional support, proper wound care, and often operative intervention. Multiple staged operations over many months were particularly important in managing complex wounds with large abdominal wall defects and multiple fistulas. Fistula closure is the ultimate goal, and patience is important to achieve it. 
Neurogenic pulmonary edema: treatment with dobutamine. In the case of a patient with complicating subarachnoid hemorrhage, an infusion of dobutamine was followed by a massive diuresis and regression of severe neurogenic pulmonary edema. It is suggested that the reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance and the increase in cardiac contractility accounts for the observed beneficial effect and indicate that dobutamine is a suitable drug for the treatment of neurogenic pulmonary edema. 
Rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis following intravenous vasopressin infusion. A continuous IV infusion of vasopressin was administrated to a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices. In the first 24 hours, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis. Stopping vasopressin infusion resulted in relief of these lesions. The rarity of these complications suggests an idiosyncratic reaction of susceptible individuals that may be related to previous vascular disease or a failure in baroreceptor regulation. 
Health benefits of aerobic exercise. Regular aerobic exercise has significant cardiovascular benefits, including a reduction in incidence of and mortality from coronary artery disease--probably because of positive effects on blood lipid levels and blood pressure. Aerobic exercise can also be an important adjunct to a weight-loss program. Many persons who continue an exercise program do so because of its positive mental benefits, including reduction in anxiety and depression and modulation of stress levels. Aerobic exercise has a place in the management of diabetes, pregnancy, and aging. The problems associated with aerobic exercise are minimal compared with its benefits. 
Low back pain: review of diagnosis and therapy. Low back pain is a patient complaint frequently encountered in the emergency department setting. The disease entity is often a diagnostic challenge with a subtle presentation, but can be accompanied by significant neurovascular complications. Current topics of controversy include the utility of radiologic evaluation, pharmacologic and holistic treatment strategies, as well as guidelines for urgent referral of patients with lumbar pain. 
Color Doppler imaging provides accurate assessment of orbital blood flow in occlusive carotid artery disease. Color Doppler imaging was used to evaluate the hemodynamics of the ophthalmic vasculature in a case of complete internal carotid artery occlusion. This procedure, which allows rapid, noninvasive imaging, showed a partial ophthalmic artery obstruction with absent flow in the central retinal artery, central retinal vein, and nasal posterior ciliary arteries. Although altered perfusion of the retinal vessels may be evaluated clinically, assessment of blood flow in the ophthalmic and ciliary arteries previously could be evaluated only indirectly by intravenous fluorescein angiography. The color Doppler imaging findings were confirmed by intravenous fluorescein angiography and carotid arteriography. Color Doppler imaging represents a noninvasive method to diagnose abnormal blood flow of the ophthalmic artery and its branches and to evaluate serial changes of the circulation in a noninvasive manner. 
Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. 
Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors: their occurrence sporadically and in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) often occur on dorsal nerve roots sporadically or in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. These are histologically benign tumors, and distinction between them is frequently not made by clinicians. To determine if there is a correlation between the histological pattern of benign spinal nerve sheath tumors and the type of neurofibromatosis, the clinical and pathological features of these tumors (86 surgical specimens and five autopsies) in 68 patients were reviewed. The patients were classified into one of four categories: neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, uncertain, or sporadic. The diagnostic criteria used for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were established by the National Institutes of Health. Patients who did not fulfill criteria for either neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 but who had multiple nervous system tumors or other stigmata of neurofibromatosis were designated "uncertain." Spinal nerve sheath tumors were considered sporadic in 42 cases (40 schwannomas and two neurofibromas). In the 14 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were neurofibromas. In six of the seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were schwannomas. One patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 had a spinal nerve sheath schwannoma and a tumor with features of both tumor types. The authors conclude that spinal nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are neurofibromas. In contrast, spinal nerve sheath tumors occurring in neurofibromatosis type 2 or sporadically are most frequently schwannomas. The distinct histological features of these tumors may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms even though they arise at identical sites in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. 
The effect of decompression on the natural course of spinal stenosis. A comparison of surgically treated and untreated patients. The clinical course of 19 untreated patients with spinal stenosis (mean age, 60 years) was compared with that of 44 patients treated surgically (mean age, 65 years). The time of follow-up was 31 and 53 months, respectively. About 80% of the patients had neurogenic intermittent claudication. In the follow-up, one third of the treated and one half of the untreated patients still had neurogenic claudication. By visual analogue-scale estimation, 60% of those treated surgically and 33% of the untreated patients felt better. Fifty-eight percent of the untreated patients were unchanged. Neurophysiologic changes showed progression in almost all cases; it was more pronounced in the treated patients. No proof of severe deterioration was found in the untreated patients, and observation for 2-3 years seems to be a good alternative to surgery. 
Continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in acute brain injury: injection of mannitol during hyperventilation. Global cerebral oxygenation, perfusion pressure, and expired pCO2 were continuously monitored in 10 adults with acute severe closed head trauma. Cerebral oxygenation was monitored by fiberoptic catheter oximetry, which allowed simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation. Intracranial pressure levels over 20 mm Hg were recorded several times in all patients, in spite of sedation, muscle paralysis, and profound hyperventilation. Intracranial hypertension was frequently associated with oligemic cerebral hypoxia, identified as abnormally low jugular oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation. Intracranial hypertension was then managed with intravenous administration of mannitol boluses, which yielded simultaneous decreases in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral oxygenation to highly statistically significant levels. Monitoring cerebral oxygenation was clinically useful because it allowed identification of impaired cerebral oxygenation even when cerebral perfusion pressure was normal. It is therefore proposed as a new monitoring technique, to supplement conventional monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure. 
Chronic central nervous system effects of acute organophosphate pesticide intoxication. The Pesticide Health Effects Study Group. Acute organophosphate pesticide poisonings cause substantial morbidity and mortality world wide; however, whether organophosphates cause chronic neurological sequelae has not been established. To see whether single episodes of acute unintentional organophosphate intoxication lead to chronic neuropsychological dysfunction, we carried out a retrospective study of agricultural workers in Nicaragua who had been admitted to hospital between July 1, 1986, and July 31, 1988, for occupationally related organophosphate intoxication. This "poisoned" group (36 men) was tested on average about two years after the episode of pesticide poisoning and compared with a matched control group. The poisoned group did much worse than the control group on all neuropsychological subtests, with significantly worse performance on five of six subtests of a World Health Organisation neuropsychological test battery and on 3 of 6 additional tests that assessed verbal and visual attention, visual memory, visuomotor speed, sequencing and problem solving, and motor steadiness and dexterity. Differences in neuropsychological performance could not be explained by other factors. The findings of a persistent decrease in neuropsychological performance among individuals with previous intoxication emphasise the importance of prevention of even single episodes of organophosphate poisoning. 
Preoperative and intraoperative fine needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic lesions. The aim of the present study was to describe our experience from 1976 through 1988 with fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 90 patients. Fine needle aspirations were performed preoperatively under ultrasound guidance (USG) in 46 patients, under computed tomographic guidance (CTG) in seven patients, and intraoperatively in 37 patients. Based on histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings, final diagnoses were reached in 80 patients, of whom 62 had malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) and 18 had benign pancreatic disease (BPD). The accuracy of cytologic diagnoses was verified by histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings. In 62 patients with MPD, the cytologic findings suggested malignancy in 54 patients, suspected malignancy in five, and did not reveal malignancy in three patients. Among 18 patients with BPD, all of the cytologic findings were reported as benign. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy for intraoperative FNA cytologic results were 96%, 100%, 100%, 91%, and 97%, respectively, and for USG FNA cytologic results were 94%, 100%, 100%, 78%, and 95%, respectively. No complications followed the procedure. Conclusions: Both transabdominal percutaneous imaging-guided and intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions are simple, safe, and highly accurate methods in differentiation of benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. 
Stress erosive gastritis. Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade. The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology. This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers). A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal. In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients. In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice. Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention. 
Autonomic function in Friedreich's ataxia. Autonomic function studies were performed on 15 patients with Friedreich's ataxia, and the results compared with those of 76 healthy subjects. There was an increase in resting supine heart rate, attributed to cardiac abnormalities. Other tests of sympathetic and parasympathetic function were normal. The normal autonomic function studies are consistent with the pathological findings of degeneration predominantly of large diameter myelinated fibres with sparing of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres. 
Tracheostomal stenosis after immediate tracheoesophageal puncture. The incidence of tracheostomal stenosis in a group of patients after total laryngectomy with or without pharyngectomy plus immediate tracheoesophageal or tracheogastric puncture was compared with that of a control group without puncture. The stenosis rate of the puncture group was significantly higher than that of the control group (19% vs 6%). The other probable etiologic factors for stomal stricture were similar in both groups. Analysis of the risk factors in the puncture group suggested a higher tendency of stenosis in females (43% vs 16%) and in patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (29% vs 14%), although the difference failed to reach statistical significance. 
Prevention of stroke by antihypertensive drug treatment in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension. Final results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). SHEP Cooperative Research Group OBJECTIVE.--To assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN.--Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. SETTING.--Community-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS.--4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black. INTERVENTIONS.--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Primary.--Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary.--Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. RESULTS.--Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. CONCLUSION.--In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000. 
A randomized clinical trial of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin versus cefotaxime and clindamycin in children with ruptured appendicitis. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin (AGC) or cefotaxime and clindamycin (CC) for the treatment of children with complicated appendicitis. Ninety-seven children were randomized. Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC. Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS). There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization. Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint. We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy. 
The clinical diagnosis of splenomegaly. Assessing for the presence of splenomegaly is an important component of the physical examination. Although several methods of palpation and percussion of the spleen have been described, until recently they have not been validated by noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, and computed tomography that offer objective means to assess splenomegaly. We review the literature comparing various physical examination techniques with noninvasive imaging modalities and conclude that palpation and percussion of the spleen are complementary but frequently insensitive and that further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of specific diagnostic methods. 
The failed ulnar nerve transposition. Etiology and treatment. Various procedures have been recommended for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. Simple decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, subcutaneous transposition, intramuscular transposition, and submuscular transposition all have their advocates. The results of the surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome are related to the severity of the compressive neuropathy at the time of diagnosis and to the adequate decompression of the nerve at all sites of potential compression at the time of surgical treatment. Fourteen patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated because of persistent pain, paresthesia, numbness, and motor weakness. All patients had documented persistent compression of the ulnar nerve on clinical and electromyographic evaluation. The indication for repeat surgical exploration in all patients was unremitting pain despite nonoperative treatment. All patients had been treated by neurolysis and submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve as described by Learmonth. The causes of continued pain after initial surgery included retention of the medial intermuscular septum, dense perineural fibrosis of the nerve after intramuscular and subcutaneous transposition, adhesions of the nerve to the medial epicondylectomy site, and recurrent subluxation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle after subcutaneous transposition. Revision surgery was found to be highly successful for relief of pain and paresthesias; however, the recovery of motor function and return of sensibility were variable and unpredictable. 
Role of calcium channel blockers in protection against experimental renal injury. The available evidence indicates that the first generation calcium channel blocker verapamil has a protective effect against both acute and chronic renal failure. At the cell membrane, verapamil helps minimize the effects of excess calcium influx after ischemic injury, evidenced by reduced uptake of 45Ca, thus lessening tubular injury from both calcium-activated phospholipases and mitochondrial calcium overload. In experimental chronic renal failure, the long-term administration of verapamil protects against renal dysfunction and damage, independent of any effect on systemic mean arterial pressure. Protective effects of verapamil are delineated in several models, supporting the presented hypothesis of the pathogenesis of renal failure. 
Clinical significance of small-intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV-1-infected individuals To assess the importance of microsporidiosis of the small intestine in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals, duodenal biopsy samples from the following three patient groups were prospectively evaluated for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens by standard methods, and for microsporidia by light microscopy: 55 consecutive HIV-1-antibody-positive subjects with unexplained diarrhoea of at least 3 weeks duration (group A); 38 HIV-1-seropositive subjects without diarrhoea (group B) who consecutively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various reasons; and 7 patients without known risk factors for HIV infection with chronic unexplained diarrhoea (group C). In groups A and B most subjects had had previous AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and the median peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. Microsporidia were detected as the single pathogen in 15 of the group A compared with 1 (in whom diarrhoea subsequently developed) of the group B patients (p = 0.001) and none of the group C patients. With the exception of 4 of the group A patients, no other intestinal pathogens were identified in any of the patients. The median peripheral blood CD4 count was significantly lower in patients with detectable microsporidia than in those without microsporidiosis (0.03 x 10(9)/l vs 0.06 x 10(9)/l; p = 0.03); in all patients with microsporidiosis, the CD4 count was equal to or less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. 13 patients with microsporidiosis were treated with metronidazole, in 10 of whom treatment led to a substantial improvement or disappearance of diarrhoea within days of starting therapy, but did not result in eradication of the parasite in the 5 patients who underwent repeat biopsy. The findings suggest that small-intestinal microsporidiosis is an important cause of chronic unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals with pronounced cellular immune deficiency. This infection should therefore be added to the list of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections. 
Differences in vascular reactivity in models of ischemic acute renal failure. To determine the mechanism of observed differences in vasoreactivity in norepinephrine-induced (NE) and renal artery clamp (RAC) models of ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), induction renal blood flow (RBF) was measured and vascular reactivity examined one week thereafter in NE- and RAC-ARF rat kidneys that had identical levels of renal dysfunction. Morphology also was compared at 48 hours and one week. In NE-ARF, RBF was 14% during 90 minutes of induction and by 60 minutes post-NE infusion was only 18% of baseline. In contrast, in RAC-ARF RBF was effectively 0 for 75 minutes but returned to 95% of baseline by 60 minutes after clamp release. At one week there was a paradoxical increase in renovascular resistance (RVR) to renal perfusion pressure (RPP) reduction in the autoregulatory range and an augmented vasoconstriction to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) in NE-ARF, but no change in RVR and minimal reduction in RBF to these same respective stimuli in RAC-ARF (both different at P less than 0.001). NE-ARF were more sensitive to intrarenal norepinephrine than RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Neither NE- nor RAC-ARF kidneys responded to endothelium-dependent acetylcholine (ACh). Vasodilation to endothelium-independent prostacyclin (PGI2) in NE- was similar to sham-ARF, but there was an attenuated response in RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Morphology at 48 hours showed smooth muscle necrosis in half of the resistance vessels in RAC- but in less than 10% of those in NE-ARF. Except for a slightly greater frequency of tubular casts at 48 hours in RAC-ARF, tubular injury was indistinguishable. It is concluded that NE-ARF has evidence of a predominant functional endothelial vascular injury while RAC-ARF has both morphologic and functional evidence of a predominant smooth muscle injury. Differences in vascular injury between the two models, at least in part, may be the consequence of differences in severity of initial ischemia and/or the rates of recovery of RBF; however, an additional or separate toxic effect of infused NE cannot be excluded. 
S100 protein-positive sustentacular cells in malignant and locally aggressive adrenal pheochromocytomas. The absence or presence of S100-positive sustentacular cells has been previously shown to be correlated with benign and malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We evaluated a total of 17 malignant and recurrent or locally aggressive adrenal pheochromocytomas for their quantity of sustentacular cells. An absence of sustentacular cells was demonstrated in the majority of malignant cases, while the locally aggressive or recurrent group usually contained an abundance of these cells. However, in one malignant case a constant moderate number of sustentacular cells in the primary site and in two sequential metastases was found. We conclude that the absence of sustentacular cells in pheochromocytomas may indicate a lesion with a greater potential for metastasis and that sustentacular cells, when they are present in a malignant pheochromocytoma, are an integral part of the tumor. 
Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy for malignant glaucoma following one-piece 7 mm intraocular lens implantation. Three cases of malignant glaucoma following extracapsular cataract extraction with 7 mm one-piece posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation are presented. Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy was successfully performed in all eyes, but was difficult and required several sessions in two eyes. In the third eye, which had a sector iridectomy, laser hyaloidotomy applied over the edge of the lens optic through the iridectomy resulted in brisk deepening of the anterior chamber and reduction of intraocular pressure. We propose that the one-piece 7 mm optic posterior chamber intraocular lens may constitute an obstacle to successful hyaloidotomy, mainly owing to its large size, as it may block aqueous percolation from the vitreous into the anterior chamber. Eyes prone to develop malignant glaucoma after surgery should have a sector or large peripheral iridectomy to facilitate postoperative Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy if required. 
Emergency pulmonary resection for pneumonia. High morbidity and mortality. Emergency pulmonary resection was performed because of complicated pneumonia in eight patients (5 pneumonectomies, 2 lobectomies, 1 bilobectomy) over a 2-year period. The patients' age range was 5 months to 43 years. The indications were rapid aggravation of respiratory insufficiency in children with staphylococcal pneumonia and enlarging pneumatoceles, and massive hemoptysis in patients with chronic destructive pneumonia. Two patients died after pneumonectomy, one from contralateral aspiration and one from cardiogenic shock. Postoperative complications occurred in four cases--bronchopleural fistula and pyopneumothorax in three and thoracic empyema with massive chest-wall infection in one. Only two patients had an uneventful postoperative course. Complications of pulmonary necrosis in pneumonia may dictate urgent pulmonary resection, often pneumonectomy. Surgery will be life-saving in most cases, but high morbidity is to be expected. 
Myocardial rupture. Your patient's survival may depend on you. Myocardial rupture is the second leading cause of in-hospital death from acute myocardial infarction. It is most likely to occur in the elderly, women, and patients with transmural infarction and no previous history of angina. A high index of suspicion is critical to the diagnosis. Myocardial rupture should be suspected when recurrent chest pain or hemodynamic instability develops after myocardial infarction. Rapid intervention and appropriate infarct-limiting therapy may reduce the mortality rate of this catastrophic complication. 
Abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess associated with an intrauterine device. A case report. An abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess occurred in a woman with an intrauterine device. Contributing factors were local trauma, spread from surrounding colonized body sites and symbiotic growth of other anaerobes. The diagnosis was based on the histologic finding of the sulfur granule. Special studies may be needed to distinguish this condition from other, similar ones (Nocardia, botryomycosis). 
Radionuclide assessment of ventricular function and risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Prognosis after acute myocardial infarction is determined primarily by left ventricular function and by the extent to which additional coronary obstructions jeopardize viable myocardium. Radionuclide ventriculography is well suited for noninvasive assessments of resting and exercise ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. The prognostic importance of resting left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction is well established. Several studies have reported the prognostic utility of submaximal exercise radionuclide ventriculography at the time of hospital discharge. Patients with globally depressed left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction are at increased risk for cardiac death, while patients with normal resting ventricular function but abnormal function during exercise appear to be at risk for nonfatal ischemic events. The development of gated tomographic techniques and new radiopharmaceuticals will make available more accurate and detailed assessments of ventricular function and combined assessments of function and perfusion. These new developments require further investigation but appear to be promising new techniques with the potential for providing improved assessments of prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage after lumbar myelography with iohexol: report of a case and review of the literature. Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon complication of dural puncture. In most instances, hematomas are subdural; they may be unilateral or bilateral. Rarely are intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhages related to dural puncture. This report describes a delayed occurrence of bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages in a 38-year-old woman 7 days after lumbar myelography with iohexol. A review of the literature is presented. 
Is the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease relationship modified by activity level in older persons? Although coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of death and disability in old age, the relationship of serum cholesterol level to risk of coronary heart disease in old age is controversial. Data for 2,388 white persons aged 65-74 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) were examined to determine the relationship of serum cholesterol level to coronary heart disease incidence and whether activity level would modify this relationship. While there was no overall relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease risk in either men or women, the relationship between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease differed within activity groups. For persons who were more active, serum cholesterol level was associated with a graded increase in risk of coronary heart disease, from 1.3 (95% CI 0.7, 2.3) in those with serum cholesterol level of 4.7-5.1 to 1.7 in those with serum cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or more (95% CI 1.0, 2.7), when compared with those with serum cholesterol level below 4.7. For the least active persons, all levels of cholesterol were associated with a significant inverse relative risk, including cholesterol of 6.2 mmol/L or more (Relative risk = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2, 0.7]. These data suggest that factors such as activity level may modify the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in old age. The serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association in more active older persons resembles that seen in younger populations, whereas the association in less active persons is that of serum cholesterol level and risk of cancer or death. The modification of the serum cholesterol-coronary heart disease association by activity level may have implications for appropriate clinical management as well as appropriate design of research studies of this association. 
Elevated brain concentrations of 1,4-benzodiazepines in fulminant hepatic failure BACKGROUND. Increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The mechanism by which GABA-ergic activity is increased in hepatic failure is unclear, but recent studies in animals with encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure suggest that GABA-ergic neurotransmission may be increased by the presence of elevated concentrations of benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. METHODS AND RESULTS. Samples of frontal cortex were obtained at autopsy from 11 patients with hepatic encephalopathy who died of acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients who died of cardiovascular disease or trauma. None of the 19 patients had received benzodiazepines while hospitalized. Chromatographic analyses of extracts of these samples revealed 4 to 19 peaks representing substances that inhibited the binding of a radiolabeled imidazobenzodiazepine ([3H]flumazenil) to its receptors. Several of these peaks had retention times corresponding to those of known 1,4-benzodiazepines. Ultraviolet- and mass-spectroscopic analysis confirmed that two of these peaks represented diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. The patients who died of fulminant hepatic failure could be divided into two groups: six who had had significantly elevated brain concentrations (2-fold to 10-fold higher than normal) of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil and five who had normal concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Brain concentrations of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil to its receptors are increased in some patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure. The origin of these substances is unknown, but these findings provide a rational basis for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists in the management of this disorder. 
Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in paraffin-embedded liver tissues in chronic hepatitis B or non-A, non-B, hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. We developed a polymerase chain reaction assay for the direct detection of hepatitis B virus in paraffin-embedded liver tissue and applied this assay to determine whether hepatitis B virus DNA exists in livers with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B. Fifty five liver biopsy samples were studied: 11 from patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis (paraffin-embedded) and 44 from patients with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B (21 paraffin-embedded; 25 fresh frozen). Thirty three (75%) of the non-A, non-B cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Approximately 1 to 10 ng of DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified using oligonucleotide (23-mer) primers specific for the S gene (positions 261 to 692). The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control for sensitivity because this is a single copy gene and allows for relative quantification. In each of the chronic hepatitis B livers, the expected 432-base-pair amplification product for hepatitis B virus DNA and beta-globin gene product were both detected. On the other hand, in the 21 paraffin-embedded chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B livers, no hepatitis B virus DNA was detected, although beta-globin gene was observed in all. Furthermore, in all 25 frozen non-A, non-B livers, beta-globin gene was observed, but no hepatitis B virus band was seen. The limit of detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by this method was estimated to be one genomic copy of hepatitis B virus DNA per cell. 
Ovulation induction by step-down administration of purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The step-down method can be an alternative method of ovulation induction in women with PCOS. This protocol can induce ovulation with a smaller dose of FSH and with lower incidence of excessive ovarian enlargement in comparison with the traditional fixed-dose administration method. 
Fluoxetine in the treatment of borderline and schizotypal personality disorders. Twenty-two patients meeting the criteria for borderline or schizotypal personality disorder or both participated in a prospective, nonblind 12-week trial of fluoxetine. There were significant reductions in self-injury and in scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist regardless of diagnosis. The results suggest that controlled trials of fluoxetine and investigations of the serotonergic system in these disorders would be useful. 
Atypical polypoid dermatofibroma: report of two cases. Two cases of a hitherto undescribed special variant of dermatofibroma are reported. A man and a woman, aged 57 and 52 years, respectively, had slowly growing cutaneous tumors on the lower extremities. The tumors were exophytic and polypoid, 10 and 6 cm in maximal diameters, respectively; they were covered by rough nonulcerated skin and were joined by a short pedicle to an indurated base. Histologic examination showed some features of an otherwise conventional dermatofibroma, whereas the polypoid component was hypercellular and showed striking atypia and scattered mitotic figures. After 32 and 28 months' follow-up, the lesions did not recur after surgical excision. We suggest the term atypical polypoid dermatofibroma to summarize the special clinicopathologic features of these tumors. 
Pelvic fracture from major blunt trauma. Outcome is determined by associated injuries. Pelvic hemorrhage has been implicated as the cause of death in 50% of patients who die following pelvic fractures. To establish correlates of morbidity and mortality from pelvic fractures due to blunt trauma, we reviewed 236 patients treated during 4 years. The average age of the 144 men and 92 women was 31.5 years, the average Injury Severity Score was 21.3, the average blood requirement was 5 units, and the average hospital stay was 16.8 days. One hundred fifty-two patients (64.4%) were injured in motor vehicle accidents, 33 (14%) had motor vehicle-pedestrian accidents, 16 (6.8%) had crush injuries, 12 (5.1%) each had either motorcycle accidents or falls, and 11 (4.6%) had miscellaneous accidents. Eighteen patients (7.6%) died, with seven (38.9%) deaths due to hemorrhage. Only one death was caused by pelvic hemorrhage. Other deaths were due to hemorrhage from other sites (6), head injury (5), sepsis or multiple-organ failure (4), pulmonary injury (1), and pulmonary embolus (1). None of the septic deaths was related to a pelvic hematoma. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that the severity of injury was correlated with indices of severity of pelvic fractures such as fracture site (p less than 0.0001), fracture displacement (p less than 0.005), pelvic stability (p less than 0.0001), and vector of injury (p less than 0.01). However death could not be predicted on the basis of these indices of severity (p greater than 0.28). Of the nine patients who underwent pelvic arteriography, three required embolization of actively bleeding pelvic vessels, but seven had intra-abdominal hemorrhage that required laparotomy, and eight developed a coagulopathy. Massive bleeding from pelvic fractures was uncommon, and the major threat of hemorrhage was from nonpelvic sites. Furthermore, although injury severity was correlated with the severity of the pelvic fracture, hospital outcome was determined by associated injuries and not by the pelvic fracture. 
Risk assessment and control of waterborne giardiasis. BACKGROUND: Waterborne giardiasis has been increasing in the United States with 95 outbreaks reported over the last 25 years. The Safe Drinking Water Act has mandated control of this pathogen. METHODS: A risk assessment model was developed to estimate risk of infection after exposure to treated waters containing varying levels of Giardia cysts. The model was defined by a dose-response curve developed from human feeding studies for Giardia and assumed 2L of water consumption per day. Data on concentrations and distribution of the organism in source waters were used to assess exposure after varying reductions achieved through treatment. RESULTS: In surveys reporting prevalence and levels of Giardia cyst contamination, average levels of cysts in surface waters ranged from 0.33 to 104/100L; from pristine watersheds (protected from all human activity) 0.6 to 5/100L. Yearly risks were 4.8 x 10(-3) for systems using polluted waters and 1.3 x 10(-4) for pristine waters with a 10(-3) treatment reduction. CONCLUSION: Public Health officials will need to work with the water industry to ensure a risk of less than 1/10,000 for source waters with 0.7 to 70 cysts per 100 liters through treatment achieving reduction of 10(-3) to 10(-5), respectively, of Giardia cysts. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from multiple neurofibromas of the cauda equina: case report. The authors report a case of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by neurofibromas of the cauda equina. An examination of the literature revealing 13 similar cases and an analysis of this case showing three neurofibromas of the cauda equina prompted an hypothesis emphasizing the origin of bleeding and the difficulties associated with a correct diagnosis. 
Deletion of mitochondrial DNA in patients with combined features of Kearns-Sayre and MELAS syndromes. A 9-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy had ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The girl had diabetes mellitus and the boy had hypoparathyroidism. Both children also developed recurrent vomiting and cerebral infarcts with lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy specimens showed ragged-red fibers and Southern analysis demonstrated a distinct heteroplasmic deletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in each patient but no evidence of the point mutation in the transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene recently identified in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). These 2 children had combined features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MELAS, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA deletions occasionally can have pleomorphic clinical expression. 
Prevalence, onset, and risk of psychiatric disorders in men with chronic low back pain: a controlled study. This study used structured diagnostic interviews and DSM-III criteria to assess lifetime prevalence and pre-morbid risk of psychiatric disorder in a sample of men with long-standing chronic back pain (CLPB) attending a primary care clinic. A control group of age and demographically matched men without history of back pain was also studied. Compared to controls, men with CLBP had significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression (32% vs. 16%), alcohol use disorder (64.9% vs. 38.8%), and a major anxiety disorder (30.9% vs. 14.3%). Almost all CLBP men ever experiencing a mood disorder reported recurrent, not single, episodes. The 6 month point prevalence of major depression, but not other disorders, was also significantly elevated for men with CLBP. In CLBP, the first episode of major depression generally (58.1%) followed pain onset. While the initial major depressive episode usually commenced within the first 2 years of established pain, late onset mood disorder was also common. By comparison in most cases (81%) onset of alcohol use disorders considerably preceded pain. When an age-matching procedure was used to gauge relative vulnerability to psychiatric illness in patients and controls, CLBP patients had significantly higher pre-pain rates of alcohol use disorder but not depression. After age of pain onset, CLBP subjects had over 9 times the risk of developing major depression, but had similar rates of developing alcoholism. We conclude that (1) alcohol use disorders rather than depression may increase risk of developing CLBP, and (2) risk of new onset and recurrent major depression remains high for men throughout their pain career. This suggests that psychological adaptation to long-standing pain may be less successful than previously thought, especially with regard to recurrent mood disorder. 
A 'unified theory' of prion propagation. There is now very persuasive evidence that the transmissible agent for spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie, consists of a modified form of the normal host protein PrPc, devoid of any nucleic acid. On the other hand, because there are many different strains of scrapie agent with distinct phenotypes which can be propagated in animals homozygous for the PrPc gene, it has been suggested that a nucleic acid must be a component of the agent. Can the two views be reconciled?. 
Analysis of the enhancer element that controls expression of sevenless in the developing Drosophila eye. The sevenless gene encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in a complex pattern during the development of the Drosophila melanogaster eye. We have previously shown that this pattern is regulated transcriptionally by an enhancer located in the body of the sevenless gene. Here we extend our analysis of the sevenless enhancer, defining a 475-base-pair fragment that contains elements necessary for the correct qualitative and quantitative expression of the sevenless gene. Within this fragment are sequence elements conserved in the sevenless gene of a distantly related Drosophila species and protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts isolated from adult heads and imaginal discs. Partial deletions of the 475-base-pair fragment result in preferential loss of expression in different subsets of cells. These results suggest that the normal pattern of expression is generated by the combined action of separate cell-specific regulatory elements. 
Helicobacter pylori gastritis mimicking gastric carcinoma at CT evaluation. The abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans from 61 patients with biopsy-proved Helicobacter (formerly Campylobacter) pylori gastritis were retrospectively reviewed. The CT scans were interpreted on the basis of the original report of the findings at CT examination and without knowledge of the results of biopsy. Of 19 patients (31%) with gastric abnormalities at CT, 14 (74%) had inflammatory changes initially reported as suspicious for gastric malignancy; malignancy was entertained as the primary diagnosis in four of those patients. In five of the 19 abnormal cases (26%), the diagnosis with CT was gastritis. The two major patterns of severe H pylori infection identified were (a) circumferential antral wall thickening and (b) thickening of the posterior gastric wall along the greater curvature, with or without evidence of ulceration. Thickening averaged 1.5-2.0 cm in cases suspicious for malignancy. The majority of abnormalities involved the gastric antrum (68%). No cases demonstrated significant adenopathy, obliteration of fat planes, or invasion of adjacent organs. 
Non-ominous micrometastases of gastric cancer. So-called R2 or wider meticulous node dissection was performed in 1368 patients with resected gastric cancer invading beyond the submucosa but without distant metastases. Survival rates were similar in subsets of patients with or without microscopic node metastases and macroscopically normal lymph nodes. The extent of node metastases has previously been shown to be one of the two most important prognostic factors in gastric cancer without distant metastases, and its lack of impact in these patient groups was not explained by the imbalance of other prognostic factors. The findings indicate that micrometastases of gastric cancer are curable by a wide node dissection made in the absence of palpable abnormality. They also offer the possibility that an extensive node dissection may yield good stage-specific survival rates, in part because of upstaging of patients. The findings should influence the recording of node metastases for evaluation of stage-specific treatment results and for research purposes. 
Excess mortality associated with diuretic therapy in diabetes mellitus OBJECTIVE. To determine whether the high mortality among diabetic patients receiving treatment for hypertension can be explained by associated risk factors or must be attributed to a deleterious effect of antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN. Cohort analytic study with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. SETTING. Outpatients with diabetes and severe retinopathy who were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of laser treatment to prevent blindness had ophthalmologic examinations every 4 months and annual medical examinations that included measurement of blood pressure and recording of anti-hypertensive treatment. Only 5.5% of the patients were unavailable for follow-up. When a patient died, the circumstances surrounding the death were reviewed and classified by a mortality review committee. PARTICIPANTS.--There were 759 participants in the study; they were white, were aged 35 to 69 years, and had normal serum creatinine levels at the baseline examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS.--Patients were classified into five groups according to information recorded at the baseline and first annual follow-up examinations: normotensive (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), untreated hypertensive, hypertensive treated by diuretics alone, hypertensive treated by other agents alone, and hypertensive treated by both agents. Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients treated for hypertension than in patients with untreated hypertension. The excess was primarily found in patients treated with diuretics alone, although that group had the lowest blood pressure with treatment. After adjusting for differences in risk factors, cardiovascular mortality was 3.8 times higher in patients treated with diuretics alone than in patients with untreated hypertension (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS.--In individuals with diabetes, intervention with diuretics to reduce hypertension is associated with excess mortality. Until there is a clinical trial showing a beneficial effect of diuretic treatment in diabetic patients, there is urgent need to reconsider its continued usage in this population. 
Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas. Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas should be distinguished from classical osteogenic sarcoma. Both occur in older patients with significantly greater comorbidity. Roentgenographically, radiation osteogenic sarcoma is typically sclerotic, whereas pagetic osteogenic sarcoma is lytic and associated with pathologic fracture. Radical resections give the best result, local control, and survival. Chemotherapy has not proven effective to date. Improvements in tumor imaging and more intensive chemotherapy regimens may permit limb-sparing surgery. Overall results remain poor, with approximately 15% five-year survival in each condition. 
Phase II trial of pentostatin in refractory lymphomas and cutaneous T-cell disease. Thirty-seven patients with refractory lymphoma or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were treated with 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin; dCF), 5 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus for 3 consecutive days of every 3-week cycle in this Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial. Included were 25 with the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, three with Hodgkin's disease, eight with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and one with unknown subtype, of whom 31 were considered eligible. The majority had failed at least two, but no more, conventional chemotherapy regimens. Ten (32%) of the eligible patients had a partial response (PR), including patients with nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic (NPDL), nodular mixed (NM), diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic (DPDL), or diffuse histiocytic (DH), lymphoma mixed-cellularity (MC), Hodgkin's disease, and unknown subtype, and in four patients with CTCL. The overall median time to treatment failure (TTF) was only 1.3 months, but the range extended to 57.3 months. The overall response duration was 16.0 months, and the range extended to 53.4 months. Overall median survival was 2.7 months, with the range extending to 63.2 months. The majority of patients had no toxicity, but there were some instances of severe or life-threatening events. Four fatal toxicities occurred, in two patients with underlying pulmonary conditions and two with prior cardiac histories. From this study, we conclude that dCF is active in refractory lymphomas and CTCLs, should be avoided in patients with a history of serious pulmonary or cardiac diseases, and warrants consideration for incorporation of a low-dosage schedule into conventional combination chemotherapy regimens, including its use with biologic response modifiers. 
Causes of blindness and visual handicap in the Central African Republic. The causes of bilateral blindness (best visual acuity less than 3/60) in 1371 people in the Central African Republic seen between 1985 and 1989 who attended eye clinics in 10 out of the 16 prefectures across the country are given. The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract (51%), glaucoma (12.7%), and onchocerciasis (8.1%). In 710 patients with unilateral blindness the main causes were cataract (38%), glaucoma (10%), iritis (7.5%), and trauma (6.3%). Bilateral blindness in children was rarely seen. The causes of visual impairment (vision between 6/18 and 3/60) in 424 patients were cataract, including aphakia (38%), maculopathy (14%), and onchocerciasis (7%). 
Mechanisms of gastroduodenal protection by sucralfate. Over the past 5-10 years, a number of studies have shown that topical sucralfate enhances a number of gastric and duodenal mechanisms, e.g., the "mucus-bicarbonate barrier," mucosal hydrophobicity, mucosal blood flow, cell viability, and local production of prostaglandins, as well as endogenous mediators of tissue injury and repair. It seems likely that the complex actions of sucralfate are in part related to direct interaction between the drug or its components (aluminum, sucrose, and sulfate) and gastric mucosal tissues, and in part related to effects of the drug on the various mucosal mediators of tissue injury and repair. Local actions may play a role in accelerating healing of ulcer-damaged mucosa, but this does not explain the protective actions of sucralfate on normal mucosa. Thus sucralfate appears to enhance the protective function of the "mucus-bicarbonate" barrier by actions on both components. This may depend in part on an interaction with the unstirred layer overlying gastric epithelium. Sucralfate has also been shown to increase the hydrophobicity of mucus gel. There is little doubt that sucralfate increases local production and release of protective prostaglandins (PGs), but the precise role played by these agents in mediating mucosal protection and in chronic ulcer healing remains uncertain. Currently, the mechanism of action of sucralfate on vascular integrity remains unknown and the role of PGs in this protective function is unclear. There is little evidence that epidermal growth factor plays any role in mediating mucosal protection by sucralfate, but it may be important in its ulcer-healing action. Sucralfate has been shown to be truly "cytoprotective" in that it protects isolated epithelial cells from damage by noxious agents. In animals treated with sucralfate, the surface epithelial cells were disrupted, but necrotic lesions in the deep proliferative zone were virtually absent. It seems likely that investigations of the actions of sucralfate and its components will move ever closer to defining the target cells, the intracellular events, and the mediators that bring about its protective and ulcer-healing activity. 
Histological grading and bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of astrocytomas. Comparative study in a series of 60 cases. The histological grade and the bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) labeling index of 60 astrocytomas of "ordinary" cell types (fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, and anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) were compared to determine whether the grading system reflects the proliferative potential of the tumors. The tumor grade was based on the presence or absence of four criteria (nuclear abnormalities, mitosis, necrosis, and vascular endothelial proliferation): Grade 1, no criterion, Grade 2, one criterion, Grade 3, two criteria; and Grade 4, three or four criteria. The BUdR labeling index, or percentage of S-phase cells, was calculated in paraffin-embedded tumor sections after in situ labeling by intraoperative intravenous infusion of BUdR, 200 mg/sq m. Exponential regression analyses showed a positive correlation between the histological grade and labeling index (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) that was stronger than the correlations between log labeling index and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001) and between grade and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that the histological grading system reflects the proliferative potential of "ordinary" astrocytomas. 
Acid perfusion test and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom index. Comparison of tests for esophageal acid sensitivity. The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test and esophageal pH monitoring are the two most popular tests for identifying esophageal acid sensitivity in difficult cases of reflux disease. Therefore, we prospectively compared these test results in 75 consecutive noncardiac chest pain patients who had both an acid perfusion test and chest pain during 24-hr pH testing. A positive acid perfusion test was defined by the replication of the patient's typical chest pain twice by the acid infusion. Esophageal pH testing identified abnormal amounts of acid reflux and correlated symptoms with acid reflux--the "symptom index." Fifteen patients (20%) had a positive acid perfusion test while 45 patients (59%) had a positive symptom index (range 6-100%). Only 9/34 (26%) patients with abnormal reflux had a positive acid perfusion test. Although it had excellent specificity (83-94%), the acid perfusion test had poor sensitivity (32-46%) when compared to the symptom index regardless of the percent positive cutoff level. The best positive predictive value for the acid perfusion test was 87%, but this occurred when the test sensitivity was 32%. Modifying the end point of a positive acid perfusion test to include heartburn improves the sensitivity (52-67%) while markedly compromising specificity and positive predictive value. Thus, esophageal pH monitoring correlating symptoms with acid reflux is superior to the acid perfusion test for identifying an acid sensitive esophagus in patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
Acute infectious erythemas in children: a clinico-microbiological study. One-hundred children with an acute illness comprising fever and widespread erythematous rash were prospectively studied to determine whether clinical presentations are helpful in defining the causative agent and to identify the most appropriate microbiological specimens. An infectious agent was identified in 65 children; 72% were viruses, 20% were bacteria, 5% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and in 3% both viruses and bacteria were detected. The most common infectious agents were picornaviruses, an atypical presentation of measles and Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus. Different patterns of rash occurred with each of these infections. The clinical presentation of a child with an acute febrile illness and rash was unhelpful in defining the causative agent. Routine management should include a throat swab for bacterial investigation and in selected cases a blood sample for IgM viral titres. 
Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations. OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality (from coronary heart disease and from other causes) below the range of cholesterol values generally seen in Western populations. DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a "low" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death. 
The value of tests predicting renovascular hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis treated by angioplasty. The aim of this study was to evaluate tests predicting renovascular hypertension. This was done by relating the results of renal vein renin tests, the captopril test, and renal scintigraphic tests to the blood pressure outcome 12 months after relief of renal artery stenosis by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in 31 patients. Cure was seen in eight (26%). Improved blood pressure was obtained in 12 patients (39%), and in 11 patients (35%), the result for blood pressure was a failure. The accuracies of the two mathematical models used to analyze the renal vein renin assays were 44% and 60%. The captopril test showed a sensitivity of 36% and an accuracy of 43%. Renal captopril technetium Tc 99m-labeled pentetic acid scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 60%. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of clinical variables in relation to blood pressure response revealed age as the only factor significantly related to blood pressure outcome. We conclude that the tests used are unfit for helping select patients for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and that age may have an important influence on outcome. 
Surgical approaches to congenital atresia of the external auditory canal. During the past 4 years, 22 patients with congenital atresia of the external auditory canal underwent 24 initial operations by either an anterior or transmastoid approach. No attempt at randomization was made, but the two groups were similar in number and pathology (in 14 cases approach was anterior and in 10 cases approach was transmastoid). Followup ranged from 6 months to 4 years. Hearing results were similar in the two groups (71% with air-bone gap less than 30 dB). There were no instances of facial nerve injury or sensorineural hearing loss. Facial nerve monitoring was used. Complications of stenosis and drainage were more common with the transmastoid approach. In both groups, hearing results were accomplished with the patients' intact ossicles or prosthetic reconstructions. Meticulous soft-tissue technique, with split-thickness grafts covering all exposed bone, is the key to preventing stenosis. For the three cases of patients with thick, acellular atresia plates, a different approach was developed. Maintaining proper orientation during the medial dissection is more difficult in these cases. By opening the antrum primarily and identifying the lateral canal, ossicles, and facial nerve, an ear canal can then be created anteriorly with these landmarks in view. An intact canal wall-like procedure is carried out. Although hearing results are similar, the anterior approach, because of fewer postoperative complications, is now our procedure of choice. Proper orientation and soft-tissue technique are the keys to successful correction of the congenitally atretic ear canal. 
Hypoxic exposure and activation of the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans. After voluntary hyperventilation, normal humans do not develop a significant ventilatory depression despite low arterial CO2 tension, a phenomenon attributed to activation of a brain stem mechanism referred to as the "afterdischarge." Afterdischarge is one of the factors that promote ventilatory stability. It is not known whether physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia, are able to activate the afterdischarge in humans. To test this, breath-by-breath ventilation (VI) was measured in nine young adults during and immediately after a brief period (35-51 s) of acute hypoxia (end-tidal O2 tension 55 Torr). Hypoxia was terminated by switching to 100% O2 (end-tidal O2 tension of first posthypoxic breath greater than 100 Torr). Brief hypoxia increased VI and decreased end-tidal CO2 tension. In all subjects, termination of hypoxia was followed by a gradual ventilatory decay; hyperoxic VI remained higher than the normoxic baseline for several breaths and, despite the negative chemical stimulus of hyperoxia and hypocapnia, reached a new steady state without an apparent undershoot. We conclude that brief hypoxia is able to activate the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans. This contrasts sharply with the ventilatory undershoot that follows relief of sustained hypoxia, thereby suggesting that sustained hypoxia inactivates the afterdischarge mechanism. The present findings are of relevance to the pathogenesis of periodic breathing in a hypoxic environment. Furthermore, brief exposure to hypoxia might be useful for evaluation of the role of afterdischarge in other disorders associated with unstable breathing. 
Celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery injury associated with left radical nephrectomy for locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis were inadvertently ligated during left radical nephrectomy for a large upper pole renal carcinoma with massive perihilar and periaortic adenopathy. Computer-generated 3-dimensional illustrations created from the computerized tomography scan demonstrated the close proximity between these visceral branches and the adenopathy mass complex, and showed how this bulky disease may interfere with surgical anatomy. When left radical nephrectomy is performed for locally advanced and/or bulky node-positive renal neoplasms, surgeons must be cognizant of the location of the major visceral arterial branches and possible anatomical distortions. 
Effects of a minimally supervised exercise program for mentally retarded adults. Previous exercise studies that attempted to improve the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of mentally retarded (MR) adults were flawed with methodological shortcomings that prevented conclusive results. At issue in these training studies were fitness test validity and reliability, exactness of duration and intensity of training, and an inordinate amount of supervision. Therefore, we sought to determine whether moderately MR adults (seven males, five females; IQ = 61 +/- 3, age = 25 +/- 3 yr) could improve their CVF through a minimally supervised 16-wk training program. Each subject repeated exercise tests twice on two different modes of exercise, the treadmill (TM) and Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), before training to ensure validity and reliability of initial CVF levels. Intensity and frequency of exercise were closely monitored. An observer was present during the training bouts, but, following initial instructions, no additional encouragement or instructions were given. Although the training program significantly increased peak VO2 (29.2 +/- 8 to 33.5 +/- 9 ml.kg-1.min-1) and peak ventilation (73 +/- 26 to 81 +/- 231.min-1) when assessed on the TM, significant changes in these same parameters were not seen when assessed on the SAE. The importance of these results was discussed. 
Cardiac surgery in the octogenarian: perioperative outcome and clinical follow-up The perioperative and follow-up results of cardiac operations employing extracorporeal circulation and cold cardioplegic arrest were examined in 191 consecutive patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age having surgery over a 5 year period (1982 to 1986). Most patients had severe preoperative symptoms with functional class III (39.8%) or IV (57.1%) limitation. The overall 30 day postoperative cardiac mortality rate was 15.7%. The total in-hospital mortality rate was 18.8%; the mean postoperative hospital stay was 16.4 +/- 13.3 days. The perioperative mortality rate for elective operations was as follows: coronary artery bypass (5.6%), aortic valve replacement (9.6%), aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (17.9%) and mitral valve surgery with or without coronary bypass (21.4%). Urgent operations were performed in 39 patients (20.4%) with a total perioperative mortality rate of 35.9%; urgent coronary artery bypass was performed in 26 patients (67%) with an in-hospital mortality rate of 23.1%. Clinical evidence of left ventricular failure, functional class IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, mitral valve repair or replacement for severe mitral regurgitation and urgent operation were associated with an increased perioperative mortality rate. Follow-up study in all 155 patients surviving postoperative hospitalization at 22.6 +/- 14.8 months showed significant improvement in symptom status in all surgical subgroups. There were 18 follow-up deaths (11.6%); 10 were noncardiac. The actuarial survival rate of the entire study group was significantly better than that in age- and gender-matched control subjects (p = 0.037). 
Interethnic differences in pain perception. While several investigators have reported relationships between ethnic background and expression of pain, such relationships are in fact highly problematical. Few studies of pain and ethnicity have used quantitative measures of pain combined with multivariate methods of data analysis. Most have focussed on populations which, unlike many in the United States today, are characterized by highly distinct ethnic groups. The study reported here interviewed 536 persons recently treated for forms of cancer known to cause significant pain. Pain was assessed using standard, well validated instruments, including Graphic Rating Scales anchored in several alternative time-frames and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The study took place in an area with a low proportion of recent immigrants and only small concentrations of distinct ethnic minorities. No statistically significant relationships were observed between ethnic identity and measures of pain sensation. However, pain described in affective terms according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire did vary among ethnicities. This observation suggests that cultures associated with specific ethnic identities still condition individual expression of pain despite the high degree of assimilation that has occurred among ethnic groups in the United States. 
The role of platelet activating factor and its antagonists in shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure. PAF has been implicated as a mediator of shock, sepsis and MOF. The results of experimental data demonstrate that PAF induces changes characteristic of endotoxemia and sepsis, including systemic hypotension and diffuse microvascular leakage. These effects are prevented by PAF antagonists. PAF induces many of the characteristic changes of MOF, including functional impairment in the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and heart. PAF antagonists will inhibit these adverse effects. PAF antagonists are now being manufactured by a number of pharmaceutical companies studying the beneficial effects of PAF antagonists in human disease. Data from these studies promise valuable information with significant clinical relevance to the practicing surgeon. 
A comparison of tocopherol and tocotrienol for the chemoprevention of chemically induced rat mammary tumors. Two forms of vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol, were tested for chemopreventive activity in two chemically induced rat mammary-tumor models. When mammary tumors were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA, 50 mg/kg), only the tocotrienol group had a statistically significant increase in tumor latency. There was no effect of either compound on tumor multiplicity. When tumors were induced by N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU, 30 mg/kg), neither analogue of vitamin E modified latency, whereas tocotrienol increased tumor multiplicity. In summary, neither vitamin analog had a major impact on mammary-tumor development after tumor induction with either DMBA or NMU. 
Increased negative inotropic effect of calcium-channel blockers in hypertrophied and failing rabbit heart. The effects on ventricular function of calcium channel blockers and isoproterenol were studied in isovolumically beating perfused control rabbit hearts and in hearts subjected to a double pressure plus volume overload studied at the early phase of heart failure. In control hearts, isoproterenol produced an increase of systolic ventricular function and relaxation that was maximal at 10(-7) M. In failing hearts, inotropic state increase in response to isoproterenol was significantly smaller (P less than .01) with no observed lusitropic effect. In control hearts, verapamil and diltiazem produced dose-dependent decreases of ventricular function which were larger with verapamil than with diltiazem (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was, respectively, 1163 +/- 131 nM and 4524 +/- 451 nM, P less than .001). In failing hearts, contractility decrease was larger than in control hearts (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was 604 +/- 69 nM and 2691 +/- 580 nM with verapamil and diltiazem, respectively). In contrast, Ro 40-5967, a new calcium-channel blocker, did not produce reductions of inotropic state with concentrations up to 10(-5) M. All three calcium-channel blockers produced a 2-fold increase of coronary flow at 10(-6) M. We conclude that the deleterious effect of verapamil and diltiazem in heart failure is due, at least in part, to a direct depressant effect of these drugs on contractility, which is larger than in control hearts. Additionally, the in vivo sympathetic compensation is probably reduced, as indicated by the decreased ventricular responsiveness to isoproterenol. 
Heart transplantation in children: an international survey. A survey of cardiac transplantation in children provided data from 381 transplantations in 362 patients from 32 centers in the United States and ten international centers. The number of transplantations continues to increase, in part because of transplantations in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and patients with congenital defects. The immunosuppression regimens were more uniform than in the 1985 survey, and triple therapy was most common. Actuarial survival rates were 85% at 1 month, 72% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. However, these improved rates are still not equal to the survival of the overall cardiac transplant population, in part because of lower survival rates in neonates. Ventricular dysfunction and rejection, rather than infection, were the leading causes of death. Rejection and infection were the most frequent complications. Also common were hypertension (39%) and seizures (25%), whereas coronary artery disease (8%) was unusual. Functional results were excellent in 85%, and only 7% were disabled. Questions concerning growth rates and many other aspects cannot yet be answered. However, it is apparent that cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population is a very worthwhile endeavor. 
Practical phlebology. Sclerotherapy of large veins. A practical, step-by-step guide for the sclerotherapy of large varicose veins is offered. First, an orientation regarding the place of sclerotherapy and surgery in the total treatment of varicose veins is given, with a practical clinical classification of varicose veins. This is followed by a detailed discussion of patient education before sclerotherapy, material to be used with recommended concentrations, injection technique, compression after sclerotherapy, instructions to the patient after injection, and procedures at subsequent visits. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of human brain after cardiac resuscitation. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the cerebral metabolic function of eight patients with severe postischemic anoxic encephalopathy secondary to cardiac arrest. Spectroscopy was performed at 18 +/- 13 and 64 +/- 20 hours after resuscitation. Glasgow Coma Scale scores at the time of initial and repeat spectroscopy were 3.6 +/- 1.2 and 3.5 +/- 1.2, respectively. In those patients whose spectra were of adequate quality to monitor pH, all demonstrated tissue alkalosis in at least one brain region. The mean brain pH at initial spectroscopy was 7.14 +/- 0.09 and was significantly alkalotic when compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls (pH = 6.98 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.0001). Five of the eight patients showed at least one region of persistent alkalosis at repeat spectroscopy, whereas one patient demonstrated severe acidosis with a pH of 6.42. Spectra demonstrated marked metabolic heterogeneity, ranging from normal in appearance to complete obliteration of all high-energy phosphates with only inorganic phosphate remaining. 
Supraciliary hemangiopericytoma. A 10-year-old black girl complaining of pain and decreased vision in the left eye was found to have a smoothly elevated ciliochoroidal mass involving the superonasal quadrant of the left eye. The mass appeared circumscribed and uniformly dense by computed tomography. The tumor was hyperintense to vitreous and cerebral white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging but was hypointense to vitreous and hyperintense to white matter on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Results of gross examination of the enucleated eye showed a sharply circumscribed, tan, intraocular mass arising equatorially. Results of histopathologic examination showed a well-vascularized spindle cell proliferation with a sinusoidal pattern characteristic of hemangiopericytoma. This is the third reported case of intraocular hemangiopericytoma and the first in a pediatric patient. 
Problems in the definition and treatment of early gastric cancer. Radical operation with extensive dissection of lymph nodes (R1, 48 patients; R2, 196 patients; R3, one patient) was performed in 245 out of 247 patients with early gastric cancer. The 5-year survival rate was only 73.2 per cent in the 34 patients with lymph node metastases (31.8 per cent). Analysis of factors influencing recurrence revealed that not only lymph node metastases but also the depth of cancer invasion could affect prognosis in early gastric cancer. This study suggests that radical operation with complete dissection of the first and second group of lymph nodes (R2 resection) is a safe and appropriate treatment even for early gastric cancer. We propose that the definition of early gastric cancer be modified to 'carcinoma with invasion confined to the mucosa or submucosa and without evidence of lymph node metastases'. 
Resection of residual mediastinal germ cell masses with the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Residual mediastinal masses after chemotherapy for germ cell tumors should be resected. Complete excision of bulky residual masses may sometimes be difficult because of problems with exposure in the region of the great vessels and important nerves. Two cases are presented in which the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (Valleylab Inc., Surgical Systems Division, Stamford, Conn.) facilitated excision of large masses after intensive chemotherapy. We found that the collapsed pseudocapsule remaining after aspiration of tumor mass allowed early improved exposure and safer dissection from neighboring vessels and neural structures. Complete excisions were accomplished and no viable tumor was found, so that the patients were spared the immediate need for further therapy. Both had uneventful recoveries. 
Risk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings. In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. 
Results of total knee arthroplasty using the posterior stabilized condylar prosthesis. A report of 137 consecutive cases. One hundred thirty-seven consecutive posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were reviewed. Average age of the patient was 61.1 years and length of postoperative follow-up period was 29.2 months. Patients were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee rating scores. Average preoperative scores improved from 52 to 92, postoperatively. Ninety-eight percent of patients had no pain or mild occasional pain postoperatively compared with 99% of patients experiencing severe to disabling pain preoperatively. Complications included one myocardial infarction, two deep venous thrombosis, one urinary tract infection, one patellar dislocation, and four wound problems. There were two incidences of seroma, one hematoma, and one deep infection requiring revision after joint debridement and systemic antibiotics. Also noted was one incidence of ligamentous laxity and one patella fracture. 
Precordial ST segment depression predicts a worse prognosis in inferior infarction despite reperfusion therapy. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. The impact of associated precordial ST segment depression in inferior myocardial infarction on angiographic and clinical outcomes after thrombolytic therapy and selective coronary angioplasty was studied in 583 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Anterior infarction (Group I), inferior infarction with precordial ST segment depression (Group II) and inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group III) were present in 289, 135 and 159 patients, respectively. Precordial ST segment depression was more frequent in circumflex than right coronary infarct-related arteries (44 [71%] of 62 versus 91 [40%] of 230; p = 0.000). Although acute patency rates were not statistically different, there was a trend toward different patency rates at day 7 (Group I 88%, Group II 84%, Group III 80%; p = 0.089) partly because of insignificantly higher reocclusion rates in inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group I 11%, Group II 10%, Group III 18%, p = 0.104). Infarct zone regional wall motion (standard deviations/chord) in inferior infarction was lower with precordial ST segment depression, both acutely (Group I -2.8 +/- 0.9, Group II -2.5 +/- 1.2, Group III 2.0 +/- 1.1; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I -2.2 +/- 1.1, Group II -2.3 +/- 1.1, Group III -1.9 +/- 1.3; p = 0.011). Precordial ST segment depression was associated with a lower ejection fraction in inferior infarction both acutely (Group I 47 +/- 11%, Group II 53 +/- 11%, Group III 58 +/- 9%; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I 49 +/- 12%, Group II 53 +/- 10%, Group III 58 +/- 8%; p = 0.000). Complication rates tended to be higher in inferior infarction when precordial ST segment depression was present. Mortality rates for Groups I, II and III were 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively. These results suggest that precordial ST segment depression in inferior infarction predicts a worse ventriculographic and clinical outcome despite reperfusion therapy. 
Synergistic effect of intraperitoneally administered calcium channel blockade and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent adhesion formation in an animal model. Previous reports have shown the benefits of calcium channel blockers and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent postoperative adhesion formation in animal models. To assess the potential benefit of synergistic therapy for the prevention of postoperative adhesion formation, these agents were studied in a rabbit uterine horn model. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 8 per group) had a bilateral devascularization injury to the uterine horns. Before closure saline solution, verapamil hydrochloride (2.5 mu/kg/hour), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (4 mg total dose), or a combination of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator at the stated doses were instilled by means of an Alzet osmotic pump x 200 hours. Adhesion scores were evaluated after this time period by estimating the total uterine horn surface involved in adhesions at a terminal laparotomy and by clinically grading the response to determine whether minimal adhesions formed. Results of the total uterine horn surface scores were (mean score +/- SE): saline solution, 44% +/- 3.7%; verapamil, 19% +/- 4.8%; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 11% +/- 3.6%; combined, 3% +/- 1% (p less than 0.01 to control and p less than 0.05 to single-drug therapy). Results of the number of animals per group with minimal adhesions were as follows: saline solution, 0; verapamil, 1; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 3; combined, 8 (P less than 0.01). These results show a synergistic benefit of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent postsurgical adhesion formation when delivered via the intraperitoneal route. 
Myonecrosis and myofibrosis as complications of sickle cell anemia. Painful crises in sickle cell anemia are associated with infarction and subsequent fibrosis of many different organs. Myonecrosis secondary to muscle infarction during a crisis and subsequent fibrosis are often not recognized as complications of sickle cell anemia. We describe four patients, all of whom had recurrent episodes of symmetric proximal muscle pain and swelling as prominent features of their crises. Muscle biopsies showed acute myonecrosis with a minimal inflammatory reaction as well as myofibrosis with abundant collagen deposition. Chronic sequelae consisted of muscle induration, atrophy, and contractures. 
Effect of chronic ethanol feeding on high density lipoprotein subfractions in rats. We have reported previously that chronic alcohol consumption in the rat produced elevated total serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, but HDL particles of the alcohol-fed rat were deficient in apolipoprotein (apo) E. In that report, serum HDL particles were prepared by successive ultracentrifugation method and there were concerns that the apo E deficiency in HDL particles was artificially produced by centrifugal forces. In the present report, apo Al affinity column chromatography was used instead of successive ultracentrifugation and it likewise yielded HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats that exhibited lower apo E: apo Al ratio than HDL from control rats (0.185 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.303 +/- 0.017, respectively). When the total serum lipoprotein fraction (d less than 1.21) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both HDL and VLDL peaks were higher in alcohol-fed rats than controls. The size of apo E deficient HDL particles from alcohol-fed rats determined by HPLC did not differ from that of normal HDL particles. When HDL (1.063 less than d less than 1.21) was subfractionated into HDL2 (1.063 less than d less than 1.125) and HDL3 (1.125 less than d less than 1.21), only HDL2 of alcohol-fed rats showed lowered apo E: apo Al ratio when compared with same HDL subfraction of control animals. Therefore, the molecular structure of only HDL2 (but not HDL3) was affected by alcohol-feeding. Another HDL subpopulation which is enriched with apo E, i.e. HDL1 (1.054 less than d less than 1.063), was also prepared. 
Use of echocardiography for patient management in chronic ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia causes regional myocardial contractile and relaxation abnormalities. The extent of ischemia is determined by the distribution and severity of coronary artery stenoses. In coronary heart disease, two powerful predictors of prognosis are the coronary anatomy and ventricular function. Management in coronary heart disease is directed by accurate diagnosis and individualized objectives. Echocardiography at rest and exercise, combined with Doppler and color flow imaging, are properly applied to the differential diagnosis of common clinical syndromes in ischemic heart disease, the identification of the proximal coronary arteries, and the effects of ischemia and prior infarction. Subsequent use of coronary arteriography partially depends on the philosophy regarding the applicability of coronary surgery or angioplasty in an individual patient. Prediction of multivessel, left main, or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease by extensive wall motion abnormalities or an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction may direct the clinician to coronary arteriography to select among coronary surgery, angioplasty, or medical management. 
Treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease: alternating noncrossresistant MOPP/CABS is not superior to MOPP. One hundred twenty-five assessable patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease were randomized to receive mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or MOPP alternating with lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin, bleomycin, and streptozocin (CABS). The median follow-up is 7.7 years. The complete response rate was 60 of 66 MOPP-treated patients (91%) and 54 of 59 MOPP/CABS-treated patients (92%) (difference not significant). The level of the disease-free survival curve at longest follow-up is 65% for MOPP-treated patients and 72% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). The overall survival at 12 years is projected at 68% for MOPP-treated patients and 54% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival. 
HLA-DR expression on the microvasculature of portal tracts in idiopathic portal hypertension. Immunohistochemical characteristics and relation to portal phlebosclerosis. We recently reported that HLA-DR antigen was expressed on the microvasculature of portal tracts more frequently in idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) than in normal livers or in other hepatic diseases, and that this HLA-DR expression may be involved in the development of the portal venopathy characteristic of IPH. The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the HLA-DR expression and portal tract lesions, as well as to investigate the immunohistochemical characteristics of the HLA-DR-positive microvasculature using liver wedge biopsy specimens obtained from 32 patients with IPH. According to the degree of phlebosclerosis of the portal veins, the portal tracts were divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe. The microvasculature in portal tracts was positive for HLA-DR in 21 (66%) of the 32 specimens and in 133 (44%) of 302 portal tracts. In the 21 specimens, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of HLA-DR-positive microvasculature among the three groups: it occurred in 57 (66%) of 86 portal tracts in the mild group, 53 (61%) of 87 portal tracts in the moderate group, and 23 (49%) of 47 portal tracts in the severe group. The HLA-DR-positive microvasculature was positive for type IV collagen and receptors of Ulex europaeus lectin I, suggesting that HLA-DR-positive microvessels are blood vessels. These findings suggest that HLA-DR antigen is already expressed on portal microvessels in the incipient stage of IPH, and that HLA-DR expression persists during the progression of portal phlebosclerosis. The HLA-DR expression may be an initiating factor leading to immunologic assault on portal microvessels in IPH. 
A prospective comparison of thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin sodium/dihydroergotamine mesylate for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in urological surgery. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli are reported to occur in up to 66% of the patients undergoing a major urological operation. Thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and anticoagulant agents, such as heparin sodium plus dihydroergotamine mesylate, have been suggested to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A total of 74 evaluable patients undergoing a major urological operation was randomized to receive either thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings, or heparin plus dihydroergotamine as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 111Indium-labeled platelet scans, performed preoperatively and on days 1, 3 and 6 postoperatively, were used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Mean patient age was 63 years and all but 1 operation was performed for neoplastic disease. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 5 of 25 patients (20%) with thromboembolic stockings, 3 of 24 (12.5%) with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and 2 of 25 (8%) with heparin plus dihydroergotamine. There was no difference in blood loss or complications among the groups. Although statistical significance among the treatment groups was not reached in this study, the trend to a decrease in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin plus dihydroergotamine, and an absence of an increase in morbidity in these groups supports the use of these modalities to decrease the morbidity and mortality of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 
Why don't all heavy snorers have obstructive sleep apnea? Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heavy snorers without apnea both show intrathoracic suction pressures during sleep that exceed their static upper airway closing pressures. Complete airway occlusion, however, occurs only in the former patient group. We hypothesized that the kinetic properties of the airflow would be different in these two types of patients because of differences in upper airway morphology. The pharyngeal computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional areas of the upper airways in 15 patients with OSA, 25 nonapneic heavy snorers, and 14 control subjects while they were awake. Nocturnal breathing was monitored with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB). The patients with OSA had a narrower airspace at the velopharyngeal (VP) level than the controls (p less than 0.01); the nonapneic snorers did not differ from the other groups. At the tongue base (TB) and the hyoid bone (HB) levels there was no difference between the OSA and the control groups, but the nonapneic snorers had narrower airways at both of these levels compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01) and at the hyoid bone level compared with the OSA group (p less than 0.05). The VP/HB ratio was the parameter that best distinguished the patients with OSA from the nonapneic snorers (lower in the OSA group, p less than 0.001). We suggest that airway collapse during sleep is favored by a narrow velopharynx associated with large hypopharynx. Some heavy snorers may not have an oropharyngeal collapse because the peak inspiratory suction pressure could already be damped down at the level of the relatively narrow hypopharyngeal airways. 
Internal mammary artery subclavian vein fistula following internal jugular vein catheterization. A case report and review of the literature. We have recently treated a patient with an arteriovenous fistula that developed after a right internal jugular vein catheterization. The patient was found to have a pulsatile hematoma and a bruit five days after removal of a temporary pacemaker catheter. Digital subtraction arteriography documented a fistula between the right internal mammary artery and subclavian vein. The fistula was surgically repaired via the cervical route. To our knowledge, an arteriovenous fistula between the internal mammary artery and subclavian vein has not been previously described as a complication of a percutaneous internal jugular vein catheterization. 
Animal model of gluten induced enteropathy in mice. The aim of our experiments was to produce a local T cell mediated immune response to gliadin in the mouse small intestine as a possible animal model of gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease. BALB/c and BDF1 mice were immunised systemically with gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant. The jejunal mucosa was challenged by feeding a gluten containing diet, and villus and crypt lengths, crypt cell production rate, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were determined to assess mucosal cell mediated immunity. In some animals permeability and local immunity were modulated by concurrent intestinal anaphylaxis or a graft versus host reaction. There were no changes in the jejunal mucosa of BALB/c mice fed a gluten containing diet after having been parenterally immunized. When, however, mice were parenterally immunised with gliadin, fed a gluten containing diet, rendered hypersensitive to helminth antigen by infection with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and challenged intravenously to produce intestinal anaphylaxis crypt cell production rate was significantly higher than in ovalbumin immunized controls at 12 days after parasite challenge. Finally, graft versus host reaction was induced in BDF1 mice that had been parenterally immunised with gliadin and were on a gluten containing diet. Two weeks later these mice had significantly longer crypts and a higher crypt cell production rate and intraepithelial lymphocyte count than control, unimmunized mice with graft versus host reaction. We conclude that active immunization with gliadin does not in itself produce intestinal cell mediated immunity to gliadin contained in the diet, or enteropathy. 
Adrenal suppression and growth retardation after injection of periocular capillary hemangioma with corticosteroids. Adrenal suppression and/or growth retardation were noted in two patients after injection of periocular capillary hemangiomas with corticosteroids. Parents should be warned of these two potential complications of intralesional corticosteroid therapy. Baseline and posttreatment adrenal function should be monitored. If iatrogenic adrenal suppression occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be necessary in situations involving systemic stress such as infection or surgery. 
Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. 
Ten-year follow-up of patients with secondary amenorrhea and normal prolactin. A group of 46 patients with secondary amenorrhea without galactorrhea or hyperprolactinemia were studied retrospectively after being clinically categorized into four groups with the use of progesterone-induced uterine bleeding and measurement of serum gonadotropins and prolactin levels. The ability to have regular spontaneous menstrual cycles and to conceive was assessed after a follow-up period of 10 years. Patients who had been classified as having hypothalamic pituitary "failure" (hypoestrogenic amenorrhea) with low levels of circulating estradiol had a greater rate of recovery of spontaneous ovulation and menses when compared with patients who had been classified as having only hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction (euestrogenic amenorrhea). The patients with diagnosis of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation or polycystic ovary syndrome generally required clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation and almost all the patients with premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea) remained estrogen-deficient and unable to ovulate. Hyperprolactinemia or an identifiable pituitary adenoma has not developed in any of the patients to date. 
Could recurrent cholangitis after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy be explained by motor intestinal anomalies? A manometric study. The aim of this study was to describe the motor patterns found in two patients with recurrent cholangitis episodes after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In one patient, cholangitis was due to a stenosis of the anastomosis between the limb and the left intrahepatic bile duct, while motility of the limb, duodenum, and distal jejunum was normal. In the second patient, no anatomical explanation was found for cholangitis attacks. However, although the duodenal motor activity was normal, the motility of the limb and of the jejunum below the jejunojejunal anastomosis was grossly abnormal: permanent minute rhythm, phase IIIs absent or rare and slowly propagated, all motor abnormalities that could promote bacterial overgrowth in the limb. This stresses the interest in performing motor studies of the Roux-limb when cholangitis remains unexplained after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. 
Tissue eosinophilia and eosinophil degranulation in orbital pseudotumor. To investigate the participation of the eosinophil in orbital pseudotumor, the authors studied surgical biopsy specimens from nine patients with pseudotumor. Surgical biopsy specimens of orbital tissue from four patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and autopsy specimens of orbital tissue from six patients without orbital diseases served as controls. Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for the cytotoxic eosinophil granule major basic protein. Eosinophil infiltration and extracellular major basic protein deposition were evident in all orbital pseudotumor specimens. In contrast, no eosinophil infiltration or extracellular major basic protein deposition was present in any of the ten control specimens. These findings indicate that eosinophil degranulation is found in orbital pseudotumor, and they also identify yet another clinical entity where eosinophil infiltration and degranulation are associated with fibrosis. 
Arteriovenous fistulas complicating biopsy of renal allografts: treatment of bleeding with superselective embolization. The use of superselective embolization was assessed as a treatment for bleeding from postbiopsy arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in renal transplants. AVFs commonly occur after biopsy procedures in renal transplants, but severe bleeding is rare. Transcatheter embolization can be used to control bleeding, but unless it is sufficiently selective, the procedure results in loss of significant amounts of renal parenchyma. During a 4-year period, embolization procedures were attempted in seven patients 30-65 years old. All had AVFs shown on arteriography. Five patients underwent embolization; occlusion occurred only in the branch supplying the AVF. In one patient with three large AVFs, two were found to have occluded the day after embolization was attempted. In another, an AVF occluded when superselective catheter position was achieved but before embolization. Catheter manipulation in these cases may have precipitated occlusion. In five cases, coaxial embolization techniques were used. Embolization materials consisted of coils in three cases: 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) in one case, 0.025 in. (0.64 mm) in one case, 0.018 in. (0.46 mm) in one case; 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) coils and gelatin foam particles in one case; and localized contrast extravasation in one case. Serum creatinine level was measured before and after embolization in all patients, and radionuclide studies were undertaken in three cases. In all patients, bleeding was effectively controlled. None of the patients showed an increase in serum creatinine level after embolization, and in four, significant improvement was seen. Nuclear medicine studies showed no loss of renal function and a dramatic improvement in one patient. No complications due to the procedure were seen. Our experience suggests that superselective embolization with coaxial catheter techniques is an effective method of treating bleeding from postbiopsy AVFs in renal transplants with minimal loss of renal parenchyma. 
Effect of preexisting brain ischemia on sympathetic nerve response to intracranial hypertension. The performance of the sympathetic nervous system during sustained moderate cerebral ischemia (CI) was examined in the present study. For this purpose, a Cushing response was elicited repeatedly during incomplete global CI in anesthetized artificially ventilated cats after vagotomy and baroreceptor denervation. In control animals without CI, sympathetic activity in response to brief elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) showed a well-repeatable two-phase reaction. During CI there was a progressive deterioration of background sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) over a period of 30 min. SND response to repeated elevation of ICP was initially similar to control response but later with progression of CI was seriously changed. 1) Instead of the usual hyperactivation, sympathetic nerve activity was depressed during intracranial hypertension. 2) The characteristic desynchronized activity either appeared later during the reperfusion period or remained absent. The progressive loss of SND response to raised ICP in developed CI was compared with the changes seen in experiments in which repeated ICP elevations were superimposed on asphyxia. These findings suggest that the sympathetic component of the Cushing reaction strongly depends on the actual state of brain stem autonomic circuits and may be seriously altered in pathological situations involving ischemic brain injury. 
Free magnesium levels in normal human brain and brain tumors: 31P chemical-shift imaging measurements at 1.5 T. We have studied a series of normal subjects and patients with brain tumors, by using 31P three-dimensional chemical shift imaging to obtain localized 31P spectra of the brain. A significant proportion of brain cytosolic ATP in normal brain is not complexed to Mg2+, as indicated by the chemical shift delta of the beta-P resonance of ATP. The ATP beta-P resonance position in brain thus is sensitive to changes in intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and in the proportion of ATP complexed with Mg because this shift lies on the rising portion of the delta vs. Mg2+ titration curve for ATP. We have measured the ATP beta-P shift and compared intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and fractions of free ATP for normal individuals (n = 6) and a limited series of patients with brain tumors (n = 5). In four of the five spectra obtained from brain tissue containing a substantial proportion of tumor, intracellular free Mg2+ was increased, and the fraction of free ATP was decreased, compared with normal brain. 
Otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux. The exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is unknown, although it is estimated that at least 25% of patients with GER have head and neck symptoms alone. These symptoms may consist of one or more of the following: excess salivation, hoarseness, "post-nasal drip," voice change, persistent coughing, food sticking in the throat, globus hystericus, otalgia, throat clearing, neck pain, sore throats, the sensation of a lump in the throat, choking spells, and bronchospasm. Carcinoma of the larynx and upper aerodigestive tract may be a consequence of chronic reflux. GER, especially when the classic symptoms of reflux are absent, is frequently overlooked as a cause of these problems. This article reviews the symptoms and pathophysiology of these conditions. The diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available to us in managing these patients are also discussed. 
The current status of maternal and fetal blood flow velocimetry. Significant progress has been achieved in regard to normative data for uteroplacental and fetal blood flow velocity and the factors which may affect these observations. Associations have been demonstrated between abnormal indices of maternal and fetal blood flow velocity and pregnancy-induced hypertension, fetal growth retardation, fetal blood gas measures, and intrapartum clinical fetal distress. However, in general, the predictive power is modest and no evidence has yet been provided to indicate that these measures can be used as a screening test in the general obstetric population. Continuing research is highly desirable. At the present time, the use of Doppler assessment of blood flow in pregnancy should be limited to the investigational setting. 
Central retinal vein occlusion associated with drusen of the optic disc. A 43-year-old man had gradual visual changes OD. Funduscopic examination revealed central retinal vein occlusion OD. Complete ocular examination revealed bilateral drusen of the optic disc, confirmed by b-scan ultrasonography. Complete systemic evaluation showed no other etiology for the central retinal vein occlusion. Over a ten-year follow-up, in the absence of systemic disease or other local ocular anomalies, we concluded that central retinal vein occlusion can arise from external compression secondary to drusen of the optic disc. 
Congenital sideroblastic anaemia in two girls. Transfusion dependent congenital sideroblastic anaemia occurred in infancy in two unrelated girls. One girl developed early organ failure which was not prevented by standard chelation treatment. The combination of modest iron burden and putative intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction could have accounted for the clinical picture. The other girl remained well, receiving regular transfusion and standard chelation treatment. She had normal liver function and no other evidence of organ damage. The syndrome is unlikely to be due to extreme lyonisation in carriers of the usual X-linked condition. The contrasting clinical patterns seen in these two patients suggest that transfusion dependent congenital sideroblastic anaemia may comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. It is suggested that such children be carefully monitored for evidence of increasing iron overload so that organ damage can be prevented. 
Novel therapy for the treatment of human carcinoid. Development of effective treatment for patients with carcinoid tumors has been hampered by lack of an experimental model. The authors have established the only long-term cell line of a functioning human pancreatic carcinoid tumor (BON) that produces tumors in nude mice. In this study the authors examined the effect of three agents, alpha-interferon (IFN), a somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS), and an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), on the growth of BON tumors. BON was implanted bilaterally as 3-mm2 pieces (subcutaneously [sc]) into male BALB/c nude mice. In the first study, 23 mice were randomized to four groups: control, IFN (1 x 10(6) units, sc, four times a day), IFN + SMS (300 micrograms/kg, intraperitoneally, three times a day), and IFN + 3% DFMO in drinking water. Treatments were initiated on day of tumor implantation. In the second study, mice were randomized to six groups: control, IFN, SMS, DFMO, IFN + SMS, IFN + DFMO, and IFN + SMS + DFMO. Treatments were started on day 15 after tumor implantation. Tumor area and body weights were measured weekly. In both studies mice were killed on day 28 after BON implantation and tumors removed, weighed, and analyzed for DNA and RNA content. In the first study, IFN either alone or in combination with SMS or DFMO suppressed BON tumor growth. When treatment was initiated after established tumor growth (study 2), however, the only effective treatments for suppression of growth of BON were IFN + DFMO and IFN + DFMO + SMS. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of human spinal cord infarction. Magnetic resonance images obtained in two cases of spinal cord infarction are described: one with hemorrhagic thoracic cord infarct, the other with ischemic cervical cord infarct with sequential magnetic resonance imagings. An enlarged cord with strand-shape or longitudinal hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images was noticed in the hemorrhagic infarct; hypointensity on the T2-weighted image was thought to be due to hemosiderin, which shortens T2 relaxation. In the ischemic infarct, a small, round area of hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, noted 9 hours postictus ("early infarct") changed on the 22nd day to a cephalocaudal strandlike hypointensity on T1-weighted image, which was enhanced by Gd-DTPA. The hypointensity suggested "pencil-like softening" in "medium" age infarct. On postictal day 49, it showed an extensive homogeneous hypointensity involving several segments of the cord on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with negative Gd-DTPA enhancement suggesting "late transverse infarct." We considered that these changes are of value in diagnosing spinal cord infarcts on magnetic resonance imagings. 
High rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. 
Stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions and total parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: frequency, complications, and the value of prophylactic treatment. A prospective, randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, complications, and value of prophylactic treatment of stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions. DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine. SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score. We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed. Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone. Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs). Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs). MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%. The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage. There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage. The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients. 
Intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents in relapsing or persistent peritonitis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Urokinase or streptokinase was instilled intraperitoneally as an adjunct to the antibiotic therapy in 16 episodes of relapsing or persistent peritonitis in CAPD patients. In eight patients the combination of antibiotics and intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents resulted in clearing of the infection with no recurrences. The treatment failed in eight other patients, who had their peritoneal catheters removed. Six of the last eight patients had either abdominal wall abscesses or persistence of the bacteria on the wall of the peritoneal catheter. Elevated post-intraperitoneal instillation peritoneal fluid neutrophil counts and positive post-instillation peritoneal fluid cultures predicted failure of the intraperitoneal instillation of thrombolytic agents in most instances. Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis. Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored. Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis. 
Expression of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos proto-oncogenes in human primary melanocytes and metastatic melanomas. Analysis of the regulation of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript expression was performed in human primary melanocytes and metastatic melanoma cell strains. The medium requirements for human melanocyte in vitro growth are phorbol esters, agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels, hormones, and growth factors. Cellular jun, jun-B, and c-fos gene expression are known to be affected by growth promoting agents. In primary melanocytes, the expression of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcripts was dependent on the growth-promoting agents present in the medium. Uniformly high c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels were observed in melanocytes cultivated in complete medium. Higher levels of c-jun RNA transcripts and low levels of c-fos RNA transcripts were observed in melanocytes cultivated in plain medium. In contrast, a range of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels was detected in metastatic melanoma cell strains cultivated in medium with or without serum. In general, an increase in jun-B and c-fos RNA transcript expression and a decrease in c-jun RNA transcript expression was observed in metastatic melanomas compared to neonatal melanocytes. These data suggest a potential role for c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos genes in the transformation of melanocytes to malignant melanoma. 
Pain characterization in cancer patients and the analgetic response to epidural morphine. In 48 patients with pain related to malignancy, a pain characterization was performed during oral opioid therapy. After an optimal epidural morphine regimen had been established, the alteration in pain relief was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization. 
Diagnosis of genetic disease by primer-specified restriction map modification, with application to cystic fibrosis and retinitis pigmentosa Detection of small alterations or abnormalities in genomic DNA (eg, point mutations or small deletions) has become increasingly important in the diagnosis of genetic disease and polymorphism. When a mutation or polymorphism creates a new restriction endonuclease site, it can easily be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the DNA region of interest, followed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease. However, useful restriction sites are the exception, and a variety of specialised techniques have been developed to identify subtle DNA abnormalities. We have shown that where a DNA mutation does not create a useful novel restriction site, such a site can be introduced by PCR and specially chosen primers. The approach is simple and inexpensive and should be broadly applicable in the diagnosis of genetic polymorphism and mutation. The technique is illustrated here by the three base-pair deletion responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis and by detection of the point mutation in the rhodopsin gene that has been associated with some cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. 
Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty following surgical repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. Mitral valvuloplasty performed 5 y after repair of a sinus venosus ASD was difficult because of a thickened septum, but resulted in improved mitral valve opening and did not lead to ASD. Thus, prior repair of a sinus venosus ASD may not be an absolute contraindication to mitral valvuloplasty. 
Value of quantitative nucleolar features in the preoperative cytological diagnosis of follicular neoplasias of the thyroid. Nucleolar prevalence, size, and outline were investigated on cytological material from cold thyroid nodules obtained by fine needle aspiration. The percentage of nucleolated nuclei in follicular adenoma (32 cases) was less than in follicular carcinoma (26 cases). In adenoma most nuclei contained one nucleolus, and nuclei with two or more nucleoli were less common than in carcinoma where most cases showed the highest nucleolar diameter values. There was some overlap between adenomas and carcinomas, however, when the mean of the 10 largest values of the major nucleolar diameter was considered. In follicular carcinoma the percentage of marginated nucleoli--that is, those touching the nuclear membrane--was, in general, greater than 20%; in adenoma the values were equal to or lower than 16%. The overlap index showed that the percentages of marginated nucleoli and nucleolated nuclei are the two best discriminatory features between adenoma and carcinoma. 
Experimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. 
Respiratory-related recruitment of the masseter: response to hypercapnia and loading. To test the hypothesis that a muscle that closes the jaw, the masseter, can be recruited by ventilatory stimuli, we studied the electromyographic activation of the masseter and genioglossus in seven normal awake males who were exposed in random order to progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia, inspiratory threshold loading (-40 cmH2O), and combined hypercapnia and loading. With hypercapnia, the masseter was generally recruited after the genioglossus had been activated. Once recruited, activation of both muscles increased linearly with increasing CO2. Combined hypercapnia and loading produced more activation than either stimulus alone. These data indicate that the masseter is activated by ventilatory stimuli that activate the genioglossus. Earlier recruitment of the genioglossus suggests that activation of the masseter serves to stabilize the mandible and allow the genioglossus to function as a more efficient dilator of the upper airway. 
Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy. Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy is characterized by severe postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, with relative or complete sparing of motor and sensory function. Of four reported cases with sural nerve biopsies, two were normal and two abnormal, revealing loss of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. We present a patient with pandysautonomic neuropathy and elevated CSF protein whose sural nerve biopsy showed active axonal degeneration. 
Aseptic meningitis following cardiac transplantation: clinical characteristics and relationship to immunosuppressive regimen. Neurologic disorders are uncommon but alarming complications of cardiac transplantation. Of 29 patients from the Utah Cardiac Transplant Program (UCTP) who had lumbar puncture because of change in neurologic function, or to assess fever of uncertain etiology, CSF pleocytosis was present in 14 patients, 4 of whom had an active infectious process involving the nervous system. In 10 other patients, CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures appeared following treatment with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The most prominent clinical signs of this aseptic meningitis syndrome are fever and transient cognitive dysfunction. 
Extubation after transsternal thymectomy for myasthenia gravis: a prospective analysis. Recommendations concerning postoperative extubation after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis are presently based upon retrospective chart reviews. We present the results of a prospective investigation of time to extubation after thymectomy for 14 patients over a 12-month period based upon a protocol that included preoperative immunologic therapy, combined epidural and general anesthesia, postoperative epidural narcotic analgesia, and a standardized approach to discontinuation of ventilatory support. After a neurologist took measures to optimize preoperative neuromuscular function, all 14 patients received agents to produce lumbar epidural anesthesia and light general anesthesia. Muscle relaxants were avoided in all but one patient. Postoperative analgesia was initially maintained with epidural hydromorphone, then therapy was switched to patient-controlled intravenous morphine sulfate. Criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, first measured at the end of anesthesia, were partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.40), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial) less than or equal to 50 mm Hg, pH greater than or equal to 7.30, and respiratory rate less than or equal to 30 breaths/min. If these criteria were not met, ventilatory support was continued postoperatively with intermittent mandatory ventilation, and the patient was weaned gradually from this support. Criteria for extubation included meeting the criteria for weaning, vital capacity greater than or equal to 10 mL/kg, and inspiratory pressure better than -30 cm H2O. Criteria for reintubation included tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 40 breaths/min), respiratory acidosis not due to narcotics, or vital capacity less than or equal to 8 mL/kg. The mean time to extubation was 9 hours (range, 0.75 to 25 hours). Mean preoperative vital capacity was 2.59 +/- 0.64 L (range, 1.90 to 4.20), which decreased approximately 50% to 1.19 +/- 0.39 L (range, 0.70 to 2.0) at the time of extubation. No patient required reintubation. Half of the patients required postoperative anticholinesterase therapy based upon serial neurologic examinations; there were no instances of cholinergic crisis. Thirteen patients returned to the ward on the first postoperative day, and one on the second day. Thirteen patients preferred epidural analgesia to patient-controlled analgesia. The time to extubation and average length of stay in an intensive care setting were markedly reduced compared to those reported in previous retrospective studies. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes neuromuscular function and decreases poststernotomy pulmonary insult will shorten the time to extubation and decrease the length of stay in the intensive care or recovery room after thymectomy. 
The use of potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser for laparoscopic removal of ovarian endometrioma. From January 1989 through January 1990, 31 patients thought to have ovarian endometrioma at ultrasonography were treated by operative laparoscopy and potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The endometriomas ranged from 2 to 9.2 cm in diameter by preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography. The operative procedure used was a three-puncture technique with a 600 micron fiber attached to a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The power setting was 10 W with a continuous pulse. In all cases endometriomas were opened, drained, and irrigated, and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser was used to vaporize or remove the entire cyst lining. The ovarian edges were inverted with the laser at the end of the procedure. With one exception, there was no recurrence of endometrioma at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography or laparoscopy. In one case, 4 months after the initial laparoscopic procedure, exploratory laparotomy was performed for resection of a large, recurrent endometrioma. The use of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser allows the laparoscopic surgeon an aggressive approach to ovarian endometriomas that in the past necessitated exploratory laparotomy. 
Localization and needle aspiration of breast lesions: complications in 370 cases. A prospective study of the immediate complications of 370 consecutive breast-imaging procedures (203 wire localizations and 167 radiographically or sonographically guided fine-needle aspirations) is reported. Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions. 
Occult pontine glioma in a patient with hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial spasm due to an intracranial mass lesion is rare. We describe a 29-year-old man with hemifacial spasm successfully treated with botulinum A toxin injections for 2 years. The development of acquired diplopia secondary to acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy prompted investigation. Computed tomography done at the time of original diagnosis and on three other occasions (concentrating on the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle) failed to demonstrate an intracranial mass lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large mass lesion in the pons presumed to be a glioma. Patients with hemifacial spasm who have atypical features, especially those with associated neurologic findings, should be screened for tumours. Our case illustrates the superiority of MRI in demonstrating pontine gliomas causing hemifacial spasm. 
Imaging of myocardial infarction in dogs and humans using monoclonal antibodies specific for human myosin heavy chains. The use of three different monoclonal antibodies specific for human ventricular myosin heavy chains in the visualization of the location and extent of necrosis in dogs with experimental acute myocardial infarction and in humans is described. Using a classic immunohistochemical method or ex vivo analysis of heart slices in dogs with acute myocardial infarction subjected to intravenous injection of unlabeled antimyosin antibodies or antimyosin antibodies labeled with indium-111, it was observed that all antibody fragments specifically reached the targeted necrotic zone less than 2 h after antibody injection and remained bound for up to 24 h. In a limited but significant number of cases (5 of the 12 humans and 11 of 43 dogs), it was possible to image the necrotic zone in vivo as early as 2 to 4 h after antibody injection. In other cases, individual blood clearance variations retarded or even prevented in vivo necrosis detection. Higher antimyosin fixation values were obtained in the necrotic zones in dogs with a rapid blood clearance relative to that of the other dogs. It is concluded that antimyosin antibodies always reached necrotic areas within 2 h. If blood clearance was rapid, in vivo imaging of the necrotic area was possible 2 to 6 h after necrosis, even in humans. In some cases, however, uncontrolled individual variations in the timing required for sufficient blood clearance hampered this rapid in vivo detection of myocardial necrosis. 
Primary vesicoureteric reflux: treatment with subureteric injection of Polytef paste. A series of 34 children with 40 primary refluxing ureters were treated endoscopically with a subureteric injection of polytetrafluoroethylene paste (Polytef). The amount injected ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ml (mean 0.3). A single injection cured the reflux in 26 ureters (65%) and the grade of reflux improved in a further 9 ureters. Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these. The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection. There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection. The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective. We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children. 
Serum biomarkers in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. To identify possible clinically valuable markers of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, we measured the serum concentrations of several commercially available biomarkers in 117 patients with this disease. The alpha-fetoprotein level was measured in 75 patients and was elevated in 8 (11%); elevation did not correlate with the presence of liver metastasis. Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels increased in 8 of 83 patients tested (10%). C-terminal parathyroid hormone levels were measured in 79 patients and were elevated in 15 (19%); their serum creatinine level was normal. Thirteen of this group had normal serum calcium levels, whereas 7 patients with hypercalcemia and no clinically evident bone metastasis had normal parathyroid hormone levels. In only 2 of 72 patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme 1 were elevated. Only 1 of 85 patients had mildly elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen, in contrast to 3 of 7 patients with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis who had moderately elevated carcinoembryonic antigen. Elevations in alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and parathyroid hormone correlated with the course of the disease in 13 patients for whom follow-up measurements were available; measurement of these markers, however, is only useful in a small proportion of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Bladder instillations of trisdine compared with catheter introducer for reduction of bacteriuria during intermittent catheterisation of patients with acute spinal cord trauma. An open, prospective, randomised trial was conducted to compare the incidence of significant bacteriuria following 2 methods of intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma. Twenty-two patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter and 50 ml of Trisdine were instilled into the bladder and left there immediately prior to withdrawal of the catheter. Fifteen patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter with a special introducer to improve asepsis (O'Neil catheter). The mean incidence of significant bacteriuria in males and females who received Trisdine bladder instillations was 0.58 and 0.48% per catheterisation respectively; in males and females catheterised with the O'Neil catheter it was 1.16 and 2.93% per catheterisation respectively. The instillation of Trisdine into the bladder after each passage of a catheter resulted in a significantly lower incidence of bacteriuria compared with that which resulted from the use of the O'Neil catheter. The former method is therefore to be preferred for aseptic intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma. 
Bio-medicus ventricular assist device for salvage of cardiac surgical patients Over a 5-year period, 41 (1%) of 4,193 patients undergoing cardiac operations underwent intraoperative or early postoperative insertion of a Bio-Medicus ventricular assist device when it became apparent that the patient could not otherwise survive. Fourteen patients were in cardiogenic shock and 7 were in cardiac arrest at the time of initiation of their primary cardiac surgical procedure, and in no instance was the device planned as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Bleeding, sepsis, and thromboembolism were frequent postoperative complications. Central nervous system deficits were observed in 16 patients during their postoperative course. Eight patients (19.5%) were long-term survivors. Of the preoperative risk factors evaluated only age was significantly associated with survival, with 7 (33%) of the 21 younger (39 to 63 years) patients surviving. Blood product usage and hospital cost were analyzed in an attempt to assess cost/effectiveness of use of this device for attempted salvage of such desperately ill patients. 
Estimation of Doppler gradients at rest and during exercise in patients with recoarctation of the aorta. In patients with suspected recoarctation of the aorta the estimation of the pressure difference between the arms and legs is an important part of the examination. Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation. Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise. There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise. There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise. Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation. 
Stimulation of protein, RNA, and nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes after abdominal surgery is not affected by postoperative amino acid supply. The effects of abdominal surgery on protein, RNA, and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes, and modification of these changes by postoperative amino acid supply, were investigated in 24 patients undergoing cholecystectomy (n = 12) or removal of gastric cancer (n = 12). Mono-nuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood and incubated with radioactive tracers in vitro. Protein and RNA synthesis, as measured using [14C] glycine and [3H]uridine, respectively, increased postoperatively. Nucleotide synthesis determined by the incorporation of radioactivity from [14C] glycine into nucleotides increased simultaneously. The concentration of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) estimated by the incorporation of [14C]adenine into nucleotides also increased. These changes were greater and of longer duration in patients with cancer operation than in those with cholecystectomy. In neither case were they affected by the amount of amino acid intake, or increases in energy intake. These results suggest that abdominal surgery stimulates protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in lymphocytes. Increased RNA synthesis may be ensured by increased synthesis of nucleotides, and increased PRPP concentrations appear to regulate the rate of nucleotide synthesis. The responses are apparently dependent upon the severity of surgery, but unrelated to the amount of amino acid supplied postoperatively. 
Aminophylline in the outpatient management of decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The objective of this study was to determine if IV aminophylline reduces the risk of relapse after treatment of decompensated COPD in an ED. Forty-six visits in which IV aminophylline was given (T visits) were compared with an equal number of visits in which it was withheld (N visits) with respect to pretreatment serum theophylline level, number of treatments with nebulized bronchodilators and use of parenteral beta-adrenergic drugs, IV corticosteroids and prednisone. The difference in 48-h relapse rates for T and N visits was examined by McNemar's test. No differences were found between T and N visits with respect to vital signs, pretreatment FEV1, arterial blood gas values, hematocrit level or blood leukocyte count. The 48-h relapse rate for T visits (22.2 percent) was significantly higher than for N visits (6.7 percent; p = 0.035). Aminophylline does not appear to be beneficial for outpatients with decompensated COPD and may be harmful. 
Reduction of gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse frequency is associated with subsequent selective follicle-stimulating hormone secretion in women with polycystic ovarian disease. Polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and altered gonadotropin secretion. Mean plasma FSH concentrations are low, while LH is elevated in a majority of patients. LH pulsatile secretion has been shown to occur at rapid follicular phase frequencies (approximately one pulse per h) in PCO, suggesting persistent rapid frequency GnRH secretion in this disorder. Anovulatory women with PCO were given estradiol (E2; Estraderm skin patches) and progesterone (P; vaginal suppositories) to produce midluteal concentrations for 21 days. The aim was to determine if E2 and P would slow LH (GnRH) pulse frequency and if this would result in augmented FSH secretion and follicular development after withdrawal of E2 and P. Plasma LH was measured every 10 min for 8 h before, during (days 10 and 20), and 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P (day 28). On each of these study days FSH was measured hourly, and E2 and P were measured every 2 h. After sampling, GnRH (25 and 250 ng/kg, iv) was given to assess pituitary responsiveness. Follicular development was monitored by vaginal ultrasound through day 34 of the study. Basal LH frequency was 8.5 +/- 0.5 pulses/8 h (mean +/- SEM). During E2 and P, LH pulse frequency fell to 3.3 +/- 1.0 (10 days) and 2.3 +/- 0.8 (20 days), 39% and 27% of the basal value, respectively, and subsequently increased to 5.6 +/- 0.7 (66% of basal) 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P. LH pulse amplitude (basal, 7.2 +/- 1.5 IU/L) was not reduced until day 20, but remained suppressed (3.9 +/- 1.1 IU/L) on day 28. As a result, mean LH (basal, 21.0 +/- 3.5 IU/L) fell progressively during E2 and P, to 3.8 +/- 1.2 IU/L on day 20, and remained low (39% of basal) 7 days after steroid withdrawal. Mean plasma FSH (basal, 7.1 +/- 0.9 IU/L) also fell during steroid administration, but in contrast to LH, had risen to 93% of the basal value by 7 days after E2 and P. LH release in response to exogenous GnRH revealed marked initial responses which did not decrease until day 20, but remained suppressed (8% of basal) after withdrawal of E2 and P. FSH responses were also suppressed on day 20, but had increased to 75% of the basal value by day 28. Initiation of follicular development occurred in all patients, and the lead follicle measured 12.3 +/- 0.8 mm 13 days post-E2 and P. Ovulation occurred in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Circumspinal decompression for thoracic myelopathy due to combined ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) combined with ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in the thoracic spine can result in serious myelopathy, leading to circumferential compression of the spinal cord in advanced stages of the disease. The authors performed circumspinal decompression (circumferential decompression of the spinal cord) on these patients. This operation consists of two steps: posterior and lateral decompression of the spinal cord by removal of the OLF (first step) and anterior removal of the OPLL for anterior decompression (second step), followed by interbody fusion. In the first step, two deep parallel gutters, covering the extent of the OPLL to be removed anteriorly, are drilled down from the rear into the vertebral body along both sides of the dura to easily and safely remove the OPLL anteriorly at the second step. In the second step, the surgical approach varies according to the affected level; costotransversectomy in the upper thoracic spine and standard thoracotomy in the middle or lower thoracic spine. According to the authors, circumspinal decompression is not an easy procedure, but from their results in 10 patients, they identify it as a radical and promising surgical procedure. 
Clinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The history, physical examination, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram and blood gases were evaluated in patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and no history or evidence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The investigation focused upon patients with no previous cardiac or pulmonary disease in order to evaluate the clinical characteristics that were due only to PE. Acute PE was present in 117 patients and PE was excluded in 248 patients. Among the patients with PE, dyspnea or tachypnea (greater than or equal to 20/min) was present in 105 of 117 (90 percent). Dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic pain was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on room air was less than 80 mm Hg in 65 of 88 (74 percent). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was greater than 20 mm Hg in 76 of 88 (86 percent). The chest radiograph was abnormal in 98 of 117 (84 percent). Atelectasis and/or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were most common, 79 of 117 (68 percent). Nonspecific ST segment or T wave change was the most common electrocardiographic abnormality, in 44 of 89 (49 percent). Dyspnea, tachypnea, or signs of deep venous thrombosis was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain or atelectasis or a parenchymal abnormality on the chest radiograph was present in 115 of 117 (98 percent). In conclusion, among the patients with pulmonary embolism that were identified, only a small percentage did not have these important manifestations or combinations of manifestations. Clinical evaluation, though nonspecific, is of considerable value in the selection of patients in whom there is a need for further diagnostic studies. 
Management of osteogenic sarcoma in children and adolescents. The management of osteogenic sarcoma in children has made a fantastic step on the survival rate, but there still remains unexpected late metastatic recurrence even in initially good responders to chemotherapy and lower survival rate in the bad responder group. Therefore, the research on etiology and on the understanding and rating of oncologic power of the tumoral cells as well as other kinds of treatment (vaccine, immunotherapy, and other types of chemotherapy) must be increased. The initial function after replacement is good and is often excellent but increasing deterioration is noticed during each follow-up evaluation. A considerable effort is still to be done for bone and joint replacement. Biocompatible material with mechanical strength and resistance to wear will be used for a long time because of the young age of the patients. There must be better use and understanding of the allograft revascularization, as well as a better biologic connection between the bone host and replacement device. This will probably be used in the future with less cement and more of a modular system. The final prognosis will remain for a long time in the perfect cooperation between the various members of the teams (oncologist, surgeon, imager, pathologist, and research team) who treat the patients. 
The morbidity of long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes. The authors report a prospective study of morbidity associated with long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes. Three hundred fifty patients were divided into two groups: 175 patients received antibiotics intravenously during the entire period that the electrodes were implanted, and 175 patients received one dose of antibiotics on the morning of surgery. In the group given continuous antibiotic coverage there were two cases of meningitis, both treated without sequelae. In the group receiving one dose of antibiotics, one patient had a brain abscess and three had superficial wound infections. There were no other instances of major morbidity or mortality in either group of patients. The total morbidity rate for both serious and minor complications was 0.85%. 
Predictors of event-free survival after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. BACKGROUND. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was developed as an alternative to aortic-valve replacement in selected elderly patients with aortic stenosis. The use of this procedure is limited, however, by a high incidence of restenosis. METHODS. Between December 1985 and April 1989, valvuloplasty was performed in 205 patients. We evaluated 40 demographic and hemodynamic variables as univariate predictors of event-free survival by Cox regression analysis and identified independent predictors of event-free survival by stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS. Early hemodynamic results indicated a decrease in the peak transaortic-valve pressure gradient from 67 +/- 28 to 33 +/- 15 mm Hg after valvuloplasty and an increase in aortic-valve area from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2 (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of event-free survival (defined as survival without recurrent symptoms, repeated valvuloplasty, or aortic-valve replacement) was 18 percent over the mean (+/- SD) follow-up period of 24 +/- 12 months (range, 1 to 47). Significant predictors of event-free survival included the left ventricular ejection fraction and the left ventricular and aortic systolic pressure before valvuloplasty, and the percent reduction in the aortic-valve pressure gradient; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was inversely associated with event-free survival. Although the predicted event-free survival rate for the entire patient group was 50 percent at one year (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 57 percent) and 25 percent at two years (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 31 percent), the probability of event-free survival at one year varied between 23 and 65 percent when patients were stratified according to three independent predictors: the aortic systolic pressure, the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, and the percent reduction in the peak aortic-valve gradient. CONCLUSIONS. The most important predictors of event-free survival after balloon aortic valvuloplasty were related to base-line left ventricular performance. The best long-term results after valvuloplasty were observed among patients who would also have been expected to have excellent long-term results after aortic-valve replacement. 
Microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale. She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy. The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism. 
Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is characterized by the spontaneous development of recurrent, sterile papules, pustules, and plaques on the face, trunk, arms, and occasionally the palms and soles. Although the large majority of the reported cases have occurred in Eastern Asians, most patients in the United States have been infants or men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. We describe a North American woman with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis who was neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor of Asiatic descent. 
Delirium and lactic acidosis caused by ethanol and niacin coingestion. A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was receiving niacin therapy for hypercholesterolemia, and 16 hours earlier had ingested a large quantity of wine. Past medical history was otherwise unremarkable; physical examination revealed paranoid ideation and asterixis. Laboratory evaluation was significant for metabolic acidosis with a calculated anion gap of 39. Liver enzymes were elevated, and lactic acid level was 9.5 mmol/L (normal: 0.5 to 2.2 mmol/L). White blood cell count was 23,100, but all cultures were negative, and all other diagnostic studies, including bilirubin, prothrombin time, and ammonia were normal. The patient recovered rapidly with hydration and administration of thiamine and magnesium. After psychiatric evaluation, a diagnosis of toxic delirium due to niacin and ethanol coingestion was made. This is the first case reporting toxic delirium and lactic acidosis due to niacin and ethanol coingestion. This occurred in the absence of significant hepatic impairment. Possible mechanisms for the observed derangements are discussed. 
Treatment of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. Bacterial skin infections occur commonly and range in severity from mild to life threatening. The severity of skin infections, and their management and prognosis, can depend on the mechanism of infection, the skin structures involved and the infecting organism or organisms. Primary skin infections result from invasion of microorganisms through tiny breaks in the epidermis or from the spread of microorganisms through the bloodstream. Secondary infections arise from pre-existing trauma, burns or surgical wounds; infections involving the soft tissues underlying the skin are also discussed. These also frequently occur in areas of trauma, operation or ischemia. The cause, bacteriologic factors and management of skin infections were studied, with special attention to pyodermas, infections of the foot in diabetic patients and necrotizing soft tissue infections. Choice of appropriate antibiotic agents depends in large part on the infecting organism and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. In necrotizing soft tissue infections, survival or limb salvage may depend on prompt surgical intervention. In these instances and in some of advanced primary skin infections in which bacteremia is involved, parenteral antibiotics are required. The available options are discussed and a report on the data with the combination agent ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium is presented. 
Iliac artery stenosis or obstruction after unsuccessful balloon angioplasty: treatment with a self-expandable stent. Obstruction or stenosis of the iliac artery was treated by placement of a self-expandable stent in 91 patients. A total of 100 lesions was treated. All patients had had poor results of balloon angioplasty including residual stenosis, iliac occlusion, and dissection. The stent used in all cases was a self-expandable stainless steel endoprosthesis mounted on a 7- or 9-French catheter and covered by an invaginated tubular rolling membrane. The diameter of the expanded stent varied from 7 to 12 mm. A total of 129 stents was placed. Technical success was 97%. Thromboses occurred immediately after placement in two patients and within the first month in six; these were mainly due to residual obstruction. Eighty-two (93%) of 88 patients with a follow-up longer than 3 months had no recurrent symptoms. Restenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia inside the stent occurred in 10 patients; these required repeated intervention in only four cases. In the remaining six patients, no further complications occurred. Our results show that self-expanding endoprostheses are of value for improving the results of inadequate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. 
Pulmonary hypertension and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase after esophageal cancer operations. To evaluate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase in pulmonary impairment occurring after operation for esophageal cancer, 10 patients were randomized preoperatively into two equal groups. One group received a placebo infusion and the other, an infusion of the PMN elastase inhibitor ulinastatin. In the placebo group, the mean plasma PMN elastase level increased from 154 +/- 23 micrograms/L preoperatively to 449 +/- 56 micrograms/L at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01), whereas the mean plasma fibronectin concentration decreased from 490 +/- 70 micrograms/mL preoperatively to 265 +/- 81 micrograms/L on postoperative day 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly from 151 +/- 24 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 preoperatively to 284 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In the group given ulinastatin, 150,000 units every 12 hours from the start of the operation, the mean PMN elastase value at 6 hours postoperatively was lower (275 +/- 66 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01) and the fibronectin level on postoperative days 1 and 2, higher (p less than 0.05). A lower pulmonary vascular resistance was noted into day 2 (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that PMN elastase may participate in the development of postoperative pulmonary impairment. 
Platelet angiotensin II binding sites in normotensive and hypertensive women. Specific binding of angiotensin II (AII) to platelets was measured in 89 women, 25 nulliparous non-pregnant women and 64 primigravida in the third trimester of pregnancy. There was significantly lower binding in the 25 pregnant women who were normotensive (2.3 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the non-pregnant women (9.0 fmol/10(9) cells P less than 0.001). Significantly higher platelet AII binding levels were found in the 39 women who had pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) (5.5 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the 25 normotensive pregnant women (P less than 0.001). Of the 39 women with PIH, platelet AII binding was higher in the 23 women who had pre-eclampsia (7.0 fmol/10(9) cells), when compared with the 16 who had non-proteinuric PIH, (4.6 fmol/10(9) cells) although the difference was not statistically significant (P less than 0.04). The pressor response to AII is also diminished in pregnancy, yet less so if pregnancy induced hypertension develops. Platelets may provide a readily accessible tissue with which to study AII responsiveness in pregnancy. 
Gastrointestinal cytology. Since the development of the fiberoptic endoscope, laboratories have received cytologic specimens obtained from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract in increasing numbers to identify infectious agents and neoplasms. Adenocarcinomas generally are easily diagnosed and distinguished from reparative atypia, but their precursor lesions, dysplasia and adenomas, provide greater interpretive challenges. The same is true for such entities as malignant lymphomas. Most mesenchymal tumors remain outside the diagnostic capabilities of most cytologists. 
Modulation of alpha smooth muscle actin and desmin expression in perisinusoidal cells of normal and diseased human livers. It has been suggested that perisinusoidal liver cells (PSC) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive changes. Using light and electron microscopic immunolocalization techniques, a series of 207 normal and pathologic human liver specimens were evaluated for the expression of alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin and desmin in this and other nonparenchymal cell types. In normal adult liver tissue, PSCs were practically devoid of desmin and exceptionally stained for alpha-SM actin, whereas this actin isoform frequently was encountered in PSCs from the embryonic to the adolescent period. A broad spectrum of pathologic conditions was accompanied by the presence of alpha-SM actin containing PSCs; these were detected preferentially in periportal or perivenular zones according to the predominant location of the underlying hepatocellular damage. The occurrence of this PSC phenotype generally was associated with fibrogenesis and was in some cases detected earlier than overt collagen accumulation. Fibrous bands subdividing liver tissue in cirrhosis and focal nodular hyperplasia, as well as desmoplastic reaction to malignant tumors, contained alpha-SM actin-rich cells admixed with variable proportions of cells coexpressing desmin. In end stages, this population was less numerous than in active fibrotic or cirrhotic processes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, alpha-SM actin was localized in microfilament bundles of typical PSCs. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the appearance of alpha-SM actin and desmin-expressing myofibroblasts results at least in part from a phenotypic modulation of PSCs. 
Breast cancer screening in a biracial community: the Charleston tricounty experience. Breast cancer remains a major cause of death among women in South Carolina. Mammography, breast self-examination, and clinical breast examination are effective methods for early detection and subsequent mortality reduction. The Tricounty Breast Cancer Screening Survey assessed knowledge of these methods and recommendations among 503 women in the Charleston area. While 57% of all respondents reported performing breast self-examination at least once per month, 13% of blacks and 6% of whites reported that they do not know how to perform the procedure. Clinical breast examinations within the past year were reported by 69%, yet 11% of blacks and 4% of whites reported that they had never had the examination. More than one third (40%) of all 503 women reported ever having had a mammogram, and 22% reported having had one within the past year. However, 18% of the blacks and 5% of whites reported never having heard of the procedure. The major barriers to mammography appear to be the belief that women do not need regular mammograms and the lack of recommendations by their physicians. Survey results support the need for educating women about what the procedures are, the importance of using them regularly, and the means to comply with them. 
Skin test reactivity in patients suffering from lung and breast cancer. Mast cells and histamine-mediated reactions may be altered in patients with cancer. In an attempt to characterize the possible skin defects in patients with cancer, we tested 22 patients suffering from lung cancers, 30 from breast cancers, and 30 age-matched normal individuals, using several compounds, in investigating the pathophysiology of the skin response. Histamine hydrochloride (10 and 100 mg/ml) and codeine phosphate (9%) were tested by prick test. Substance P (50 and 500 ng per injection site), phentolamine (20 micrograms per injection site), and carbachol (1 microgram per injection site) were tested by intradermal skin tests. Skin mast cells were also microscopically examined in 10 patients with lung cancer, five with breast cancer, and 10 normal subjects. The mean wheal sizes induced by all the tested substances were similar in patients with cancer and chronic bronchitis and in normal individuals. The flare to histamine, codeine phosphate, and substance P was completely abolished in 7/22 patients with lung cancer, but the lack of flare was not related to the age of the patients, nor to the staging of cancer, nor to metastasis. The mean numbers of alcian blue-stained or toluidine blue-stained positive mast cells were similar in normal subjects and in subjects with cancer. This study does not confirm the skin hyporeactivity of patients with cancer. 
Decreased fibrinolytic activity and increased platelet function in hypertension. Possible influence of calcium antagonism. Twelve patients with mild hypertension were compared, after 14 days of placebo, with an age- and gender-matched group of 12 healthy volunteers for platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity. Following this, 10 of the 12 hypertensives were treated with the calcium antagonist isradipine for 12 months. Blood was drawn for determinations of platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity after two weeks and 12 months of treatment. Platelet aggregation tended to increase in the hypertensives compared with controls, indicated by a lowering of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) threshold value for irreversible aggregation. Tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity was significantly decreased in hypertensives compared to controls (P less than .05). During therapy, platelet aggregation decreased and t-PA activity increased (P less than .05). The present data suggest that fibrinolytic activity is decreased and platelet aggregation increased in mild hypertension. Besides the blood pressure-lowering effect, isradipine may protect against thromboembolic diseases by modifying platelet function and fibrinolytic activity. 
How mothers keep their babies warm. Details of room temperature, clothing, and bedding used by night and by day and in winter and in summer were recorded for 649 babies aged 8 to 26 weeks. Room temperature at night was significantly related to outside temperature and duration of heating. Total insulation was significantly related to outside temperature and to minimum room temperature, but there was wide variation in insulation at the same room temperature. High levels of insulation for a given room temperature were found particularly at night and in winter, and were associated with the use of thick or doubled duvets and with swaddling. At least half the babies threw off some or all of their bedding at night, and at least a quarter sweated. Younger mothers and mothers in the lower social groups put more bedclothes over their babies, and the latter also kept their rooms warmer. Many mothers kept their babies warmer during infections. 
Use of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity. Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it. The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery. Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13). The various recorded parameters are discussed, and it is concluded that the patients with a closed mastoid cavity can tolerate a hearing aid in the operated ear at least as well as the control subjects with no ear surgery. 
T-cell receptor delta gene recombination in common acute lymphoblastic leukemia: preferential usage of V delta 2 and frequent involvement of the J alpha cluster. A high frequency (greater than 80%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) exhibit a recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain locus. Interestingly, distinct TCR delta elements are preferentially used in immunologic subtypes. In a recent series of 201 children with common ALL (cALL) we observed a TCR delta rearrangement in 162 patients, 57% of the latter showing a hybridization pattern in Southern blots suggestive of a V delta 2 to D delta 3 recombination. To verify this interpretation and to elucidate in more detail the diversity of this common type of TCR delta recombination we amplified and sequenced the junctional region of nine cALL patients and cell line REH-6 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A V delta 2 D delta 3 recombination was confirmed in all cases; convincing evidence for the participation of D delta 1 or D delta 2 elements was not obtained. Eight of nine patients and REH-6 showed complete 5' D delta 3 boundaries within V delta 2 D delta 3 segments, a limitation of junctional diversity also detected in 50% of peripheral blood cell clones derived from two healthy probands. Notably, sequence identity at the V delta 2 D delta 3 junction was demonstrated for a cALL and one of the control clones. Another group of 35 of 162 cALL patients was characterized by V delta 2 rearrangements and biallelic deletion of J delta and C delta sequences. Using a J alpha consensus primer, PCR-directed sequence analysis demonstrated V delta 2 D delta 3 J alpha recombinations in all four cases analyzed by this approach. The J alpha segments of these patients differed, but were identical or homologous to published J alpha elements. Our data suggest a recombination pathway of the TCR delta/alpha locus leading to chimeric TCR alpha molecules, containing V delta and, remarkably, also D delta sequences. 
Antiproliferative effects of cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma. A panel of 12 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines has been used to determine sensitivity of tumor cells to cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) in vitro. Antiproliferative activity of these cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck monolayers was measured in a colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]-based assay. All 12 cell lines tested were sensitive to IFN-gamma, with the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) ranging from 0.07 +/- 0.001 to 104 +/- 4.6 U/mL. The TNF-alpha showed antiproliferative activity on three cell lines at relatively high doses (ID50 from 55 +/- 4.1 to 847.10 +/- 10 U/mL), and IFN-alpha was growth inhibitory in only one line (ID50 = 1211 +/- 46.2 U/mL). The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on eight cell lines and an additive effect on two cell lines. In two cell lines, the effect of the combination was equal to that of IFN-gamma alone. A combination of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha resulted in cell growth inhibition in six of the seven lines tested, and this effect was synergistic. These in vitro studies indicate that combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may be more growth inhibitory against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and at lower doses than each of these cytokines used singly. 
Acid perfusion test and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom index. Comparison of tests for esophageal acid sensitivity. The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test and esophageal pH monitoring are the two most popular tests for identifying esophageal acid sensitivity in difficult cases of reflux disease. Therefore, we prospectively compared these test results in 75 consecutive noncardiac chest pain patients who had both an acid perfusion test and chest pain during 24-hr pH testing. A positive acid perfusion test was defined by the replication of the patient's typical chest pain twice by the acid infusion. Esophageal pH testing identified abnormal amounts of acid reflux and correlated symptoms with acid reflux--the "symptom index." Fifteen patients (20%) had a positive acid perfusion test while 45 patients (59%) had a positive symptom index (range 6-100%). Only 9/34 (26%) patients with abnormal reflux had a positive acid perfusion test. Although it had excellent specificity (83-94%), the acid perfusion test had poor sensitivity (32-46%) when compared to the symptom index regardless of the percent positive cutoff level. The best positive predictive value for the acid perfusion test was 87%, but this occurred when the test sensitivity was 32%. Modifying the end point of a positive acid perfusion test to include heartburn improves the sensitivity (52-67%) while markedly compromising specificity and positive predictive value. Thus, esophageal pH monitoring correlating symptoms with acid reflux is superior to the acid perfusion test for identifying an acid sensitive esophagus in patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
A randomized trial of alternating chemotherapy versus best supportive care in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. From April 1985 to September 1988, 128 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial evaluating chemotherapy (arm A) versus best supportive care (arm B). Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CE'P regimen) alternating every 4 weeks with methotrexate 30 mg/m2 IV day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m2 IV day 1, and lomustine (CCNU) 70 mg/m2 orally day 1 (MEC' regimen) until progression. Of the 123 patients (62 treated and 61 controls) eligible for survival, 115 were fully evaluable for response (58 treated and 57 controls). Response rates were 21% partial response, 53% stable disease, and 26% progressive disease in arm A, and 47% stable disease and 53% progressive disease in arm B. Median survival was 34.3 weeks (range, 4.3 to 218.6+ weeks) in arm A versus 21.1 weeks (range, 4.3 to 188.6 weeks) in arm B; the difference was not significant at P = .153 (Mantel-Cox). Subgroups of patients retrospectively analyzed by age, performance status, stage M0/M1, and weight loss or not showed no significant difference in survival. Poor-risk patients (at least two of the following: poor performance status, stage M1, weight loss) of arm A survived significantly longer than poor-risk patients of arm B (23.6 weeks v 12.4 weeks, Mantel-Cox P = .008); a significant difference in survival was also observed between nonsquamous cell patients of arm A and those of arm B (median survival, 38.6 weeks v 16.7 weeks; Mantel-Cox P = .041). Toxicity on the chemotherapy arm was hematologic (World Health Organization [WHO] grade greater than 3) in 12% of CE'P and in 13% of MEC' courses and gastroenteric (WHO grade greater than 3) in 24% of CE'P courses and in 8% of MEC' courses. Our alternating treatment was not significantly superior to supportive care. It is likely that certain subgroups of the NSCLC category may have an advantage with chemotherapy. 
Effect of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene in rats. The effects of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats fed with 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) were followed morphologically and histologically for a period of 20 wk. No differences between treated and control rats in the morphology and histology of their livers was observed. Cell damage was extensive in the livers of AAF-treated rats but less extensive in the AAF-tocotrienols-treated rats when compared with normal and tocotrienols-treated rats. 2-Acetylaminofluorene significantly increases the activities of both plasma and liver microsomal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT). Tocotrienols administered together with AAF significantly decrease the activities of plasma GGT after 12 and 20 wk (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.002, respectively) and liver microsomal UDP-GT after 20 wk (P less than 0.02) when compared with the controls and with rats treated only with tocotrienols. Liver microsomal GGT also showed a similar pattern to liver microsomal UDP-GT but the decrease was not significant. These results suggest that tocotrienols administered to AAF-treated rats reduce the severity of hepatocarcinogenesis. 
Effect of thrombolysis on the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Patients with late potentials in the signal averaged electrocardiogram are more at risk of lethal arrhythmias in the period after acute myocardial infarction. To test the effects of thrombolysis on the incidence and evolution of late potentials, 158 consecutive patients were prospectively studied during the first 10 days after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of two groups: 93 control patients treated conservatively and 65 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Recordings of signal averaged electrocardiogram were obtained within two days and 7-10 days after infarction. The incidence of late potentials in the first two days after infarction was not significantly different in the thrombolytic and control groups (14% v 11.8%). By 7-10 days the incidence of late potentials among patients who underwent thrombolysis remained unchanged (14%); however, it increased significantly in the control group (11.8% to 22.5%). Thus thrombolysis seems to reduce the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Because the risk of fatal arrhythmias is higher in patients with late potentials this study may partly explain the reduced mortality after thrombolysis. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus in Sjogren's disease. We report an unusual case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, manifesting as an intraventricular mass and causing unilateral hydrocephalus in a 48-year-old man who suffered from Sjogren's disease and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass. 
Colic medication and apparent life-threatening events. Eight infants with histories of apnea and cyanosis were referred to the Southwest SIDS Research Institute for evaluation of apparent life threatening events (ALTE). All of the infants had been treated for colic with a 1:1 concentration of dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and phenobarbital, hyoscyamine sulfate, atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide (Donnatal). The medication was pre-mixed by local pharmacists. A comprehensive work-up failed to reveal a cause for the ALTE in any infant. The Dramamine/Donnatal mixture was withdrawn and polygraphic evaluation was conducted. Cardiorespiratory abnormalities were identified in all eight infants and significant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) was documented in four. The possibility that colic medication contributes to cardiorespiratory instability and GER in vulnerable infants requires serious consideration and further evaluation. 
A direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy. We report the case of a patient with pseudophakic cystoid macular edema whose visual acuity improved promptly with oral administration of 500 mg of acetazolamide extended-release capsules BID for two weeks. However, vision worsened again within two weeks of discontinuation of the treatment. On resumption of acetazolamide therapy for three weeks, and its slow withdrawal during the following three weeks, the macular edema eventually resolved, and vision returned to normal. Our observation provides a direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy and shows the importance of tapering the doses of this regimen. 
Prevalence of migraine in low-tension glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma in Japanese. We studied the prevalence of migraine in low-tension glaucoma (LTG) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Seventy seven Japanese patients with LTG, 73 with POAG, and 75 normal subjects were randomly selected and tested with a headache questionnaire. The prevalence of headache with or without typical migrainous features (unilateral headache or ocular pain, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance before headache) was 51% in LTG, 42% in POAG, and 44% in normal patients. The prevalence of headache with two migrainous features or more (probable migraine) was 17% in LTG, 11% in POAG, and 12% in normal subjects. The prevalence of headache with three migrainous features (classical migraine) was 5% in LTG, 3% in POAG, and 3% in normal subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any types of migraine between the three groups of patients (p greater than 0.05). These results suggest there is no significant relationship between migraine and LTG or POAG in Japanese patients. 
Cervical esophageal motility: evaluation with US in progressive systemic sclerosis. High-resolution ultrasound (US) showed that initial peristalsis propelled ingested soda smoothly and rapidly in 20 volunteers without symptoms who met both manometric and radionuclide esophageal scintigraphic (RES) criteria for normal motility. Twenty-eight patients with progressive systemic sclerosis were classified according to results of RES as follows: group 1, normal esophageal motility (three patients [11%]); group 2, hypomotility of the esophagus, excluding the cervical esophagus (18 patients [64%]); and group 3, hypomotility of the cervical esophagus (seven patients [25%]). In the seven patients of group 3, US demonstrated that an incomplete peristalsis sequence or a feeble peristalsis propelled the soda in a slow and/or to-and-fro motion with low velocities. In the other 21 patients (75%), the soda passed through the esophagus smoothly and rapidly. Retention of soda in the cervical esophagus was not limited to patients with hypomotility of the cervical esophagus. It is concluded that US is useful in evaluation of cervical esophageal motility. 
Pretranslational regulation of albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing mice. The role of anorexia and undernutrition. Hepatic albumin synthesis, serum albumin turnover, and hepatic albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) content were evaluated in mice bearing a transplantable low differentiated tumor (MCG 101). Results obtained on tumor-bearing mice were compared with results obtained from non-tumor-bearing animals that were either freely fed, food restricted so that their body composition was similar to tumor-bearing animals (pair-weighed), fed a protein-free diet for 5 days, or fasted for 48 hours. Tumor-bearing animals became hypoalbuminemic (33 +/- 5 vs. 44 +/- 3 g/L in freely fed mice), which could be explained by both depressed albumin synthesis (1.95% +/- 0.20% vs. 2.67% +/- 0.27%/h in freely fed mice) and increased albumin degradation. Pair-weighed and protein-calorie malnourished controls had reductions in albumin synthesis (1.81% +/- 0.18% and 1.67% +/- 0.17%/h, respectively) similar to tumor-bearing animals, and the starved controls had the lowest synthetic rates (1.07% +/- 0.10%/h). Albumin degradation was increased only in tumor-bearing animals. Hepatic albumin mRNA in undernourished animals was less (tumor bearing, 32% +/- 5%; pair weighed, 47% +/- 4%; 48 hours fasted, 18% +/- 2%; and protein-calorie malnourished, 26% +/- 3%) than 50% of the mRNA content in the livers of freely fed control mice. Messenger RNA-directed synthesis of albumin in vitro was also depressed to a variable degree in tumor-bearing and malnourished non-tumor-bearing controls. The hypoalbuminemia in tumor-bearing animals could not be prevented by daily injections of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 1 microgram/g body wt), but the hepatic acute phase protein serum amyloid P decreased from 157 +/- 12 to 103 +/- 9 micrograms/mL in indomethacin-treated tumor-bearing mice (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that increased albumin degradation seen in tumor-bearing animals cannot be explained by associated malnutrition, whereas tumor-associated malnutrition can explain to a large extent the depressed albumin synthesis. Decreased albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing animals correlated in part with a decreased quantity of liver albumin mRNA. The results of the current study are consistent with either a reduced transcription of the albumin gene or a change in albumin mRNA processing and stability communicated by anorexia and malnutrition. 
Cogan's syndrome complicated by lacunar brain infarcts. Cogan's syndrome, nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis with vestibuloauditory dysfunction, is an uncommon disease of young adults, probably a manifestation of vasculitis. A 32 year old woman with this syndrome developed a thalamic syndrome with amnesia and dysphasia due to lacunar infarcts. 
Impact of autologous bone marrow infusion on hematopoietic recovery after high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. Because of potential tumor contamination and inadequacy of current purging technique of bone marrow in patients with solid tumors, we investigated an alternative approach to high-dose therapy without autologous bone marrow (ABM) infusion. Three levels of nonmyeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide 4.5 to 5.25 g/m2, etoposide 750 to 1,200 mg/m2, and cisplatin 120 to 165 mg/m2 (CVP) were administered to patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients were randomized to ABM (n = 46) or no-ABM (NABM) (n = 46) infusion after CVP to study the impact of ABM on hematopoietic recovery, morbidity, and mortality. All patients had ABM harvested, underwent conventional chemotherapy, and then received CVP. Seventy-three patients received two courses of similar doses. The following were the median days to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.1 x 10(9)/L: for the ABM arm, 19, 21, and 19 and for the NABM arm, 23, 20, and 21 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, during course 1 (P = .01, .80, and .01, respectively). During course 2, ANCs to 0.1 x 10(9)/L and 0.5 x 10(9)/L were attained significantly faster at levels 1 and 3 in the ABM arm. ANC to 1.0 x 10(9)/L was comparable in both arms. Incidence of infection and duration of fever were similar in both arms. Although mortality and the incidence of delayed hematopoietic recovery were more frequent in the NABM arm, this was not statistically significant. Platelet recovery was consistently prolonged in course 2 in both arms, with demonstrable benefit of ABM in course 2 when dose levels were collectively considered. We conclude that (1) ABM enhanced recovery of ANC to 0.1 x 10(9)/L; (2) ABM did not decrease the incidence of infections and the duration of fever; and (3) CVP can be safely given without ABM to carefully selected patients. 
Prevalences of endoscopic and histological findings in subjects with and without dyspepsia OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic and histological diagnoses. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of people with dyspepsia and controls matched for age and sex identified by questionnaire survey of all inhabitants aged 20 to 69. Endoscopy and histological examination was performed with the examiner blind to whether or not the patient had dyspepsia. SETTING--Population based survey in Sorreisa, Norway. SUBJECTS--All people with dyspepsia and age and sex matched people without dyspepsia were offered endoscopy. A total of 309 people with dyspepsia and 310 without dyspepsia underwent endoscopy, giving 273 matched pairs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of endoscopic and histological diagnoses made according to internationally accepted standards. RESULTS--In all, 1802 of 2027 (88.9%) people returned the questionnaire. Of the 163 subjects who refused endoscopy, 114 were controls. Of five endoscopic and four histological diagnoses only peptic ulcer disease, endoscopic duodenitis, and active chronic gastritis were diagnosed significantly more often in people with dyspepsia. In all, 30% to 50% of the diagnoses of mucosal inflammation and peptic ulcer disease were made among subjects without dyspepsia, and only 10% of both those with and those without dyspepsia had normal endoscopic findings. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic findings, with possible exceptions of peptic ulcer disease and endoscopic duodenitis, showed no association of clinical value with dyspeptic symptoms. The small number of "normal" endoscopic findings in both those with and those without dyspepsia challenge well accepted endoscopic and histological diagnostic criteria with relation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Transcription, storage and release of atrial natriuretic factor in the failing human heart. 1. In this study the relationship between the synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor at the level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and the atrial storage and circulating plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor were investigated in 15 patients with heart failure. The patients underwent right and left heart catheterization before cardiac surgery for valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting. 2. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were correlated to atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. Atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor exhibited a close correlation to both pulmonary artery pressure and left atrial pressure. No relationship, however, could be found between the right atrial content of atrial natriuretic factor and both the expression of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA in the atria and the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. 3. From these data it may be concluded that increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the pressure- and/or volume-overloaded heart are associated with an elevated level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. We suggest that not only plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor but also the expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the atrial are related to left ventricular filling pressures in the failing human heart. 
Intracerebral Hodgkin's disease in a human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patient. Intracerebral involvement of Hodgkin's disease (HD) is rarely described, with only 42 cases in the literature. Since the outbreak of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, there has been an increasing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV+) persons who have diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, more recently, atypical aggressive HD. The authors report the case of a patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) and Stage IVB HD who, after a drug-induced clinical remission, had intracerebral mixed-cellularity HD. This appears to be the first report of intracerebral HD in a person who is HIV+. 
Lack of induction of suppressor T cells by intestinal epithelial cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanisms underlying the chronic unrelenting inflammatory response seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly understood. We have recently proposed a novel role for the normal intestinal enterocyte, that of antigen presenting cell. However, in contrast to conventional antigen presenting cells, normal enterocytes appear to selectively activate CD8+ antigen nonspecific suppressor T cells. To determine whether failure of this process may be occurring in inflammatory bowel disease, freshly isolated enterocytes from small and large bowel from normal patients, patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory (diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, and gold induced colitis) controls were co-cultured with allogeneic T cells in a modified mixed lymphocyte reaction. In contrast to normal enterocytes, 42/42 Crohn's and 35/38 ulcerative colitis-derived epithelial cells stimulated CD4+ T cells, whereas 65/66 and 9/9 normal and inflammatory control enterocytes, respectively, stimulated CD8+ T cells (as previously described), suggesting that the results seen were not just a reflection of underlying inflammation. Furthermore, IBD enterocytes from both histologically involved and uninvolved tissue were similar in their ability to selectively activate CD4+ T cells, speaking for a more global defect in epithelial cells in IBD. Finally, activated T cells from IBD epithelial cell-stimulated mixed lymphocyte cultures displayed potent T helper activity in an antigen nonspecific fashion. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be an intrinsic defect in epithelial cells from patients with IBD, resulting in the inability to normally stimulate suppressor T cells in an antigen overloaded environment. 
Leukoaraiosis and ventricular enlargement in patients with ischemic stroke. We studied the relationship between ventricular size and nonspecific periventricular lucency on computed tomograms (leukoaraiosis) in 192 patients with ischemic stroke. Leukoaraiosis did not occur in 21 patients less than 50 years of age; ventricular size could not be measured in an additional 29. Leukoaraiosis was graded from 0 to 4 on a semiquantitative scale; bicaudate, frontal horn, and posterior horn indices were used as measures of ventricular size. Patients with leukoaraiosis were older (difference between means 7 years, t = 5.3, df = 140, p less than 0.0001) and had larger bicaudate indices (difference between means 0.023, t = 3.54, df = 140, p = 0.0007) than patients without leukoaraiosis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age and leukoaraiosis were independent. No effect of lesion type (cortical or lacunar infarct, or both) on bicaudate index could be demonstrated. Larger values for the bicaudate index were associated with a predominantly anterior location of leukoaraiosis. The frontal horn and occipital horn indices increased with age, but we could not find an effect of leukoaraiosis on these indices. 
Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation (CAFA) Study. The Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential of warfarin to reduce systemic thromboembolism and its inherent risk of hemorrhage. As a result of the publication of two other "positive" studies of similar design and objective, this study was stopped early before completion of its planned recruitment of 630 patients. There were 187 patients randomized to warfarin and 191 to placebo. Permanent discontinuation of study medication occurred in 26% of warfarin-treated and 23% of placebo-treated patients. The target range of the international normalized ratio was 2 to 3. For the warfarin-treated patients, the international normalized ratio was in the target range 43.7% of the study days, above it 16.6% of the study days and below it 39.6% of the study days. Fatal or major bleeding occurred at annual rates of 2.5% in warfarin-treated and 0.5% in placebo-treated patients. Minor bleeding occurred in 16% of patients receiving warfarin and 9% receiving placebo. The primary outcome event cluster was nonlacunar stroke, noncentral nervous systemic embolism and fatal or intracranial hemorrhage. Events were included in the primary analysis of efficacy if they occurred within 28 days of permanent discontinuation of the study medication. The annual rates of the primary outcome event cluster were 3.5% in warfarin-treated and 5.2% in placebo-treated patients, with a relative risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence limits, -63.5%, 75.5%, p = 0.17). 
The importance of adequate anticoagulation to prevent early thrombosis after stenting of stenosed venous bypass grafts. Stent implantation in native coronary arteries may be complicated by acute thrombosis, despite the use of stringent anticoagulation. Thrombotic occlusion of stented venous grafts may occur less frequently, possibly because of the larger caliber of these grafts. We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75). Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two. After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol. Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients. A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy. It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation. 
Blood pressure during pregnancy in Canadian Inuit: community differences related to diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess a possible relation between the incidence of hypertension during pregnancy and the consumption of fatty acids found in fish and sea mammals. DESIGN: Retrospective survey of pregnancy-induced hypertension; prospective diet survey. SETTING: Inuit women from seven communities in the Keewatin region of the Northwest Territories. PATIENTS: All women from Arviat (formerly Eskimo Point), Baker Lake, Chesterfield Inlet, Coral Harbour, Repulse Bay, Sanikiluaq and Whale Cove who gave birth between Sept. 1, 1984, and Aug. 31, 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All blood pressure measurements recorded during the pregnancy, incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in the seven communities, harvest of country food (food obtained from the land or sea rather than bought in a store) for six of the communities, self-reported consumption of fish, sea mammals and terrestrial mammals by a subgroup of the subjects and levels of phospholipid fatty acids in cord serum samples from a subgroup of the infants. MAIN RESULTS: Significantly lower mean diastolic blood pressure values during the last 6 hours of pregnancy were noted for the women from the three communities with a higher consumption of fish and sea mammals (78.2 [95% confidence limits (CL) 76.6 and 79.9] mm Hg) than for those from the four communities with a lower consumption of such food (81.5 [95% CL 80.1 and 82.9] mm Hg) (p less than 0.005). The relation between community diet type and blood pressure was independent of other factors. Correspondingly, the women from communities with a lower consumption of marine food were 2.6 times more likely to be hypertensive during the pregnancy than those from communities with a higher consumption of marine food (p less than 0.007). Parity (p less than 0.05) and prepregnancy weight (p less than 0.005) were also significantly associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension; however, the relation between hypertension and community diet type remained significant in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 2.56, p = 0.03). The differences between the community groups were substantiated by the results of the diet survey, the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the cord serum phospholipids and the harvest data. CONCLUSIONS: Increased consumption of fish may be beneficial for women at risk for hypertension during pregnancy. A prospective randomized trial of fish or EPA supplementation during pregnancy is warranted. 
Prevention of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in cystic fibrosis by early treatment. To assess whether chronic pulmonary colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis is preventable, 26 patients who had never received anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy were randomly allocated to groups receiving either no anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy or oral ciprofloxacin and aerosol inhalations of colistin twice daily for 3 weeks, whenever Ps aeruginosa was isolated from routine sputum cultures. During the 27 months of the trial, infection with Ps aeruginosa became chronic in significantly fewer treated than untreated subjects (2 [14%] vs 7 [58%]; p less than 0.05) and there were significantly fewer Ps aeruginosa isolates in routine sputum cultures in the treated group (49/214 [23%] vs 64/158 [41%]; p = 0.0006). Thus, chronic colonisation with Ps aeruginosa can be prevented in cystic fibrosis by early institution of anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy. 
Primary biliary cirrhosis: relation between hepatic function and pulmonary function in patients who never smoked. We studied the relationship between selected variables of hepatic and pulmonary function in 47 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were participating in a prospective study to assess sequential pulmonary function at yearly intervals. An additional 20 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were liver transplant candidates awaiting transplantation, were studied. None of the 67 patients ever smoked cigarettes. Severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was characterized by histological stage and the Mayo risk score derived from a Cox regression model that used the following variables: serum bilirubin and serum albumin levels, age, prothrombin time and clinical severity of edema. Pulmonary function assessment included key variables describing expiratory airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec divided by forced vital capacity) and efficiency of gas exchange (steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide). We found a significant relationship between histological stage of primary biliary cirrhosis and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.02) and between the Mayo risk score for disease severity and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.03). Progressive deterioration of steady-state diffusing capacity was associated with increasing severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. No relationship existed between pulmonary function and the presence of sicca complex or Sjogren's syndrome or the clinical manifestations of portal hypertension (e.g., esophageal varices, ascites and splenomegaly). No significant relationship existed between expiratory airflow and severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. We conclude that in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who have never smoked, a statistically significant relationship exists between the severity of the liver disease and the efficiency of gas exchange measured by steady-state diffusing capacity. 
Access to health care. One neurologist's perspective. Millions of residents of the United States have difficulty obtaining health care. Barriers impeding access to care include poverty, physical unavailability of health care services, absence of health insurance, and physicians unwilling to care for uninsured patients. Many patients do not successfully use health services because of educational, cultural, and language barriers. A major access barrier is lack of health insurance. Over 30 million people in the United States have none, the so-called medically indigent. Among them are over 3 million people with neurologic disorders. They have additional barriers to overcome because often they cannot work, cannot drive, have difficulty using public transportation, and have major cognitive and communication impairments. Medical and governmental bodies are debating solutions to the health care access crisis. Physicians should actively participate in this national debate. Neurologists should address the special needs of patients with neurological disorders. 
Effects of enflurane on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia. The effects of enflurane on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters and on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed stimulation were studied in 12 patients (11 men, 1 woman, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 8 years) with drug refractory sustained monomorphic VT who underwent transcatheter ablation with high-energy direct-current shocks. One catheter ablation procedure was performed in 10 patients, whereas 2 ablation sessions were necessary in 2 patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed on 2 separate days (mean interval 19). There were 2 baseline studies, 1 several days before ("baseline study I") and the second at the beginning of the ablation procedure ("baseline study II") while the patient was awake and nonsedated. The third programmed stimulation study was done 15 to 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide ("enflurane study"). Rate of sinus rhythm, QRS duration, PQ interval and ventricular effective refractory period were unaltered, whereas QTc interval increased significantly after initiation of anesthesia. Before and after induction of general anesthesia, clinical VT was inducible in all patients. However, in 1 patient, induction of VT was only possible by pacing in the left ventricle after enflurane administration. Based on these data, it is concluded that general anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide has no marked influence on inducibility of clinical VTs. Therefore, this type of anesthesia may be useful for nonpharmacologic, ablative procedures requiring general anesthesia. 
Endometrial adenocarcinoma in Norway. A study of a total population. Fifteen hundred sixty-six patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrioid type (AC) were studied. These accounted for 78.9% of all 1985 patients with confirmed endometrial carcinoma diagnosed in Norway in the period 1970 through 1978. Four hundred and sixty-nine patients (29.9%) had well-differentiated tumors, 677 (43.2%) were moderately and 420 (26.8%) poorly differentiated. Eighty-one percent of the patients had surgicopathologic Stage I disease, 11% Stage II, 6% Stage III, and 2% Stage IV. Mean age at diagnosis was 62.1 years (range, 36 to 91). The crude 5-year and 10-year survival rates for all patients were 74.1% and 62.2%, respectively. Five-year crude survival was 86.8% for Grade 1 and 58.3% for Grade 3 tumors. The 5-year crude survival for patients with intramucosal tumors was 88.7% as opposed to 46.9% for patients with tumors infiltrating to the serosa. Sixty-six percent of the patients with vessel invasion survived for 5 years in contrast to 88.6% for patients without vessel invasion. Histologic grade, myometrial infiltration, vessel invasion, and lymphocyte reaction surrounding the tumor were strongly interrelated. Multivariate analysis showed that the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis was the most important single prognostic factor. Disregarding age, survival in operated patients was more dependent on the depth of myometrial invasion than on grade and stage of disease. 
Pain threshold levels and coping strategies among patients who have chest pain and normal coronary arteries. Patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) tend to show lower pain threshold levels for esophageal balloon distention than do patients with other painful gastrointestinal disorders and healthy controls. The NCCP patients also report greater usage of negative pain-coping strategies, less ability to perform specific behaviors to decrease pain, and higher levels of clinical pain than do other patient and healthy control groups. Behavioral treatments produce significant decreases in pain and disruption of daily activities. Further effort is needed, however, to develop treatments for NCCP that are based on knowledge of the behavioral manifestations of this disorder and the afferent mechanisms involved in perception of visceral pain. 
Periosteal suspension of the lower eyelid and cheek following subciliary exposure of facial fractures. Following craniofacial procedures that involve stripping of the periosteum and soft tissue over the zygomatic maxillary complex, descent of soft tissue with a decrease in anterior projection over the malar area and increase in fullness in the nasolabial fold have been seen to be a problem by these authors. Simple repositioning of the soft tissues to their normal anatomic position may be used to alleviate this problem. 
Noncemented porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty. In 1984, as an alternate to the acrylic fixation of the components of total hip arthroplasty, the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic (PCA) hip system with a beaded porous coating to achieve biologic fixation was initiated. Since then, 44 patients with cementless acetabular components and 35 patients with cementless femoral components have been followed for a minimum of 24 months and an average of 37 months. Harris hip scores averaged 90.5 at most recent follow-up intervals. No reoperations were necessary for failures of fixation or change in position of the acetabular component. Ominous roentgenographic signs such as progressive bead shedding, progressive radiolucencies, or progressive component migration have not occurred. Two femoral component revisions have been necessary: one for intractable pain and one for pain and roentgenographic loosening. Although thigh pain has been prevalent (20%), all patients have been accommodated and have retained stable hip scores. Progressive radiolucencies and progressive implant subsidence have been rare occurrences. The authors continue to use the cementless acetabular component in all cases of total hip arthroplasty in which initial stability can be obtained. It is their preference to cement the femoral component in patients over 65 or when initial stability cannot be achieved. 
Immunologic effects of interferon. Interferons can be defined as a family of induced proteins sharing the capacity to exert pleiotropic effects on cell functions and to render cells resistant to virus infection. They are activating genes coding for a number of enzymes, most of which have not yet been characterized, and also by enhancing the synthesis of cell surface components. This enables interferons to modulate the immune response at different levels. This article will focus on the effects of interferon on antigen presentation, regulation of the immune response, activation of macrophage functions, and on its role in the pathogenesis of some diseases. 
Clinical implications of seizures in neurosarcoidosis. Seizures are a recognized manifestation of neurosarcoidosis, but their clinical relevance is not well established. We reviewed the characteristics, clinical correlations, and prognosis of seizures in 79 patients with neurosarcoidosis. Thirteen (15%) of the 79 patients had seizures, and in eight patients (10%) a seizure was the first manifestation of neurosarcoidosis. These seizures were generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 12 patients (92%) and partial seizures in four patients (31%). The patients with neurosarcoidosis with seizures were more likely to have a progressive or relapsing clinical course and intracranial mass lesions (four patients [31%]), encephalopathy or vasculopathy (eight patients [62%]), or hydrocephalus (five patients [38%]). These central nervous system disorders, rather than the seizures per se, were responsible for most of the serious morbidity and the two deaths (15%) among our patients with seizures. Indeed seizure control was good in 11 (85%) of 13 patients treated with combinations of steroids and antiepileptic medications. Seizures are an important sign in neurosarcoidosis because they are associated with more severe and progressive or relapsing forms of central nervous system sarcoidosis and may be an early manifestation of such disorders. 
Small hepatocellular carcinoma treated with percutaneous ethanol injection: MR imaging findings. Fifty-seven magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were obtained at 0.5 T in 19 patients before and after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for 23 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions less than 3.5 cm in diameter. Seventeen patients also underwent MR imaging 6 months after completion of therapy. In 11 patients, computed tomography was performed before and after treatment. After PEI, fine-needle biopsy specimens were obtained in all cases. Before treatment, HCC lesions had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images in 13 cases, had the same signal intensity as normal liver parenchyma in six, and had high signal intensity in four; all 23 tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. After treatment and at 6-month follow-up, all 21 lesions that contained no malignant cells at fine-needle biopsy had high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and had low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The remaining two HCC lesions in which tumor necrosis was not achieved with PEI displayed a different MR pattern, since the residual neoplastic tissue showed no change in signal intensity on either T1- or T2-weighted images. The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of PEI in achieving tumor regression. 
Nicotine induced gastric injury. A quantitative macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the protective effects of sucralfate and feeding. Nicotine, while an important component of cigarettes, does not cause gross gastric mucosal damage, although its microscopic effect remains unknown. We have evaluated the histology and the microvascular permeability of (a) the effect of nicotine alone or in combination with ethanol on the gastric mucosa of rats and (b) the effect of feeding and sucralfate on the mucosa of rats treated with nicotine and ethanol. Mucosal injury was assessed histologically by the depth of injury and microvascular permeability by the leakage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled albumin. Our results show that nicotine induced microscopic mucosal damage and accentuated the damage induced by alcohol. The damaging effects on mucosa of nicotine and ethanol, alone or in combination, were reduced by pretreatment with sucralfate. Similarly, feeding reduced the degree of mucosal injury. Nicotine and ethanol increased leakage of albumin into the interstitium and the leakage was reduced after sucralfate pretreatment. This study substantiates the adverse effect of smoking on mucosal damage. Vascular factors are probably involved in the pathogenesis. 
Characterization of human renal fibroblasts in health and disease: II. In vitro growth, differentiation, and collagen synthesis of fibroblasts from kidneys with interstitial fibrosis. Fibroblast cultures from normal human kidneys (NKF cells) and kidneys affected with interstitial fibrosis (FKIF cells) were analyzed for in vitro growth, differentiation dynamics, and collagen synthesis. FKIF cells are characterized by hyperproliferative growth, resulting in a prolonged mitotic lifespan, by an altered differentiation pattern, and by the expression of the FKIF cell-specific protein "fibrosin" (molecular weight 53 kd, isoelectric point [pi] 6.1). Furthermore, FKIF cells synthesize four to five times more total collagen per cell as compared with NKF cells, and the relative amounts of the collagen types produced (type I, III, and V) are significantly different from controls. Thus, the in vitro cell system of FKIF cells may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering the induction and progression of renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo. 
Deformity correction and long-term survival in an infant with iniencephaly. Case report. The authors describe the case of a male infant who was diagnosed prenatally as having iniencephaly. Since birth, the child has grown, thrived, and undergone two successful operations to correct his cervical deformity. This case demonstrates that the iniencephaly defect is not uniformly fatal and that neurosurgical intervention may offer significant improvement in the cervical deformity. 
Circadian variation in the frequency of onset of chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. The time of onset of chest pain was studied prospectively in 1154 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with myocardial infarction during a five year period. Statistical analysis confirmed a previous finding in a retrospective study of a bimodal frequency distribution with peaks in the time of onset of chest pain between 2330 and 0030 hours and between 0630 and 0830 hours. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, regional vascular hemodynamics, and the development and prevention of experimental genetic hypertension. During the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) vascular resistance is increased, particularly in the renal circulation, and, to a lesser extent, in the splanchnic bed. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young SHR reverses the renovascular abnormalities more effectively than simple vasodilators, suggesting that the resistance changes may depend on angiotensin II. Perindopril treatment during the development of hypertension causes a reduction in blood pressure as a result of a fall in total peripheral resistance, which persists long after treatment is stopped. These long-term effects can be prevented by replacing angiotensin during perindopril treatment. Not all organs share the long-term resistance changes following perindopril treatment, which are most marked in the renal, splanchnic, and cerebral circulations. The heterogeneous patterns of regional vascular resistance during the development and after prevention of hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in SHR suggest that local factors, for example, angiotensin II related to the tissue renin-angiotensin system or local adrenergic activity, may be important in the genesis of high blood pressure in this genetic model. 
Is premedication with oral glycopyrrolate as effective as oral atropine in attenuating cardiovascular depression in infants receiving halothane for induction of anesthesia? The authors conducted a double-blind study to compare premedication with oral glycopyrrolate and oral atropine in prevention of bradycardia and hypotension during induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O in 90 outpatient infants and children aged 1-18 mo who were randomized into three groups to receive either an oral placebo, oral atropine (0.02 mg/kg), or oral glycopyrrolate (0.05 mg/kg) approximately 1 h before induction of anesthesia. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured before drug administration, just before induction of anesthesia, and every minute until surgical stimulation occurred. Glycopyrrolate, at the dose used, was significantly less effective than atropine in attenuating bradycardia during induction; neither glycopyrrolate nor atropine altered the incidence or degree of hypotension. Antisialagogic activity and side effects were comparable, except for significantly more flushing with atropine. 
Case report: epidural and bilateral retroorbital hematomas complicating sickle cell anemia. Early in the course of a painful crisis, a 19-year-old man with known sickle cell anemia (SCA) developed a clinical picture that resembled either early cavernous sinus thrombosis or retroorbital and bifrontal microinfarcts. A brain computer tomography scan demonstrated bilateral retroorbital hemorrhages along with a left frontal epidural hematoma. In the absence of trauma, thrombocytopenia, or any other detectable hemostatic defect, this type of hemorrhagic manifestation in the setting of SCA has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported in the literature. 
Classic and vigorous achalasia: a comparison of manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings. Compared with classic achalasia, vigorous achalasia has been defined as achalasia with relatively high esophageal contraction amplitudes, often with minimal esophageal dilation and prominent tertiary contractions on radiographs, and with the presence of chest pain. However, no study using current manometric techniques has compared manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings in vigorous and classic achalasia or questioned the usefulness of making this distinction. Fifty-four cases involving patients with achalasia whose radiographic and manometric studies were performed within 6 months of each other were available for review. Patients with vigorous achalasia (n = 17), defined by amplitude greater than or equal to 37 mm Hg, and patients with classic achalasia (n = 37), defined as amplitude less than 37 mm Hg, had substantial overlap in radiographic parameters of esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and tertiary contractions. Manometric properties of repetitive waves and lower esophageal sphincter pressure and clinical aspects of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, and satisfactory responses to pneumatic dilation were similar in both forms of achalasia. A separate analysis of patients with mean contraction amplitude greater than 60 mm Hg revealed similar findings. It is concluded that use of amplitude as a criterion for classifying achalasia is arbitrary and of dubious value. 
Prevalence of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. Obesity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, which are chronic diseases that afflict American Indians and Alaska Natives today. Because American Indians are not represented in most national health and nutrition surveys, there is a paucity of data on actual prevalence of obesity in American Indians. We estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity for American Indian adults, school-age children, and preschool children from existing data. The prevalence of obesity in adults was estimated from self-reported weights and heights obtained from a special survey of American Indians performed as part of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey. Prevalence of obesity in American Indians was 13.7% for men and 16.5% for women, which was higher than the US rates of 9.1% and 8.2%, respectively. Obesity rates in American Indian adolescents and preschool children were higher than the respective rates for US all-races combined. 
Dipyridamole echocardiography test. A new tool for detecting jeopardized myocardium after thrombolytic therapy. BACKGROUND. We wished to assess whether dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET) can detect jeopardized myocardium after thrombolytic therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were treated with 2 million IU urokinase i.v. within 4 hours of the onset of AMI and underwent high-dose (as much as 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) DET 8-10 days after AMI. The results were correlated to the anatomy of the infarct-related vessel (IRV). In patients with positive DET, we evaluated the wall motion score index (WMSI; a semiquantitative integrated estimation of extent and severity of the stress-induced dyssynergy). WMSI was derived by summation of individual segment scores divided by the number of interpreted segments. In a 13-segment model, each segment was assigned a score ranging from 1 (normal) to 4 (dyskinetic). Fifty-three patients had positive results on DET. Of these, 42 had dipyridamole-induced new wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) confined to the infarct zone or adjacent segments. In these patients, mean WMSI increased from 1.46 +/- 0.26 (at resting conditions) to 1.73 +/- 0.35 (at peak dipyridamole) (p less than 0.01), whereas no significant change was detected in negative patients (1.6 +/- 0.34 versus 1.57 +/- 0.34, p = NS). Coronary angiography showed a patent IRV (TIMI grade 2 or 3) in 53 patients and no or minimal reperfusion (TIMI grade 0 or 1) in 23 patients. A patent IRV with critical residual stenosis was found in 35 of 42 patients with dipyridamole-induced WMAs in the infarct zone and in 18 of 34 patients without WMAs (p less than 0.05). Among the 23 patients with occluded IRVs, nine had collateral flow to the distal vessel; six of these had a positive DET. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying a critically stenotic but patent IRV or the presence of a collateral-dependent zone were 66% and 93%, respectively. In a subset of nine patients with a positive DET in the infarct zone or adjacent segments, DET and a control coronary angiography were repeated 1-3 months after an angiographically successful (residual stenosis, 50% or less) coronary angioplasty in the IRV. The repeat DET was negative in eight patients (all with patent IRV at control angiography) and again positive in one patient, who showed restenosis at angiography. The WMSI, at resting conditions was similar before and after angioplasty, whereas it differed significantly at peak dipyridamole (1.7 +/- 0.2 versus 1.4 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. DET can identify the anatomy of the IRV, and dipyridamole-induced WMAs within the infarct zone detect regions with jeopardized myocardium that may benefit from intervention. 
Symptoms associated with tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women. Adjuvant breast cancer therapy with tamoxifen is associated with greater disease-free survival and possibly overall survival. Long-term treatment, possibly of indefinite duration, is being evaluated. Compliance with long-term therapy will depend largely on the nature and severity of tamoxifen's side effects. We evaluated the symptoms associated with tamoxifen therapy in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary node negative breast cancer in remission (mean years since menopause, 9.3) enrolled in a placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study. Tamoxifen recipients reported moderated or severe vasomotor symptoms up to 17%, and gynecologic symptoms up to 4% more frequently than placebo subjects. Persistent vasomotor, gynecologic, or other major side effects were reported by 48% of tamoxifen recipients, and by 21% of placebo subjects. These carefully collected data suggest significant perceived symptom 'cost' of tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women, of a magnitude likely to compromise long-term compliance. 
Prognostic factors in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer: the significance of large bowel obstruction--univariate and multivariate analyses. In order to define prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on data from 113 Japanese patients treated in a typical general hospital in Japan. In the univariate analysis, a poor prognosis was seen in those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in tumors that perforated the visceral peritoneum or that invaded directly other organs or structures (T4), in metastasis to the nodes along the main vascular pedicle (N3), in lymphatic permeation, in blood vessel invasion, in peritoneal dissemination, in Dukes C stage, and in those with lesions presenting with large bowel obstruction. Of these, only lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination had an independent prognostic significance when a multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The significant risk factors related to an obstructing tumor were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were patient's age, nodal involvement and peritoneal dissemination. Since lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination proved significant in both multivariate analyses, we propose that the presence of large bowel obstruction is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinoma. In poor-risk patients who have an obstructing tumor, a staged operation should be attempted for definitive curative surgery. 
Loiasis in endemic and nonendemic populations: immunologically mediated differences in clinical presentation. To define the clinical spectrum of loiasis more precisely and to begin to assess the immunologic basis for the difference in clinical manifestations between visitors to endemic areas and natives of these areas, 51 West African patients with loiasis were evaluated and compared with 42 infected expatriates. Microfilaremia was present in 90% and Calabar swellings in only 16% of the endemic patients. Conversely, only 10% of the expatriates were microfilaremic while 95% complained of Calabar swellings. The endemic population showed significantly decreased levels of peripheral blood eosinophils, parasite-specific IgG, and lymphocyte proliferation to parasite antigens compared with the nonendemic population. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in the modulation of the immune response to parasite antigen are responsible for the observed differences in clinical presentation between expatriate and endemic populations with loiasis. 
Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in elderly patients in a primary care setting. Despite the aging of our population, there remains a paucity of information about gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the elderly. To assess the prevalence and characteristics of GER within this patient population, questionnaires evaluating symptoms associated with GER were administered to 313 consecutive patients 62 yr old or older from a primary care setting. Fourteen percent of these patients reported having at least weekly heartburn. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was accomplished in 54 of the 313 patients surveyed. Twenty percent (11/54) of this subgroup exhibited increased acid contact time (pH less than 4 for more than 6% of the monitoring period). Twenty-two percent (12/54) complained of heartburn, yet only six individuals (11%) exhibited both symptomatic and objective indications of acid reflux. Surprisingly, 31% (17/54) of the patients studied exhibited significant alkalinity within the distal esophagus (pH greater than 8 for greater than 1.5% of the monitoring period). Whereas 29% of these patients (5/17) reported heartburn, 40% of those reporting heartburn (2/5) had acid GER as well as excessive alkalinity. In contrast to patients with acid GER--none of whom reported pulmonary symptoms--24% (4/17) of these patients with esophageal alkalinity reported wheezing, nocturnal cough, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of the four patients with significant distal esophageal exposure to both acid and alkali, two reported heartburn and a third reported dysphagia. In addition to the somewhat higher prevalence of acid reflux than anticipated, a surprisingly high prevalence of esophageal alkalinity was observed. 
Availability and use of hepatitis B vaccine in laboratory and nursing schools in the United States. Hepatitis B is a well-documented occupational hazard for health care workers, including both laboratory and nursing personnel. Since the development of effective hepatitis B vaccines, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) has recommended that health care workers receive the vaccine. In this study, 78 laboratory training programs and 83 nursing training programs were surveyed regarding availability and usage of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine was made available to students in 81 percent of the laboratory programs and 23 percent of the nursing programs. In those programs making the vaccine available, only 59 percent of the laboratory programs and 5 percent of the nursing programs reported a high (greater than 75 percent) use by students. Concern about cost and payment for the vaccine was the most common reason (80 percent) noted by laboratory schools that did not have hepatitis B vaccination programs for students. Of the nursing schools that did not have vaccine programs, 58 percent had not yet considered a program. At laboratory schools with vaccination programs, who paid for the vaccine (hospital or school versus student) was among the most important determinants for vaccine usage by students. These findings point out that some laboratory schools and many nursing schools have not applied the ACIP recommendations to their own programs. Educational efforts and creative payment plans for the vaccine are needed to increase the availability and use of hepatitis B vaccine among laboratory and nursing students. 
Analysis of retroviral sequences in the spinal form of multiple sclerosis. The polymerase chain reaction was used, in a blind study, to look for retroviral sequences in DNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 11 patients with the spinal form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Control subjects consisted of 7 patients with other neurological diseases and 5 healthy blood donors. Three sets of oligonucleotides were used. They could detect all known human oncoretroviruses, lentiviruses, or spumaretroviruses. The primers recognized conserved sequences in the long terminal repeats of the proviral DNA. Control experiments showed that the primers crossreacted within the human immunodeficiency virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus group and that they provided the expected level of sensitivity. Therefore the assay could have detected not only known human retroviruses but also new related members. In spite of this, no retroviral sequences were detected in either the MS or the control specimen. 
A controlled clinical trial of E5 murine monoclonal IgM antibody to endotoxin in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. The XOMA Sepsis Study Group OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of adjunctive monoclonal antibody antiendotoxin immunotherapy in patients with gram-negative sepsis. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Thirty-three university-affiliated centers, including Veterans Affairs, community, and municipal hospitals. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults with signs of gram-negative infection and a systemic septic response. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg of a murine monoclonal antibody directed against gram-negative endotoxin (E5) or placebo. A second infusion was administered 24 hours later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality over the 30-day study period, resolution of organ failures, and safety. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-six patients were enrolled. Three hundred sixteen had confirmed gram-negative sepsis (54% bacteremic, 46% nonbacteremic). The survival difference was not statistically significant for all patients. Among patients with gram-negative sepsis who were not in shock at study entry (n = 137), E5 treatment resulted in significantly greater survival (relative risk, 2.3; P = .01). Resolution of individual organ failures was more frequent among these patients, occurring in 19 (54%) of 35 patients in the E5 group vs eight (30%) of 27 in the placebo group (P = .05). Four reversible allergic reactions occurred among 247 patients (1.6%) receiving E5. No other toxicity was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with E5 antiendotoxin antibody appears safe. It reduces mortality and enhances the resolution of organ failure among patients with gram-negative sepsis who are not in shock when treated. 
Prevention of insulitis and diabetes onset by treatment with complete Freund's adjuvant in NOD mice. In studies of immune cell defects in autoimmune diabetes mellitus, we observed that complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) prevented the onset of diabetes when injected into 8- to 10-wk-old prediabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The prevalence of the onset of diabetes in the CFA-injected versus uninjected NOD mice was 2 of 81 (2.5%) vs. 231 of 379 (61%) among females and 2 of 44 (4.5%) vs. 83 of 336 (25%) among males, respectively. The incidence of histologically identifiable insulitis was significantly reduced in CFA-treated prediabetic female NOD mice (18%) compared with the incidence in female age-matched controls (70%). Splenocytes or Mac-(1+)-enriched splenocytes from CFA-treated NOD mice, when cotransferred with splenocytes from diabetic mice, reduced the incidence of diabetes provoked by diabetic splenocytes in vivo. In the spleen, CFA injection induced sustained increases in cell proliferation and an associated major increase in the numbers of an immature cell type that expressed the Mac-1 surface antigen. In CFA-treated NOD mice, lymphocytes derived from the spleen failed to respond in vitro to stimulation by the mitogen concanavalin A or by anti-CD3. When cocultured, Mac-1+ cells, enriched from the splenocytes of CFA-treated mice, suppressed concanavalin A- or anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T lymphocytes derived from either the spleen or thymus of untreated NOD mice. Therefore, treatment with CFA prevents the development of diabetes, and concomitantly, insulitis while stimulating the generation of splenic suppressor cells that are capable of suppressing diabetogenic T-lymphocyte function in vivo and in vitro. 
Intermittent injection vs patient-controlled analgesia for sickle cell crisis pain. Comparison in patients in the emergency department. BACKGROUND.--The purpose of this study is a prospective assessment of morphine sulfate administration by intermittent intravenous (IV) injections (Int-IV) vs patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients in the emergency department (ED) with sickle cell crisis pain. METHODS.--Patients were at bed rest and received intravenous hydration. Linear analog scale for pain intensity and verbal pain scale, level of alertness, and vital signs were assessed prior to therapy, every 60 minutes thereafter, and at the time of discharge from the ED. Patients were randomized to Int-IV or PCA. During phase 1, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 4 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 2 mg bolus then 1.0 mg with a 6-minute lockout. During phase 2, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 8 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 5 mg bolus then 2.7 mg with a 10-minute lockout. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test, general linear modeling, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi 2 test. RESULTS.--During phase 1, 10 patients (28.3 +/- 7.3 years) received Int-IV and 10 patients (33.9 +/- 12.5 years) received PCA. Treatment groups did not differ significantly regarding duration of pain, amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, level of alertness, or vital signs except for a significantly lower final respiratory rate with Int-IV. In phase 2, 12 patients (28.4 +/- 5.6 years) received Int-IV and 13 patients (26.8 +/- 8.1 years) received PCA. The PCA groups had a significantly shorter elapsed time between onset of pain and treatment (7.3 +/- 6.5 hours) when compared with the Int-IV group (18 +/- 16.9 hours). Treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to total amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, vital signs, or level of alertness. The PCA group had a significant reduction in length of stay in the ED during phase 2 when compared with phase 1. The ED discharge rate and the incidence of side effects did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION.--At both the low- and high-dose regimens, PCA is equally safe and effective and may be used in place of Int-IV administration of morphine in the ED treatment of sickle cell crisis pain. 
Alcohol consumption of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation. We studied the recent alcohol consumption and other possible precipitating factors in 99 consecutive patients (53 men and 46 women) all under 65 years of age with sustained re-entry and automatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and compared them with those of two groups of controls. One control group was derived from the Emergency Room patients and matched for age and sex; the other group (44 men, 22 women, mean age 48.7 years) was randomly selected from the general out-of-hospital population. There were 50 patients with supraventricular tachycardia, 30 with atrial flutter, and 19 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Coronary heart disease (14% of patients), hypertension (10%), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases associated with the arrhythmias. The self-reported alcohol consumption of patients with arrhythmias during the week preceding the arrhythmia did not differ significantly from that of hospital or population controls, although significantly more patients than controls had liver enzyme levels above normal; neither were there any significant differences between the groups regarding prevalence for alcoholism as judged by the CAGE questionnaire. The results were essentially similar when patients with supraventricular tachycardia and those with intra-atrial tachyarrhythmias (flutter and paroxysmal tachycardia) were separately compared with the controls. We conclude that alcohol consumption, although a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, is not associated with the induction of other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients of working age. 
Mineral spirits inhalation associated with hemolysis, pulmonary edema, and ventricular fibrillation. A previously healthy 42-year-old woman developed severe dyspnea, chest discomfort, and malaise several hours after prolonged exposure to concentrated vapors from mineral spirits. On the way to the hospital, she sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest; on arrival several minutes later, she was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was resuscitated. Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities. It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits. It is important that physicians be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on presentation and to warn patients of the risk of such toxic exposure. 
Refractory chronic bacterial prostatitis: a re-evaluation of ciprofloxacin treatment after a median followup of 30 months. A total of 16 men suffering from refractory chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Escherichia coli was treated with ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks. After a median followup of 30 months (range 21 to 36 months) 10 of the 16 patients were considered cured as judged by bacteriological results and clinical symptoms. In 2 men a second ciprofloxacin regimen obviously showed success also. In 2 patients ciprofloxacin therapy failed and in 2 therapy had to be discontinued due to side effects of the central nervous system. 
Prevention and treatment of pregnancy-associated hypertension: what have we learned in the last 10 years? High blood pressure (BP) complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy falls into four categories: (1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, (2) chronic hypertension of whatever cause, (3) preeclampsia-eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension or renal disease, and (4) transient or late hypertension (gestational hypertension). Preeclampsia, the association of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, accounts for more than 50% of all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, distinguishing between preeclampsia and other causes of hypertension on clinical grounds can be difficult because of the lack of specific tests for differential diagnosis. Increased vascular resistance has been claimed as the primary cause of preeclampsia; however, a variable hemodynamic profile with relatively high cardiac outputs, normal filling pressures, and inappropriately high systemic vascular resistances is now reported by most investigators. Imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor eicosanoids may account for platelet activation and increased responsiveness to pressor peptides. Altered prostacyclin (PGI2) to thromboxane A2 (TxA2) ratio in maternal uteroplacental vascular bed may favor local platelet activation and vasoconstriction contributing to placental insufficiency and fetal distress. Alternatively, recent evidence seems to suggest that fetal umbilical placental circulation may be the site of the primary vascular injury. Whether low-dose aspirin prevents preeclampsia because it inhibits the excessive maternal TxA2 or whether the partial inhibition of fetal TxA2 is also of therapeutic value remains to be established. Treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is probably important to prevent cardiac failure or cerebrovascular accidents in the mother. The need for pharmacological therapy of mild to moderate hypertension is still debated, since no formal studies are available to clarify whether pharmacological treatment in such instances effectively reduces maternal or fetal risk. For the treatment of preeclampsia, hydralazine and nifedipine may be used when delivery is not applicable. Labetalol and diazoxide are effective for hypertensive emergencies. Life-threatening hypertension that does not respond to more conventional therapy is an indication for the use of sodium nitroprusside. For chronic hypertension, alpha-methyldopa remains the treatment of choice; if ineffective, hydralazine or beta-blockers are suitable. Effectiveness and safety of other molecules remain elusive. 
Desmoplastic small cell tumors of the peritoneum coexpressing mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Desmoplastic small cell tumors arising diffusely within the abdomen and lacking an apparent organ of origin are rare. Most previously reported cases occurred in children, but young adult patients also have been described. Light microscopic examination shows the tumors to be composed of nests of small cells surrounded by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical findings reveal multidirectional differentiation with coexpression of cytokeratin, milk fat globule, neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7, desmin, and vimentin. Electron microscopic examination demonstrates paranuclear condensations of intermediate filaments. The authors describe two patients who died of their disease, despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical intervention. 
Ethnic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales. OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade. 
Botulinum toxin treatment of tremors. We report the results of an open trial of botulinum toxin (Botox) in the treatment of 51 patients with disabling tremors, classified as dystonic (14), essential (12), combination of dystonic and essential (22), parkinsonian (1), peripherally induced (1), and midbrain (1). The average age of the patients was 55.8 years, and duration of symptoms was 13.9 years. During a total of 160 treatment visits, an average of 242 +/- 75 units of Botox was injected per visit in cervical muscles of 42 patients with head tremor and 95 +/- 38 in forearm muscles of 10 patients with hand tremor; one patient was injected in both. The average peak effect for all patients was rated as 3.0 (0 to 4 scale). Thirty-five (67%) patients improved (peak effect greater than or equal to 1). The average latency from injection to response was 6.8 days, and the average duration of maximum improvement was 10.5 weeks. Local complications, lasting an average of 20.6 days, were noted in 17 (40%) patients injected for head tremor, consisting chiefly of dysphagia in 12 (29%), transient neck weakness in four (10%), and local pain in two (5%). Six (60%) patients with hand tremor had transient focal weakness. EMG recordings showed decreased amplitude of EMG bursts after Botox treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that Botox injections can be used to control tremor in patients in whom other forms of therapy have failed. 
Chickenpox pneumonia, its complications and management. A report of three cases, including the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We report three cases of chickenpox pneumonia in adults, all of whom required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. One patient developed a variety of complications, and another, a pregnant woman, required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
A prospective evaluation of the effect of tumor cell DNA content on recurrence in colorectal cancer. Tumor cell DNA (ploidy) content was measured prospectively in samples from 320 patients resected for colorectal cancer with a minimum follow-up time of 2 years. All patients were followed and those with recurrence were investigated carefully. There was no correlation between tumors with an abnormal cellular DNA content (aneuploid or tetraploid) and patient age, sex, tumor site, pathologic stage, or histologic grade. In 236 patients who underwent potentially curative operations, 75 (32%) had local and/or distant recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher (test statistic, 4.3; P = 0.04) for those patients with aneuploid tumors (52 of 142, 37%) compared with those with diploid tumors (23 of 94, 24%). The subgroups of patients where ploidy exerted an effect were in patients with Stage B tumors or mobile tumors and in patients over 65 years of age. Further analysis showed that there was a twofold increase in local recurrence and a threefold increase in distant recurrence in patients with aneuploid tumors, but no excess of patients who had both local and distant recurrence. Measurement of DNA ploidy can identify a group of patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer at high risk for recurrence. In combination with clinicopathologic factors, DNA ploidy may be useful in analyzing the results of trials and in planning adjuvant therapy. 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Gene deletions force nonsecretory alpha-chain disease plasma cells to produce membrane-form alpha-chain only. We studied a case of nonsecretory alpha-chain disease. The proliferating plasma cells contained a short transcript coding for a truncated membrane-form alpha 1-chain. The productive alpha-gene bore several noncontiguous deletions affecting the VHDJH and CH1 regions. Two deletions were accompanied with peculiar insertions containing duplications. The first insertion contained an acceptor splice site and was present in part in the mature transcript, thus coding for an abnormal aminoterminal peptide. Another deletion located 3' to CH3 eliminated the polyadenylation site of secreted-form alpha-mRNA. As a result, only membrane-form alpha mRNA was present in the tumoral plasma cells, thus explaining the nonsecretory phenotype of the disease. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences showed that the previously undescribed human alpha membrane region is encoded by a single exon, beginning with two alternate acceptor splice sites, and comprises either 65 or 71 amino acids. 
Anterior sternal retraction for reoperative median sternotomy. The incidence of reoperative median sternotomy for repeat cardiac surgery is increasing. Reoperative median sternotomy is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality than first-time cardiac surgery. A portion of this morbidity and mortality may be due to direct injury to the heart and great vessels in the process of reopening the sternum. We report a new technique utilizing anterior sternal retraction that allows division of adhesions between the undersurface of the sternum and the heart and great vessels under direct vision. This technique enables the surgeon to minimize the risk of serious injury to these underlying structures during reoperative cardiac surgery. 
Physical overdistension converts ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property and regulate ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide production. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is present in adult atria but at very low concentrations in normal adult mammalian ventricles. In the atria, the production of ANP is regulated by physical distension of the atrial wall. The same phenomenon was investigated in the ventricles of rats and men. Cardiac tissues from human ventricular aneurysm (n = 5), spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 30), and rats that had overloaded left ventricles induced by surgery (n = 84) were studied with the methods of light microscopic immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic immunogold staining, and RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. It was found that the levels of ANP gene expression, ANP immunoreactivity, and ANP-containing specific granules in the overburdened ventricles were elevated and their degrees of fluctuation were directly proportional to the force of physical distension applied to the ventricular cardiomyocytes. In rats, ANP mRNA and ANP immunoreactivity returned to the control level seven days after the ventricular overload was surgically released. The changes of ANP and its mRNA in the ventricles were related more closely to the changes of intraventricular pressure than to cardiocytic hypertrophy. In addition, ANP immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Purkinje cells and periarteriolar cardiomyocytes in the ventricles of normotensive rats. In conclusion, physical overstretch of the ventricle wall is likely to be the triggering factor affecting ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property, and also to regulate the production of ventricular ANP, thereby contributing to the control of the blood volume and the blood pressure. 
Functional outcomes of children with sickle-cell disease affected by stroke. The nature and degree of functional recovery after stroke in children with sickle-cell disease (SCD) has not been extensively investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the functional status of 14 SCD children who had had strokes and to compare them with age-matched and gender-matched SCD children who had not had strokes. By doing so, we would be able to quantify the eventual physical and cognitive functional outcomes of survivors of stroke secondary to SCD and assess the impact of stroke on these patients. These children (five boys and nine girls) with SCD and stroke(s) were 11.6 +/- 4.3 years of age (range five to 18 years). They experienced one to three strokes at a mean age of 6.1 +/- 5.2 years (range one to 17 years). A series of tests were administered to these subjects to evaluate physical and psychosocial functions. These tests were performed at least one year after the latest stroke. This study showed that all of the SCD-stroke children were physically independent. Only a few had impairments of hand functions and mild difficulties in self-care activities. However, most of these children demonstrated intellectual deficits ranging from borderline to moderate mental retardation, reduced language functions ranging from low normal to retarded range, and problems in adjustment. Intelligence quotient of the children with SCD-stroke(s) was significantly lower than those of age-matched and gender-matched nonstroke SCD children, suggesting that stroke caused an adverse effect on the cognitive functioning of these children. The results indicate that in the SCD-stroke children psychosocial deficits outweighed physical disabilities. 
Acute appendicitis. A 5-year review. A startling 31 per cent rate of perforated appendicitis in 1984 prompted a 5-year review at the Guthrie Medical Center. An increase over previous rates of 13 per cent and 0 per cent in 1964 and 1944 was confirmed in this study. Perforation accompanied 44 of 240 cases of appendicitis (18.3%); diagnostic accuracy in 295 cases undergoing operation was 81.4 per cent. Groups at risk for perforation were patients in the first decade of life (34.3% with perforations) and those over 50 years of age (48% perforated). Perforation rates were generally inversely related to accuracy. Accuracy was poorest in women in the second to fourth decade or those in the mid-portion of the menstrual cycle. When the appendix was not perforated, complications occurred in 8.7 per cent of patients while 29.5 per cent with a perforation had a complication. The mean hospital stay was prolonged by 2.5 days if the appendix was perforated. An increased awareness of the risk by both the public and physicians is essential to reduce the number of perforations. 
Intrarenal pressure following pyeloplasty or percutaneous surgery. In a study of 37 patients it was shown that recording the intrapelvic pressure is a safe and reliable means of judging the best time to remove a nephrostomy tube. No post-operative complications were encountered and the procedure has the added advantage of avoiding the use of X-rays. 
Oncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx. Oncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx has been infrequently described, with only two previous cases in the literature. With the advent of panendoscopy during the last decade, however, a better understanding of this histopathologic diagnosis is desirable. Thirty-three cases are reviewed, with thirty occurring in the nasopharynx. This was most commonly discovered as an unrelated finding during endoscopic evaluation of a head and neck mass or malignancy in twenty-two patients, either histologically after random biopsy or after biopsy of small but visible lesions. An additional eight cases manifested otitis media or eustachian tube dysfunction. The histology, terminology, and benign clinical nature of these lesions are discussed. 
Pituitary hyperplasia and gigantism in mice caused by a cholera toxin transgene. Cyclic AMP is thought to act as an intracellular second messenger, mediating the physiological response of many cell types to extracellular signals. In the pituitary, growth hormone (GH)-producing cells (somatotrophs) proliferate and produce GH in response to hypothalamic GH-releasing factor, which binds a receptor that stimulates Gs protein activation of adenylyl cyclase. We have now determined whether somatotroph proliferation and GH production are stimulated by cAMP alone, or require concurrent, non-Gs-mediated induction of other regulatory molecules by designing a transgene to induce chronic supraphysiological concentrations of cAMP in somatotrophs. The rat GH promoter was used to express an intracellular form of cholera toxin, a non-cytotoxic and irreversible activator of Gs. Introduction of this transgene into mice caused gigantism, elevated serum GH levels, somatotroph proliferation and pituitary hyperplasia. These results support the direct triggering of these events by cAMP, and illustrate the utility of cholera toxin transgenes as a tool for physiological engineering. 
Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve in the fetus: a report of two cases. Because they had irreversible damage to the left ventricular myocardium none of 12 patients with critical aortic stenosis diagnosed prenatally survived after postnatal treatment. This experience prompted three attempts at intrauterine balloon dilatation of the aortic valve in two fetuses with this condition. On each attempt the balloon catheter was successfully delivered to the left ventricle. In the first fetus the aortic valve was not crossed and the fetus died the next day. In the second fetus the balloon was correctly positioned across the aortic valve and inflated in the valve ring. After delivery, a further balloon angioplasty was performed; this relieved the stenosis but the patient died five weeks later from persisting left ventricular dysfunction related to endocardial fibroelastosis. Balloon angioplasty is feasible in fetal life but the prognosis depends on the ability of the relief of stenosis to limit, prevent, or allow regression of left ventricular damage before delivery. 
New method for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. A new technique is described for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. This method requires only a short period of general anesthesia to drain the periesophageal abscess by a drainage tube inserted into the abscess cavity from the esophagus with the aid of a gastroscope and fluoroscopy. Gastric fluids are diverted from the esophageal rupture with a gastrostomy, and a jejunostomy is used for enteral feeding. The esophagus is retained, and closure of the fistula with resumption of normal swallowing is documented with serial sinograms. 
Alfentanil for urgent caesarean section in a patient with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. We present the case of a parturient with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension who received general anaesthesia using alfentanil for urgent Caesarean section. Alfentanil promoted haemodynamic stability and allowed immediate postoperative extubation. Epidural morphine provided postoperative analgesia. This combination permitted early ambulation and prevention of thromboembolism. A disadvantage of this technique, neonatal respiratory depression, was promptly reversed with a single dose of naloxone. The anaesthetic management of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is discussed and the neonatal pharmacokinetics of maternally administered alfentanil are presented. 
Homozygosity for a newly identified missense mutation in a patient with very severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). We have identified a previously unrecognized missense mutation in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). The mutation is a G646-to-A transition at a CG dinucleotide and predicts a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 216. Computer analysis of secondary structure predicts a major alteration with loss of a beta-pleated sheet in a highly conserved region of the protein. The basepair substitution also generates a new site for the restriction enzyme BstXI in exon 7 of the genomic DNA. Digestion of genomic DNA from the patient and from his parents revealed that he was homozygous for the mutation and that his mother and father were carriers. This mutation in homozygous form appears to be associated with very severe disease, since the patient had perinatal onset of clinical manifestations of SCID, the highest concentration of the toxic metabolite deoxyATP in nine patients studied, and a relatively poor immunologic response during the initial 2 years of therapy with polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase. Analysis of DNA from 21 additional patients with ADA-SCID and from 19 unrelated normals revealed that, while none of the normal individuals showed the abnormal restriction fragment, two of the 21 patients studied were heterozygous for the G646-to-A mutation. 
Spontaneous abdominal arteriovenous fistulae: report of eight cases and review of the literature. The spontaneous rupture of an abdominal aneurysm into an adjacent major vein results in a profound and rapidly worsening haemodynamic disturbance. Survival depends on prompt diagnosis and closure of the fistula at operation. Eight cases are reported and modes of presentation, diagnostic criteria and management principles are reviewed in a detailed analysis of 148 cases in the English literature. 
Hypoxaemia after nebulised salbutamol in wheezy infants: the importance of aerosol acidity. The effect of nebulised iso-osmolar, preservative free, but acidic salbutamol solution was studied in 34 acutely wheezing infants aged 1-17 months. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) fell significantly during the first five minutes after nebulisation with further deterioration at 15-20 minutes. Ten of these infants were followed up for another two hours and showed slight improvement. Even after the second hour TcPO2 had not reached baseline values. Three months later the response to salbutamol and a placebo of equal acidity (pH 3.9) was studied in 11 infants from the same group, now free of symptoms. Lung function tests were included and showed no significant changes in specific conductance and volume corrected maximum expiratory flows (Vmax at functional residual capacity/thoracic gas volume). However, hypoxaemia occurred after the acidic placebo with a significant drop of TcPO2 (mean 0.9 kPa); SO2 decreased similarly but this did not reach significance. After salbutamol there was a further significant deterioration of mean TcPO2 (1.4 kPa) and of SO2. These results show that beside a possible pharmacological effect of salbutamol the acidity of the aerosol also induces hypoxaemia in infants. 
Noninvasive quantification of regional myocardial blood flow in coronary artery disease with oxygen-15-labeled carbon dioxide inhalation and positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND. Oxygen-15-labeled water is a diffusible, metabolically inert myocardial blood flow tracer with a short half-life (2 minutes) that can be used quantitatively with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to validate a new technique to quantify myocardial blood flow (MBF) in animals and to assess its application in patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The technique involves the administration of 15O-labeled carbon dioxide (C15O2) and rapid dynamic scanning. Arterial and myocardial time activity curves were fitted to a single tissue compartment tracer kinetic model to estimate MBF in each myocardial region. Validation studies consisted of 52 simultaneous measurements of MBF with PET and gamma-labeled microspheres in nine closed-chest dogs over a flow range of 0.5-6.1 ml/g/min. A good correlation between the two methods was obtained (y = 0.36 + 1.0x, r = 0.91). Human studies consisted of 11 normal volunteers and eight patients with chronic stable angina and single-vessel disease, before and after intravenous dipyridamole infusion. In the normal group, MBF was homogeneous throughout the left ventricle both at rest and after administration of dipyridamole (0.88 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min and 3.52 +/- 1.12 ml/g/min, respectively; p less than or equal to 0.001). In patients, resting MBF was similar in the distribution of the normal and stenotic arteries (1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.93 +/- 0.21 ml/g/min, respectively). After dipyridamole infusion, MBF in normally perfused areas increased to 2.86 +/- 0.83 ml/g/min, whereas in the regions supplied by stenotic arteries it increased to only 1.32 +/- 0.27 ml/g/min (p less than or equal to 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. PET with C15O2 inhalation provides an accurate noninvasive quantitative method for measuring regional myocardial blood flow in patients. 
Steps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. 
Uncompacted inner myelin lamellae in inherited tendency to pressure palsy. Nerves in patients with inherited tendency to pressure palsy (ITPP) are susceptible to degrees of traction or compression which in nonaffected persons do not induce neuropathic symptoms or deficits, conduction block of fibers, or electromyographic changes characteristic of the disorder. Two observations suggest a widespread asymptomatic abnormality of nerves: 1) low conduction velocity of clinically unaffected nerves, and 2) focal thickenings (tomacula) on teased myelinated fibers of clinically unaffected sural nerves. Sural nerves from five patients and five healthy subjects were assessed for morphologic abnormality in ITPP that might account for the susceptibility of nerves to compression. Teased nerve fibers showed a higher frequency of segmental demyelination or remyelination, or both (p less than 0.003). The mean frequency of fibers showing focal myelin thickenings was 57 +/- 10% in ITPP and 0% in controls. In electron micrographs, regions of uncompacted myelin lamellae, usually affecting the innermost lamellae and extending for a variable distance averaging 9 +/- 4 microns were seen in 11 +/- 4% of fibers in ITPP. None were found in the control nerves. The finding of uncompacted myelin lamellae may suggest an abnormality of myelin composition or of interaction of Schwann cells and axons accounting for the increased susceptibility to pressure palsy, tomaculous formation, or demyelination. From electron microscopic evaluation of serial skip sections we infer that myelin of tomaculae is in continuity with internodal myelin and is reduplicated (full-thickness or cleaved layers are longitudinally or circumferentially folded-back on themselves). 
Molecular characterization of the mouse mannose-binding proteins. The mannose-binding protein A but not C is an acute phase reactant. Mannose-binding proteins play a role in first line host defense against a variety of pathogens. We report the molecular cloning of two mouse mannose-binding proteins designated A and C based on their close identity with their rat homologues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse mannose-binding proteins, as with rat and the human forms, have an NH2 terminus that is rich in cysteine that stabilizes a collagen alpha helix followed by a carboxyl- terminal carbohydrate binding domain. We further show that the mouse mannose-binding protein A mRNA, as with the human, is induced like the acute phase reactant serum amyloid P protein, yet the expression of mouse mannose-binding protein C mRNA is not regulated above its low baseline level. The expression of both mannose-binding proteins A and C mRNA is restricted to the liver under basal and stress conditions. 
Chagas' cardioneuropathy: effect of ganglioside treatment in chronic dysautonomic patients--a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. To date, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment for Chagas' cardioneuropathy, one of the most common causes of congestive heart failure and sudden death in the world. Fifty-eight adults with positive serology for Chagas' disease and abnormal autonomic nervous system tests participated in this placebo-controlled clinical trial with Cronassial (mixed gangliosides), 40 mg daily intramuscular injection for 4 or 8 weeks. We measured postural response (heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure changes in response to standing); heart rate changes induced by cough and hyperventilation reflex tests; dizziness on standing; number of stress-induced arrhythmias; and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive T-lymphocyte percentage in blood samples. Cronassial is safe and significantly improves systolic blood pressure (p = 0.050) and double product responses to postural stress (p = 0.028), hyperventilation heart rate response (p = 0.007), frequency of dizziness episodes (p less than 0.001), number of arrhythmias (p = 0.033), and percentage of PAS-positive T-lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. 
Biliary patency imaging after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy with gallbladder in situ. Clinical impact of nonvisualization. We prospectively performed nuclear biliary patency imaging (HIDA scanning) in 62 patients who had undergone endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy for management of pancreaticobiliary disease with their gallbladders in situ. Elective cholecystectomy was not recommended because of advanced age, comorbidity, or absence of gallstones. All patients had patent cystic ducts at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography balloon cholangiography. Eighteen (29.1%) of 62 patients had nonvisualizing HIDA scans, and in 44 (70.9%) of 62 visualization was normal or delayed. Six cholecystectomies were required for colic (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 4), and acute cholecystocholedochal fistula with cholangitis (n = 1). Among the patients with cholelithiasis and nonvisualization (n = 13), five (38.5%) required surgery, whereas only one (4.8%) of 21 patients with cholelithiasis and visualization required surgery. Nonvisualizing HIDA scans are frequent (30%) after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy and have no clinical relevance in patients without cholelithiasis but predict the need for cholecystectomy within 16 months in 38.5% of patients with cholelithiasis. 
Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. 
High-dose melphalan with 6-hydroxydopamine-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation for poor-risk neuroblastoma. Long-term results are presented of 28 patients who were diagnosed with neuroblastoma at more than 12 months of age and who received melphalan 180 mg/m2 (n = 6) or 240 mg/m2 (n = 22) to consolidate remissions of Stage IV disease or to control refractory disease. Twenty-four patients also received dianhydrogalactitol 180 to 240 mg/m2, and 11 received total body irradiation 450 to 600 cGy. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed with marrow that was unpurged (n = 2) or purged ex vivo (n = 26) with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) 20 micrograms/ml plus ascorbate 200 micrograms/ml. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microliters was 21 days and to self-sustaining platelet counts more than 20,000/microliters, 28 days. One patient required infusion of unpurged reserve marrow. Two groups of patients underwent ABMT: (1) 17 patients (Group I) who were in first remission a median of 7 months after diagnosis; and (2) 11 patients (Group II) who had refractory disease or were in second remission. For Group I, event-free survival was 29% at 12 months and 6% at 24 months post-ABMT. All Group II patients died of disease or ABMT-related toxicity. Overall, of the 28 patients, one is a long-term relapse-free survivor; five died of ABMT-related toxicity; ten patients with tumors present at ABMT had progressive disease within 6 months of ABMT; and 12 patients with no measurable disease at ABMT relapsed 4 to 32 months (median, 12) post-ABMT. Among the latter, six relapses involved the primary site, and six were restricted to distant sites. These results--in accord with the long-term outcome in other series--suggest that for neuroblastoma high-dose melphalan cannot be relied on to ablate residual disease or to salvage patients with refractory tumors. In addition, the pattern of relapse in several patients could be explained by infusion of incompletely purged autografts; this would support recent laboratory evidence that 6-OHDA/ascorbate is a suboptimal purging method. 
Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. 
Time spent caregiving and help received by spouses and adult children of brain-impaired adults. Caregivers for brain-impaired adults differ in living arrangements, amount of time spent giving care, and assistance received from family and friends and from paid help depending on their kin relationship and employment status. Spousal caregivers devote large amounts of time to caregiving, and husbands spend no less time than wives. Most caregivers receive little assistance from other family members and friends, but husbands receive more than others. Employed spouses receive more paid help than those without jobs, but employment does not affect the amount of paid help received by adult daughters. 
Epilepsy and brain tumors: implications for treatment. Primary intraparenchymal tumors of the brain are important etiologic factors in partial or focal epilepsy. Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment. Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free. Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome. Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex. Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions. Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy. 
Labyrinthitis ossificans: histopathologic consideration for cochlear implantation. Labyrinthitis ossificans may be a hindrance to cochlear implantation by making electrode insertion difficult. We performed a histopathologic study of 24 temporal bones with labyrinthitis ossificans from multiple causes. The organ of Corti was graphically reconstructed and the degree of obstruction was estimated for each millimeter of the cochlea. Correlations were calculated between the degree of new bone formation and the cause, patient's age and sex, and time from the original temporal bone insult. Our results demonstrate that complete cochlear ossification is rare. The scala tympani in the basal turn of the cochlea is the most frequent area of ossification, regardless of the cause of the labyrinthitis ossificans. Meningogenic labyrinthitis, usually a childhood disease, was associated with the greatest amount of ossification. When ossification resulted from tympanogenic labyrinthitis, the scala tympani was completely ossified near the round window niche in all temporal bones. Neo-ossification of the basal turn associated with otosclerosis was limited to the proximal 6 mm of the scala tympani in all cases. Three temporal bones had a patent round window niche and basal turn, but significant apical and middle-turn ossification. Peripheral sensorineural elements were severely degenerated in the region of the ossification in all specimens, and spiral ganglion cell counts were decreased. 
Fume fever and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome in a welder. I have reported a case of fume fever and concurrent reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) after welding. The RADS should be added to the list of potential hazards associated with welding. 
Carcinoma (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumor) of the uterus and ovary. Correlation of clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features in 29 cases. We examined the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of a series of 23 endometrial, five cervical, and one ovarian carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumors) and nine associated distant peritoneal metastases. The primary tumors all showed epithelial differentiation (cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen expression) of the carcinomatous component, while sarcomatous areas showed epithelial differentiation in all but one case. The metastases showed uniform staining for cytokeratin (eight of eight cases) and epithelial membrane antigen (eight of eight cases), including the spindle cell component that was present in four of nine cases. Desmin significantly changed the interpretation of rhabdomyosarcoma differentiation by refuting putative rhabdomyoblasts in two cases and identifying rhabdomyoblasts in two other cases where they were unrecognized on hematoxylineosin staining. S100 protein was positive in all five cases with chondrosarcoma differentiation. Muscle-specific actin and vimentin were positive in the sarcomatous component of all cases and in the carcinomatous component of seven and 10 cases, respectively. After immunostaining, heterologous elements were present in 18 of 29 cases (11 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, three cases of chondrosarcoma, three cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma and chondrosarcoma, and one case of liposarcoma). Only six of 27 patients with follow-up were disease free for 12 months or longer (associated with stage I or II disease, smaller size, no lymphatic invasion in the resection specimen, and no invasion of the outer two thirds of myometrium). Presence and type of heterologous elements, grade of sarcomatous or carcinomatous components, histologic type of carcinomatous component, gross appearance, presence of necrosis, or use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not affect outcome. Carcinosarcomas are clinically aggressive distinctive mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms with histologic and immunohistochemical features that overlap with metaplastic carcinoma in many cases. 
Cytokines and the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis: Borrelia burgdorferi induces glioma cells to secrete interleukin-6. Lyme disease is a multisystemic disease caused by a tickborne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. Neuroborreliosis is characterized by intrathecal production of antibodies specific for the spirochete. This suggests that spirochetal infection of the central nervous system produces conditions that support the maturation of B lymphocytes to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulates B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells. The present study was undertaken to determine whether B. burgdorferi can stimulate cells of central nervous system origin to secrete IL-6. C6 rat glioma cells cultured with spirochetes induced secretion of IL-6 activity. Peak stimulation was achieved at 24 h with 25 spirochetes per glioma cell. Glioma cells were also stimulated to produce IL-6 by interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. That very few spirochetes are found in Lyme disease patients suggests that biologic amplification factors derived from the organism or the host, or both, are responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. IL-6 can now be added to the growing list of such factors. 
Cataract extraction after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid. Thirteen eyes of 55 consecutive patients treated with brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid developed postirradiation cataracts. Cataract development was more common in older patients and in patients with larger and more anterior tumors. Eleven eyes had extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Initial visual improvement occurred in 91% of eyes, with an average improvement of 5.5 lines. Visual acuity was maintained at 20/60 or better in 55% of the eyes over an average period of follow-up of 24 months (range, 6 to 40 months). These data suggest that, visually, cataract extraction can be helpful in selected patients who develop a cataract after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid. 
Familial aneurysms of the interventricular septum. Congenital aneurysms of the interventricular septum were found in a 29 year old man and his four year old son. Both were symptom free. In both, M mode and cross sectional echocardiography showed an aneurysm in the mid-muscular trabecular portion of the ventricular septum with considerable paradoxical motion of the aneurysmal segment. Otherwise the chamber dimensions, intracardiac structures, and cardiac function were normal for age. Congenital aneurysm of the interventricular septum is rare and these familial cases may be unique. 
Clinical significance of aortic graft dilation. To determine if there is a relationship between aortic graft dilation and graft complications, 443 serial ultrasound studies performed on 106 patients were analyzed. Of 443 studies, 243 were done retrospectively on 59 patients from 3 to 144 months (mean, 38 months) after graft implantation. Forty-seven additional patients were studied prospectively, with direct measurement of external graft diameter after aortic clamp release. Subsequent ultrasound examinations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually (n = 200) were routinely performed. Mean follow-up was 12 months (range, 3 to 48). Knitted double velour Dacron prostheses were used in all cases reported in this study. This cohort was culled from our ongoing graft surveillance program, which includes grafts of other materials and manufacturers. Comparison of the manufacturer's recorded box size with follow-up ultrasound measurements in all cases demonstrated a mean increase in graft diameter of 3.7 mm (23%). Little dilation occurred after 1 year. In 47 patients with direct graft diameter measurements taken after declamping, an immediate mean increase of 1.7 mm (11%) was noted. Dilation was not related to surgical indication (aneurysm vs occlusive disease) or hypertension. Analysis of the 10% segment of the series with the greatest dilation (mean, 39%) did not demonstrate a predilection for graft complications. No significant dilation was noted in the single cases encountered of femoral and iliac anastomotic aneurysms and perigraft seroma. Although dilation of knitted Dacron grafts is to be anticipated, no association between graft dilation and graft complications was found in this series. 
Electrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are "at risk for" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. 
Natural history and prognostic variables in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The clinical features at the time of presentation and the outcome in 126 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied to clarify the natural history and prognosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The median age of the patients at the time of presentation was 36 years, 62% were male, and 16% were asymptomatic. The median follow-up from time of presentation was 5.8 years. There were more patients who had liver transplants (21%) than patients who died of liver-related disease (16%); the estimated median survival to these end points was 12 years. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 8 patients and in 23% of those undergoing liver transplantation. Asymptomatic patients had milder disease than symptomatic patients, but in a univariate analysis the presence of symptoms was not prognostically significant. On multivariate analysis, the following independent prognostic factors were found: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, histological stage, and age. These features were combined to produce a prognostic model that should be valuable in the stratification of patients in clinical trials and in the timing of liver transplantation, particularly in those patients seen soon after presentation. 
Psychological aspects of orthognathic surgery: how people respond to facial change. This study was undertaken to explore the motivations and problems shared by adult orthognathic surgical patients over the age of 25. Objective findings included demographic information and reasons for seeking surgery. The majority of 65 respondents cited functional problems as their primary reason for seeking treatment. Eighty-nine percent were pleased with esthetic changes, and 83% responded that the functional problem had been corrected. For most, the greatest discomfort related to the surgery was the postoperative intensive care unit. Two of the most common side effects of the surgery were the loss of sensation in the lips and chin area and a short period of depression. Women had depression more often than men but were more enthusiastic about the final results of the procedure. Two major areas of interest to surgeons emerged from the research. First, although women have functional problems, the majority seem to have a desire for cosmetic improvement. Having a functional problem seemed to provide the psychological permission necessary to spend the time and money for a cosmetic change. The second point focused on the need for good communication between surgeon and patient. The patients who were more positive toward the procedure and more satisfied with the results were those who were better informed and who thought they had a good system of communication with the orthodontist, surgeon, and their respective staffs. 
Secondary ischaemia in rabbit skin flaps: the roles played by thromboxane and free radicals. 1. Biochemical mechanisms of ischaemia were investigated in rabbit skin flaps subjected to 2 h of primary ischaemia then, 24 h later, to 4 h of secondary ischaemia. During secondary ischaemia, flaps underwent either total ischaemia (arterial and venous blood supply occluded) or partial ischaemia (vein only occluded). Some of these flaps were treated at the time of reperfusion with the free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and/or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38,485. 2. After 30 min of reperfusion, superoxide dismutase treatment significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels, elevated during ischaemia. Superoxide dismutase also reduced tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and xanthine oxidase, indicators of free-radical damage, and restored the depleted tissue levels of superoxide dismutase. 3. UK-38,485 treatment failed to significantly alter any of these tissue free-radical parameters, although this agent significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels. 4. Combined superoxide dismutase plus UK-38,485 treatment was not significantly better than either treatment alone with respect to any parameter. 5. Partial ischaemia led to consistently higher levels of tissue free radicals and blood thromboxane than did total ischaemia. Thus partial ischaemia appears to result in greater free-radical damage than total ischaemia. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane acts as a mediator for free-radical damage in the ischaemic changes within the flap. 
Experimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. 
Low-grade, latent prostate cancer volume: predictor of clinical cancer incidence? We hypothesize that each cell in low-grade (Gleason grade 1-3) prostate cancer tissue is at risk of transformation into a cell which produces a high-grade (Gleason grade 4-5) clinical cancer after a short period of growth. As a consequence, the volume of low-grade, latent cancer tissue in the prostate glands of men at any age determines their incidence rate for high-grade, clinical cancer a few years later. Autopsy and incidence data for both white men and black men support this conclusion, with a tumor growth period of about 7 years. The transformation rate is similar for black men and for white men, about 0.024 high-grade cancers per year per cm3 of low-grade, latent cancer volume. Our hypothesis explains the infrequent occurrence of clinical cancer despite the high prevalence of latent cancer, the steep rise of clinical cancer incidence with age despite the slow rise of latent cancer prevalence with age, and the disparities in clinical cancer incidence among some populations despite their similar latent cancer prevalence. This hypothesis suggests that low-grade cancer volume is a critical determinant of clinical cancer risk. 
The antifibrillatory actions of UK-68,798, a class III antiarrhythmic agent. The electrophysiologic and antifibrillatory properties of UK-68,798 were studied in vivo in a conscious canine model of sudden coronary death. Electrophysiologic testing was performed on conscious male mongrel dogs (14.5-21.5 kg) 3 to 5 days after surgical induction of an anterior myocardial infarction by occlusion (2 h)-reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared to saline-treated control animals, UK-68,798 at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg i.v. did not (P = .083) suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation. Six of 12 UK-68,798-treated dogs remained inducible, whereas 10 of 12 vehicle-treated dogs responded to electrical induction of arrhythmia. When compared to predrug inducibility, UK-68,798 significantly (P = .007) reduced the incidence of programmed electrical stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. In five of the six dogs inducible after UK-68,798 administration, the cycle length of the induced ventricular tachycardia was prolonged (P = .007) compared to the predrug cycle length. Heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration were not affected by UK-68,798 administration. The rate-corrected QT interval was prolonged (P less than .05) by UK-68,798. The ventricular effective refractory period was increased by UK-68,798 (158 +/- 7 msec, predrug vs. 185 +/- 7 msec, postdrug). Subsequent to programmed electrical stimulation, a 150 microA anodal current was applied to the luminal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery to induce transient episodes of posterolateral ischemia in response to electrolytic injury of the vessel wall. 
Use of leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score in differentiating malignant from benign paraproteinaemias. The leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score of peripheral blood neutrophils was examined in 20 patients with multiple myeloma and compared with the score in 18 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The mean (95% confidence limit) LAP score in those with multiple myeloma was 186 (169-218) compared with 92 (64-120) in the MGUS group. In the multiple myeloma group all but one patient had a high LAP score, irrespective of disease. No cause for raised LAP, such as infection, was present in any of the patients with multiple myeloma. In the MGUS group six patients had a raised LAP score; in two of them another cause for such a rise was present (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and primary thrombocythaemia). In neither group did the LAP score correlate with duration of the disease, bone marrow plasma cell count, paraprotein concentration, haemoglobin, total white cell or neutrophil count. It is concluded that a normal LAP count in patients with paraproteinaemia suggests a benign condition, but a raised count does not indicate a malignant condition. 
ATP-dependent K+ channels modulate vasoconstrictor responses to severe hypoxia in isolated ferret lungs. In normo- and hypoglycemic ferret lungs, the pulmonary vascular response to severe hypoxia (PiO2 less than or equal to 10 mmHg) is characterized by an initial intense vasoconstriction followed by marked vasodilation, whereas in hyperglycemic lungs, vasodilation is minimal, causing vasoconstriction to be sustained. In contrast, the response to moderate hypoxia is characterized by a slowly developing sustained vasoconstriction which is unaffected by glucose concentration. To determine the role of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels in these responses, we examined the effects of cromakalim, which opens KATP channels, and glibenclamide, which closes them. During steady-state vasoconstriction induced in isolated ferret lungs by moderate hypoxia, cromakalim caused dose-dependent vasodilation (EC50 = 7 x 10(-7) M) which was reversed by glibenclamide (IC50 = 8 x 10(-7) M), indicating that KATP channels were present and capable of modulating vascular tone. During severe hypoxia in hypoglycemic lungs [( glucose] less than 1 mM), glibenclamide markedly inhibited the secondary vasodilation. Raising perfusate glucose concentration to 14 +/- 0.4 mM had the same effect. As a result, initial vasoconstrictor responses were well sustained. However, neither glibenclamide nor hyperglycemia affected vasoconstrictor responses to moderate hypoxia or KCl, indicating that effects during severe hypoxia were not due to nonspecific potentiation of vasoconstriction. These findings suggest that in the ferret lung (a) severe hypoxia decreased ATP concentration and thereby opened KATP channels, resulting in increased K+ efflux, hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and reversal of the initial vasoconstrictor response; and (b) hyperglycemia prevented this sequence of events. 
Colonoscopic surveillance after polypectomy: considerations of cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the current recommendation that persons who have had an adenomatous colon polyp removed have periodic colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the medical literature in a simulation model to estimate the costs of and the risk for perforation associated with periodic colonoscopic surveillance for a 50-year-old man followed for 30 years. MAIN RESULTS: A program of colonoscopy every 3 years would incur cumulatively a 1.4% risk for colon perforation, a 0.11% risk for perforation-related death, and direct physician costs of $2071 for colonoscopy (discounted at 5%). If a 50-year-old man's cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer is 2.5% after the removal of a single small adenoma and if effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance every 3 years is 100%, then one death from cancer could be prevented by doing 283 colonoscopies, incurring 0.6 perforations, 0.04 perforation-related deaths, and direct physician costs of $82,000. If surveillance were 50% effective and the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer were 1.25%--a plausible scenario--1131 colonoscopies would be required to prevent one death from cancer, incurring 2.3 perforations, 0.17 perforation-related deaths, and physician costs of $331,000. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance is very sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as persons with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly. 
Screening blood donors for gastrointestinal illness: a strategy to eliminate carriers of Yersinia enterocolitica. Recent reports of fatal transfusion-associated Yersinia enterocolitica sepsis prompted a study of the feasibility of adding a question to the routine donor health history as a method of reducing this risk. In three American Red Cross blood centers, 11,323 donors were asked one of two questions about gastrointestinal symptoms during their health history screenings. Affirmative responses were obtained from 0.6 or 4.0 percent of the donors, depending on how the question was asked. In one center, more than 6 percent of donors gave affirmative answers. The efficacy of asking a relatively simple question about gastrointestinal symptoms as a way of preventing Y. enterocolitica should be evaluated further, because relatively large numbers of donors may respond affirmatively. Other methods of reducing the risk of transfusion-associated Y. enterocolitica infection should be pursued. 
Single-center comparison of results of 1000 prenatal diagnoses with chorionic villus sampling and 1000 diagnoses with amniocentesis. Large multicenter studies have confirmed the safety and accuracy of chorionic villus sampling as a prenatal genetic diagnostic procedure, but there have been few single-center evaluations. We report our experience with 1000 consecutive chorionic villus sampling procedures compared with 1000 consecutive amniocentesis procedures during the same period. The procedures were performed by the same genetic counselors, sonographers, obstetricians, and laboratory personnel. Indications for referral, demographic characteristics of patients, numbers of attempts per patient, fetal loss rates, laboratory results, and evaluation of accuracy are included. Analysis of all data suggests that chorionic villus sampling is a safe and accurate alternative to amniocentesis in our community-based teaching hospital. 
Immunocytochemical panel for the identification of malignant cells in serous effusions. The cytologic diagnosis of malignancy in serous effusions can be challenging. An immunocytochemical (ICC) panel using commercially available antibodies (to carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], B72.3, Leu-M1, cytokeratin [CK], leukocyte common antigen [LCA], S-100 protein, and vimentin) was applied to cell blocks fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution that were from 55 consecutive pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial fluid specimens. The results were correlated with data from clinical records and routine cytologic studies. Final cytologic diagnoses included 26 of adenocarcinoma and 1 of mesothelioma. The remaining 28 cases were considered to be benign (reactive) proliferations. EMA, CEA, B72.3, and Leu-M1 were present in 96%, 77%, 58%, and 42% of adenocarcinomas, respectively. These determinants were absent in the mesothelioma and the reactive effusions, although anti-CEA yielded strong background staining of inflammatory cells. The CK markers identified malignant cells in 93% of cases, but consistently stained mesothelial cells as well. Antivimentin strongly labeled mesothelial cells in all cases, with weak to absent staining of malignant cells. In 3 of 26 carcinoma cases (12%), the ICC panel identified malignant cells that were not recognized initially on routine cytologic examination. In 1 of 26 cases (4%), the panel was falsely negative. Use of this approach can improve the diagnostic accuracy of cytologic examination of serous fluids. The ICC panel is especially helpful when atypical mesothelial proliferation is present, or in cases that are clinically suspect for malignancy, but cytologically negative because there are only a few malignant cells, or those that are cytologically bland. 
Failure to awaken after general anaesthesia secondary to paradoxical venous embolus. A patient is presented who failed to regain consciousness after an apparently uneventful nine-hour revision of a total hip replacement. There were no clinically important haemodynamic changes during the operation, and oxygen saturation, capnography and acid base balance were normal throughout. Postop CT of the head showed a large left MCA infarct with midline shift. At autopsy, the patient was found to have a previously unsuspected patent foramen ovale, and a venous embolus in the left internal carotid artery, which probably had originated from the periprostatic venous plexus with a large infarct in the distribution of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The authors conclude that massive paradoxical venous emboli can occur during surgery with minimal haemodynamic changes. 
Gastric ulcer healing: a comparison of enprostil versus ranitidine. Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. We compared the effects of enprostil and ranitidine on the healing of gastric ulcers and the subsequent relapse rates over 6 months. Patients (N = 156) were recruited for a double-blind study from 12 centers in Europe; 71 were randomly assigned to oral treatment with 35 micrograms enprostil twice daily and 85 to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily for up to 8 weeks. Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar. Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%. Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%. Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively. Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers. 
Coordinate occupancy of AP-1 sites in the vitamin D-responsive and CCAAT box elements by Fos-Jun in the osteocalcin gene: model for phenotype suppression of transcription. Osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein and marker of the mature osteoblast, is expressed only in nonproliferating osteoblasts in a mineralizing extracellular matrix, while type I collagen is expressed in proliferating cells. The nuclear proteins encoded by the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes are expressed during the proliferation period of osteoblast phenotype development. We present evidence that AP-1 (HeLa cell-activating protein 1) sites residing within two promoter elements of the osteocalcin gene bind the Fos-Jun protein complex: the osteocalcin box (OC box; nucleotides -99 to -76), which contains a CCAAT motif as a central element and influences tissue-specific basal levels of osteocalcin gene transcription, and the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE; nucleotides -462 to -440), which mediates enhancement of osteocalcin gene transcription. Gel electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis demonstrated high AP-1 binding activity in proliferating osteoblasts and dramatic changes in this activity after the down-regulation of proliferation and the initiation of extracellular-matrix mineralization in primary cultures of normal diploid osteoblasts. Methylation interference analysis established at single nucleotide resolution that purified recombinant Fos and Jun proteins bind in a sequence-specific manner to the AP-1 sites within the VDRE and OC box. Similarly, an AP-1 motif within a putative VDRE of the alkaline phosphatase gene, which is also expressed after the completion of proliferation, binds the Fos-Jun complex. These results support a model in which coordinate occupancy of the AP-1 sites in the VDRE and OC box in proliferating osteoblasts may suppress both basal level and vitamin D-enhanced osteocalcin gene transcription as well as transcription of other genes associated with osteoblast differentiation--a phenomenon we describe as phenotype suppression. This model is further supported by binding of the Fos-Jun complex at an AP-1 site in the type alpha I collagen promoter that is contiguous with, but not overlapping, the VDRE. Such a sequence organization in the collagen VDRE motif is compatible with vitamin D modulation of collagen but not with osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expression in proliferating osteoblasts. 
Pentoxifylline in the treatment of vascular impotence--case reports. Vascular impotence is a common medical problem for which available therapies are limited. Three impotent patients observed in the authors' practice who were receiving pentoxifylline for treatment of claudication of the lower extremities spontaneously reported improved sexual function. A controlled trial of pentoxifylline for vascular impotence may be warranted. 
Polycystic ovary syndrome: abnormalities and management with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. Ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone achieves high ovulatory and pregnancy rates in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism while limiting the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy. However, this form of therapy is apparently less effective in polycystic ovary syndrome. The administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for 4 to 8 weeks before the initiation of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction can temporarily correct endocrine abnormalities of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as excessive luteinizing hormone and androgen secretion, and improve ovulatory and pregnancy rates in these patients. For optimal results, this pretreatment should probably be repeated before each pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction cycle. Obesity is associated with a lower success rate, and spontaneous abortion remains a prominent complication in polycystic ovary syndrome even after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog suppression. With this regimen the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy are virtually abolished. Thus, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone appears to be highly effective and safe for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome also, provided that this treatment is preceded by pituitary-ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. 
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated diseases: a pathologist's perspective. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are a useful diagnostic serologic marker for the most common forms of necrotizing vasculitis, provide a means of categorizing vasculitides so that diagnostically useful shared pathologic and clinical characteristics can be recognized, and offer insight into the pathogenesis of previously idiopathic diseases. ANCA-associated vasculitides can be categorized into a number of distinctive clinicopathologic categories, eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary renal syndrome, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. At least the latter four syndromes can also be caused by other ANCA-negative immunopathogenic mechanisms, eg, immune complex deposition. Therefore, thorough diagnostic classification requires both an assessment of clinicopathologic category, as well as an assessment of immunopathologic category. Although different ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes have distinctive clinical and pathologic features, all ANCA-associated vasculitides share a number of common pathologic features, ie, focal distribution, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration. ANCA assays have very good sensitivity and specificity for ANCA-associated diseases, but the prevalence of these diseases in the patient population being analyzed must be taken into consideration when determining the predictive value of a test result. As with all serologic tests, ANCA results must be integrated with other clinical and pathologic data in order to reach the most accurate diagnostic conclusion. 
Chronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. 
An immunohistochemical study of sarcomatoid liver carcinomas. Six cases of primary hepatic carcinomas with a significant amount of sarcomatoid elements were examined by using immunohistochemical stainings. Four of the six cases were associated with ordinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one with cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), and one with mixed HCC and CCC. Alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-1-antitrypsin were negative in sarcomatoid cells of all cases; vimentin stained positively in sarcomatoid tumor cells in two of the six cases; and cytokeratin (CK8) was detected in five cases. The CK8 was not detected in tumor cells of two cases of hepatic angiosarcoma, two of metastatic leiomyosarcomas, and one of metastatic fibrosarcoma, although vimentin stained positively in all these true sarcomas. It was concluded that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of liver carcinomas might derive from both HCC and CCC. In addition CK8 might be an excellent marker to make a differential diagnosis of sarcomatoid cancers from true metastatic or primary sarcomas of the liver. 
Outcome after emergency surgery for cancer of the large intestine. The data for 77 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction (57 patients) or perforation (20 patients) within 24 h of admission were evaluated. The patients were older and had more advanced disease than patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation. 
Pain threshold levels and coping strategies among patients who have chest pain and normal coronary arteries. Patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) tend to show lower pain threshold levels for esophageal balloon distention than do patients with other painful gastrointestinal disorders and healthy controls. The NCCP patients also report greater usage of negative pain-coping strategies, less ability to perform specific behaviors to decrease pain, and higher levels of clinical pain than do other patient and healthy control groups. Behavioral treatments produce significant decreases in pain and disruption of daily activities. Further effort is needed, however, to develop treatments for NCCP that are based on knowledge of the behavioral manifestations of this disorder and the afferent mechanisms involved in perception of visceral pain. 
Acute venous thrombosis. Therapeutic choices for superficial and deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis is common in varicose veins or veins that have undergone trauma from catheters or intravenous medications. Pain and tenderness, warmth, and erythema are diagnostic features. A compression bandage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent are often all that is required for treatment. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins beneath the deep fascia of the leg or in the pelvis or abdomen. It is often asymptomatic but must be treated to prevent pulmonary embolization and postthrombotic syndrome. Standard therapy is administration of heparin sodium for 5 days, followed by tapering and discontinuation. Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) is sometimes given simultaneously. Longer courses of anti-coagulation therapy are necessary in patients with an ongoing risk of recurrence. 
Cost effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous immune globulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [see comment] BACKGROUND. A recent randomized controlled trial of intravenous immune globulin in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of bacterial infections among patients who received intravenous immune globulin. We used decision-analysis techniques to determine whether prophylactic intravenous immune globulin is likely to result in an overall clinical benefit to patients who receive this treatment and to examine its cost effectiveness. METHODS. We constructed a model to compare two strategies: treatment with intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 400 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks and no immune globulin therapy. Baseline estimates of the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin were derived from the published results of the randomized trial. The costs of treatment, complications, and infections were estimated on the basis of component costs. Health outcomes were measured in terms of gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS. Intravenous immune globulin therapy can result in a loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy when the inconvenience of treatment is taken into account. If the inconvenience of treatment is not considered, therapy results in a gain of 0.8 quality-adjusted days per patient per year of therapy at a cost of $6 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS. Decision-analysis modeling may be applied to the results of randomized controlled trials to assess the potential clinical and financial effects of adopting the intervention in medical practice. In the case of intravenous immune globulin therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, this type of analysis suggests that treatment might not result in improved quality or length of life and that it is extraordinarily expensive in comparison with other treatments generally accepted as cost effective. 
Abnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. 
A study of nonbacterial agents of acute lower respiratory tract infection in Thai children. From January 1986 to December 1987, 596 children less than 5 years of age with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI)--manifested as laryngitis, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia--were studied for evidence of infection with respiratory tract viruses Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Of the 596 children in the study, 315 were ambulatory and 281 were hospitalized. Virologic studies included isolation and rapid diagnosis of virus from specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and serologic studies of blood samples. Cultures of NPA for C. trachomatis were performed for children less than 6 months of age who had pneumonia. Of the LRI cases, 45% were associated with viral infections of the respiratory tract and 12.1% were associated with C. trachomatis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 45.2% of infections with viral agents and was associated with acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Parainfluenza type 3 virus was the most common virus found in conjunction with laryngitis and croup. The incidence of infections due to RSV peaked in July and August, while that of infections due to parainfluenza viruses peaked in February and March; influenza viruses and adenoviruses were isolated throughout the year. 
Febrile seizure. Caring for patients--and their parents. Management of febrile seizure involves diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause and assessment of risk factors for recurrence. What should physicians tell anxious parents about this frightening occurrence? Is prophylaxis with anticonvulsant agents appropriate? The authors address these questions and discuss the changing approach to management of febrile seizure. 
Prospective blinded trial of the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps. We prospectively studied the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps in a blinded trial featuring tandem colonoscopy. Sixty-three lesions greater than or equal to 1 cm in size were discovered and none were missed. Confidence intervals of 95% are a miss-rate of 0 to 4.6%. We conclude that less than 5% of large colorectal polyps are missed during the index colonoscopic examination in a well-prepared colon. 
Symptomatic cerebral swelling complicating diabetic ketoacidosis documented by intraventricular pressure monitoring: survival without neurologic sequela. A six-year-old boy developed symptomatic cerebral swelling four hours after the initiation of treatment for newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus complicated by ketoacidosis. Ventriculostomy documented intracranial pressure over a two-day period. Increased intracranial pressure unresponsive to controlled hyperventilation and sedation was treated by administering a diuretic and by drainage via a ventriculostomy. Intracranial pressure monitoring was a useful adjunct in management of this rare, but often lethal, complication of diabetes mellitus. One year later, both school performance and the results of a neurologic examination were normal. 
Predicting left heart failure after a myocardial infarction: a preliminary study of the value of echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling and wall motion. Heart failure occurs from both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. To determine whether simple Doppler echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling could improve upon the ability of systolic function to predict heart failure after infarction, patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied within the first 36 hours by Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography. Forty-eight patients who did not have heart failure before the Doppler echocardiographic study and who did not have myocardial revascularization, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, or other complications during recovery were monitored for 6 months or to the onset of heart failure (n = 10). The univariate predictors of heart failure were age (p less than 0.05), anterior infarction (p less than 0.05), early diastolic peak filling velocity (p = 0.05), filling velocity with atrial systole (p less than 0.05), the ratio of these velocities (p less than 0.001), the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001), and the wall motion score index (p less than 0.001). However, the only independent predictors of heart failure by use of multivariant stepwise logistic regression analysis were the wall motion score index (p less than 0.05) and either the ratio of early and late peak filling velocities (p less than 0.001) or the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001). The combined use of a measure of systolic function and measures of the relative contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling were useful predictors in identifying patients likely to develop subsequent heart failure after myocardial infarction. 
Clinical patterns of paediatric urolithiasis. A series of 270 paediatric stone patients was studied retrospectively according to the clinical pattern of urolithiasis (age and sex, stone location, stone analysis, recurrence rate) and aetiology of stone disease (infection, anatomical, metabolic or idiopathic). Infection stones occurred earliest and more commonly in males and were usually upper tract struvite calculi related to Proteus infection. Anatomical stones were most commonly associated with pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and had a high recurrence rate, despite surgical correction of obstruction. Idiopathic stones most resembled those found in adult urolithiasis by virtue of occurring latest, being sited in the ureter more often and being more frequently composed of calcium oxalate. Metabolic stones were most frequently calcium phosphate or cystine and virtually all were renal. They comprised the smallest group but had the highest recurrence rate. 
Desflurane is a trigger of malignant hyperthermia in susceptible swine. Desflurane (difluoromethyl 1-fluoro 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether: CF2-H-O-CFH-CF3) is a potent inhalation anesthetic agent being investigated for possible clinical use. The authors examined the effects of this agent on normal swine and those from a special breeding program that were considered purebred for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Animals were exposed to 1 or 2 MAC or both doses of desflurane and observed for changes in end-tidal CO2, arterial blood gases, lactate, catecholamines, core temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. All normal swine tolerated exposure to desflurane without clinical signs of MH, but significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure were noted. In contrast, of six MH susceptible swine tested, two had unequivocal MH reactions to deflurane, defined by significant increases of end-tidal CO2 (greater than 50 mmHg), an increase in PaCO2 (greater than 70 mmHg), a decrease in blood pH (less than 7.30), an increase in blood lactate concentration, and an increase in core temperature. Two other susceptible swine showed equivocal signs of MH but not until desflurane had been administered for 40-60 min. Finally, two other susceptible swine showed no signs of MH after 60 min of exposure to 2 MAC desflurane. These latter four animals all developed episodes of MH immediately after intravenous succinylcholine (2 mg/kg). The increased PaCO2, blood lactate concentrations, and temperature, and the decrease in pH induced by desflurane, were successfully treated with dantrolene and supportive measures. All surviving animals were biopsied 1 to 2 weeks after the exposure to desflurane for in vitro contracture testing to confirm MH susceptibility. 
Improved specificity of myocardial thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block by dipyridamole. Reduced septal uptake of thallium-201 during exercise is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteries. This may reflect normal coronary autoregulation in response to lower septal oxygen demand; thus, dipyridamole, which uniformly exploits flow reserve, would be more accurate for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixteen patients with LBBB underwent exercise and dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within 3 months. Sensitivity for detection of left anterior descending CAD (greater than 50% stenosis) was 0.83 for exercise and 1.00 for dipyridamole. Specificity was 0.30 (visual) or 0.20 (quantitative analysis) for exercise and 0.80 (visual) or 0.90 (quantitative) for dipyridamole (p less than 0.05). Dipyridamole combined with quantitative analysis also improved specificity of CAD detection overall (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that pharmacologic vasodilation is more accurate than exercise when diagnosing CAD by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with LBBB. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in the patient with chronic pain. Chronic benign pain is commonly associated with chronic fatigue and depression. Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are also associated with each other and often include pain. Psychologic factors are prominent in these conditions, and they may share neurobiologic factors as well. Management requires separately addressing each component of patients' distress and usually includes physical rehabilitation, education, administration of nonhabituating medications and often counseling. Depression may be a favorable prognostic sign, as it suggests a treatable condition and provides incentive for recovery. 
Prognostic factors in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. In a retrospective study of 119 patients, followed for 1 to 30 years after treatment of a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, the authors searched for possible prognostic factors of the risk of recurrence. Microcarcinomas, anaplastic tumors and Hurthle cell carcinomas were excluded from the study. In a univariate analysis, age (greater than 45 years), sex (male), loss of histologic differentiation, size (greater than 3 cm), presence of carcinomatous lymphangitis, extrathyroid extension, and presence of metastasis at diagnosis were associated with a higher recurrence rate; type of growth and multifocality were not significant. In a multivariate analysis (logistic regression), age, size, and carcinomatous lymphangitis were significant predictors for women, whereas metastasis at diagnosis and cystic growth were significant for men. 
Local thrombin synthesis and fibrin formation in an in vitro thrombosis model result in platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization on collagen in heparinized blood The role of the local synthesis of thrombin in platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization in heparinized blood was examined in vitro. Mural thrombosis was visualized and measured in a thin, rectangular, collagen-coated capillary under controlled rheological conditions by using fluorescence digital videomicroscopy and fluorescence microphotometry. Thrombin activity was inhibited in heparinized blood by the synthetic competitive inhibitor, D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethylketone (FPRCH2Cl), resulting in a marked reduction in the rate of platelet accumulation on collagen surfaces, indicating a role for thrombin in platelet recruitment. Similar although lesser effects were observed by reducing thrombin synthesis with antibodies to factors II and X. To decouple the role of thrombin in platelet recruitment by direct stimulation of platelet activity from its role in thrombus stabilization via fibrin formation, thrombosis was measured in heparinized blood treated with the tetrapeptide glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline, which inhibits fibrin monomer assembly into fibrin. The ultimate level but not the initial rate of platelet accumulation was reduced markedly, indicating a role for fibrin in thrombus stabilization against hemodynamic forces. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated fibrin stands in the heparinized control samples but not in the heparinized samples with glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline. These results demonstrate a role for the local action of thrombin synthesized on the surfaces of thrombi even under conditions when the thrombin exerts no bulk effect, such as under heparin anticoagulation. Furthermore, this role appears to be a result of both platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization. 
Correlation between molecular and clinical events in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia to blast crisis. A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease. A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases. 
Detection of silent myocardial ischemia in diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia and its relation to autonomic dysfunction and pain threshold was studied in 58 men with diabetes mellitus and without cardiac symptoms. All patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing after assessment of their autonomic function and pain threshold. Silent myocardial ischemia, defined as greater than or equal to 1 mm of ST-segment depression on either exercise testing or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was corroborated by exercise-induced reversible defect(s) on tomographic thallium scintigraphy. Autonomic function was assessed by heart rate response to: (1) Valsalva maneuver, (2) deep breathing, and (3) upright posture, as well as by diastolic blood pressure response to sustained handgrip and systolic blood pressure response to upright posture. Autonomic dysfunction was defined as greater than or equal to 2 abnormal responses. Pain threshold measurements were performed using electrical cutaneous stimulation of both forearms. Of the 58 diabetic patients, 21 were found to have autonomic dysfunction (36%). Silent myocardial ischemia was detected in 10 patients (17%), and was significantly more frequent in patients with than without autonomic dysfunction (38 vs 5%, p = 0.003). There was no difference in the electrical pain threshold or tolerance in subjects with and without silent myocardial ischemia. It is concluded that silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic diabetic men occurs frequently and in association with autonomic dysfunction, suggesting that diabetic neuropathy may be implicated in the mechanism of silent myocardial ischemia. 
Use of prophylactic otic drops after tympanostomy tube insertion. In a 1-year prospective study, 60 patients with chronic serous otitis media underwent bilateral tympanocentesis with tube insertion. The right ear was treated with dexapolyspectran (a solution consisting of polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin sulfate, sulfonamide, and hydrocortisone) intraoperatively and for 72 hours afterward, and the left ear served as the control. All patients were followed up at weekly intervals for the first month. Five (8.3%) out of 60 experimental ears had purulent otorrhea within the first 14 days after surgery, compared with eight (13.3%) out of 60 control ears. Statistical analysis showed no difference between the two groups. 
Pancreatic islet cell carcinoma with hypercalcemia: complete remission 5 years after surgical excision and chemotherapy. A 45-yr-old man who presented with hypercalcemia was found to have an abdominal mass that was a pancreatic islet cell carcinoma. Although clinical features were suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, his parathyroid hormone level was not elevated. The patient underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic neoplasm which was situated in the tail of the gland. After surgery, the serum calcium fell within the normal range, suggesting that the tumor was responsible for production of a parathyroid hormone-like substance. Because of malignant histologic features of the lesion, a chemotherapeutic regimen including 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin was indicated. Five years later, the tumor has remained in total remission. 
Rapid detection of the A----G(8344) mutation of mtDNA in Italian families with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF). We devised a rapid PCR-based method to screen for an A----G transition at nucleotide 8344 of the human mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene, which was recently reported, by Shoffner and co-workers, to be associated with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF), a maternally transmitted mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Shoffner et al. 1990). We confirmed this association in five of seven Italian MERRF pedigrees. The mutation was specific for the MERRF trait, because it was never found in mtDNA of non-MERRF individuals, including 14 normal and 110 diseased controls. Our study corroborates the idea that the A----G(8344) mutation is the most frequent and widespread genetic cause of MERRF. 
"Ex vivo" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The "ex vivo" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). 
Pentoxifylline restores intestinal microvascular blood flow during resuscitated hemorrhagic shock. We studied the intestinal microvascular blood flow responses to hemorrhage and resuscitation with pentoxifylline by in vivo video microscopy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were hemorrhaged to 50% of baseline mean arterial pressure for 45 minutes and then blindly randomized to receive pentoxifylline (25 mg/kg bolus + 0.2 mg/kg/minute) or an equivalent volume of saline plus return of shed blood and an additional bled volume of Ringer's lactate solution. Hemorrhage caused intestinal microvascular blood flow to decrease to 10% to 15% of baseline values. In the control group, resuscitation restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to baseline values, but intestinal microvascular blood flow remained at 30% of baseline values. In contrast, addition of pentoxifylline to the resuscitation regimen resulted in an immediate hyperemic response with an increase in intestinal microvascular blood flow to significantly greater than baseline values followed by return to baseline. Arteriolar dilation was not responsible for the improvement in flow implicating improved flow dynamics between erythrocytes, granulocytes, and vascular endothelia within the microcirculation. We conclude that addition of pentoxifylline to resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock restores intestinal microvascular blood flow. 
The acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be explained by blockade of vascular serotonin, type 2, receptors or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effect of acute and chronic administration of ketanserin was investigated in eight hypertensive patients. Intrabrachial artery infusions of serotonin and the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine were given before and 1 hour after a single oral dose of 20 mg ketanserin and after 4 weeks of treatment with 20 to 40 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was reduced by ketanserin both after the initial dose (p less than 0.01) and after 4 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.01). During placebo, serotonin, 1 ng/kg/min, increased forearm blood flow by 51% +/- 9% (p less than 0.01), whereas the highest dose induced a decrease in flow (-33% +/- 6%; p less than 0.01). Methoxamine elicited a vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001). These effects of serotonin and methoxamine were not influenced by either the initial dose of ketanserin or after 4 weeks of treatment. It is concluded that serotonin cannot be considered a general endogenous pressor agent in these patients. The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be attributed to either vascular alpha 1-receptor or serotonin, type 2, receptor blockade. 
Liver transplantation after paracetamol overdose. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the role of liver transplantation after paracetamol overdose. DESIGN--Prospective study of consecutive candidates for transplantation and performance of transplantation over 18 months. SETTING--Liver unit, King's College Hospital, London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fulfilment of indicators of poor prognosis, selection for transplantation, transplantation, survival. RESULTS--30 of 37 patients considered to have a reasonable prognosis with intensive medical care survived. Of 14 of 29 patients considered to have a very poor prognosis and registered for urgent liver transplantation, six received liver transplants, four of whom survived, while seven died and one survived without a transplant. Three of 15 patients with poor prognostic indicators but not selected for transplantation survived. CONCLUSION--Liver transplantation will have a definite but limited role in the management of fulminant hepatic failure induced by paracetamol. 
The perils of Pauline: visual loss in a tippler [clinical conference] A 31-year-old alcoholic woman who smoked had subacute visual loss. She was treated for tobacco-alcohol amblyopia with subsequent improvement in vision. 
Lack of impact of early antibiotic therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis on recurrence rates. To determine whether recurrence rates for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis are related to the time of initiation of antibiotic therapy, we randomly assigned 113 patients with GABHS pharyngitis either to a group that began a 10-day course of penicillin V at the time of diagnosis or to a group that began the same antibiotic regimen after a dealy of 48 hours. Follow-up throat culture specimens were obtained 4 days, 2 months, and 4 months after the completion of antibiotic therapy, as well as during any interim episodes of acute pharyngitis. Serotyping of all GABHS isolates was performed to distinguish between recurrences with homologous serotypes and new acquisitions with heterologous serotypes. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in age, gender, duration of illness before enrollment in the study, initial clinical presentation, or compliance. Of the 50 patients in the immediate-treatment group, 6 (12%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. Of the 63 patients in the delayed-treatment group, 9 (14%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. These data indicate that a 48-hour delay in the initiation of penicillin therapy for GABHS pharyngitis does not reduce the recurrence rate. 
Endocrine and reproductive dysfunction following fractionated total body irradiation in adults. The endocrine and reproductive sequelae of total body irradiation for haematological malignancy have been studied in 21 patients (11 male) who were treated with 10 Gy in five fractions or 12 or 13.2 Gy in six fractions over 3 days. Eighteen patients (eight male) aged 16-49 years underwent dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with insulin hypoglycaemia, thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone stimulation and basal measurement of prolactin, sex steroids and thyroid hormones. Growth hormone responses (mean peak 64 +/- 36 mU/l, range 21-146 mU/l) and cortisol responses (mean peak 831 +/- 122 nmol/l, range 626-1105 nmol/l) were all within the normal range. Two patients had minimally elevated serum prolactin levels (445 and 588 mU/l, normal less than 350 mU/l). Serum thyroxine levels (57-133 nmol/l) were normal but six patients had elevated basal thyrotrophin (TSH) levels (6-9 mU/l) and seven had an exaggerated TSH response to thyrotrophin releasing hormone, indicating radiation-induced damage to the thyroid. Amenorrhea developed within 3 months of irradiation in all females and oestradiol levels were low, at 37-108 pmol/l (mean 58 +/- 22 pmol/l). Severe oligospermia or azoospermia was noted in men tested 5-70 months after irradiation and testicular volume was below the normal adult range in five of seven men assessed. Serum testosterone levels (12.4-35 nmol/l) were normal. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-stimulated gonadotrophin levels were elevated in all patients. However, two men have fathered two children each; one has refused semen analysis, but the other has a sperm count of 7 x 10(6)/ml (60 per cent motile, 20 per cent abnormal forms) 70 months after irradiation. When given by the above fractionated regimens, the endocrine sequelae of total body irradiation are limited to gonadal failure requiring oestrogen replacement in women and severe impairment of fertility in men. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been seen in 39 per cent of patients there is no evidence of direct damage to the hypothalamic pituitary axis. 
Steroid-responsive tubular aggregate myopathy. We report a man with an acute myalgia/cramp syndrome and tubular aggregates on his muscle biopsy. He was placed on prednisone and was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with changes of only 5 mg precipitating recurrence of symptoms. He was eventually tapered off all steroids, without symptoms, and repeat biopsy showed no tubular aggregates. We recommend similar patients be given a trial of high-dose steroids. 
Does racial variation in risk factors explain black-white differences in the incidence of hypertensive end-stage renal disease? Prospectively collected data on the incidence of treated hypertensive end-stage renal disease (HT-ESRD) were analyzed to investigate whether the higher rate of HT-ESRD in blacks compared with whites is due to differences in putative ESRD risk factors. The overall age-adjusted relative risks of HT-ESRD for black compared with white residents in the Maryland Regional ESRD Registry (Network 31) Catchment Area were 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 9.4) and 9.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 13.1) for men and women, respectively. In a population level analysis, race-specific HT-ESRD incidence rates in the black and white populations of 13 regions in Network 31 were related to the prevalence of putative ESRD risk factors in those populations. The latter were estimated from the 1981-1982 Maryland Statewide Household Hypertension Survey. Black populations had a 5.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 8.1) higher unadjusted incidence of HT-ESRD than white populations. The HT-ESRD incidence in a population was also directly related to that population's prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, and diabetes mellitus and inversely related to measures of socioeconomic status and mean age at diagnosis of hypertension. When adjusted simultaneously for age, prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, diabetes, and level of education, the risk of HT-ESRD was still 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 6.2) times higher for black compared with white populations. Our findings failed to support the hypothesis that race-related differences in the prevalence, severity, or age at onset of hypertension, in the prevalence of diabetes or in socioeconomic status, explain the well-recognized black-white differences in the HT-ESRD incidence. 
The prevalence of oral lesions in HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men: three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts. To establish the prevalence of HIV-related oral lesions, we performed oral examinations of members of three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts of homosexual and bisexual men over a 3-year period. Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous and erythematous candidiasis, angular cheilitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and oral ulcers were more common in HIV-infected subjects than in HIV-negative subjects. Among HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia was the most common lesion [20.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.5-23.3%] and pseudomembranous candidiasis was the next most common (5.8%, 95% CI 4.1-7.5%). Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous candidiasis, angular cheilitis and Kaposi's sarcoma were significantly more common in patients with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of erythematous candidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma increased during the 3-year period. Careful oral examinations may identify infected patients and provide suggestive information concerning their immune status. 
The effect of streptokinase on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with intravenous streptokinase is known to restore blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, little is known about its effect on chest pain. In a retrospective cohort study, 76 patients treated with streptokinase were compared to 76 patients not treated with streptokinase. All patients had acute myocardial infarction and less than 6 h of cardiac symptoms. Patients treated with streptokinase had a significantly lower need for nicomorphine (median 20 mg) than patients not treated with streptokinase (median 41 mg). Correspondingly, the median duration (3.5 h) of pain was reduced significantly in patients treated with streptokinase compared to patients not treated (24 h). We conclude that intravenous streptokinase given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is effective in reducing the duration of cardiac chest pain. 
Cure of early-stage Hodgkin's disease with subtotal nodal irradiation. Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure. 
Prolonged hemorrhagic shock does not impair regeneration of plasma coagulant masses in the rabbit. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Twelve adult male albino rabbits were assigned alternately to normotensive and hypotensive groups to assess the effect of hypovolemic shock on spontaneous correction of dilutional coagulopathy. All animals underwent dilutional exchange transfusion with 200 mL of rabbit RBCs and 5% human albumin. Half the animals were then acutely hemorrhaged and subsequent aliquots of blood removed as needed to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 40 mm Hg. RESULTS: By 6 hr after production of dilutional coagulopathy, masses and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II had increased modestly but significantly, and Factor VII mass and concentration and in vitro coagulation had returned almost to normal; plasma volume was unchanged in the normotensive animals. In the hypovolemic shock animals, where coagulant mass regeneration was as rapid as in the normotensive animals, a doubling of total plasma volume (p less than .01) prevented the concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II, and hence the coagulation times, from improving. CONCLUSIONS: Dilutional coagulopathy corrects spontaneously within hours. Normovolemic shock prolongs dilutional coagulopathy not by impairment of factor regeneration but because of further (internal) dilution due to plasma expansion. Rapid correction of dilutional coagulopathy is likely to necessitate cryoprecipitate administration. 
Genetics of colon cancer. Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years. Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed. 
Rare intrathoracic complications in acute pancreatitis. Ascites and pleural effusions may complicate pancreatitis but pericarditis with pericardial effusion and tamponade is rare and necrosis of mediastinal fat has not been described before. All these complications occurred in the case reported here. 
Receptors for tumor necrosis factor on neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia are expressed in vitro but not in vivo. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that induces proliferation of neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating TNF responsiveness, we have examined TNF receptor expression on neoplastic B-CLL cells. We have demonstrated that freshly isolated neoplastic B cells from patients with CLL did not express TNF receptors. After 1 day of incubation in culture medium, TNF receptors were detectable in the range of 540 to 1,500/cell. Kinetic experiments revealed that receptor expression was half-maximal after 3 hours of culturing and required de novo protein synthesis. The Scatchard plots of TNF-alpha binding indicated a single set of high-affinity TNF receptors with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/L. TNF receptor expression in vitro was found in all examined cases. All cytokines tested, with the exception of IL-2, did not influence the expression of TNF receptors. The TNF receptor expression is enhanced in B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 when compared with the receptor expression of cells cultured in medium alone. Our data suggest that neoplastic B-CLL cells in patients with stable disease do not express TNF receptors in vivo and that an unknown mechanism suppressing TNF receptor expression in vivo may play a role in growth regulation of neoplastic B cells. 
Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of aorta. Immediate and long-term results BACKGROUND. As angioplasty techniques have been refined and larger low-profile balloons developed, a nonsurgical approach to recoarctation has become available. Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure. However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients. This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old. Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients. Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery. Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05). There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%). Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg. Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months). Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up. Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation. 
Syringomyelia secondary to congenital intraspinal lipoma. Preoperative evaluation using serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an infant with lumbosacral lipoma. Syrinx formation arising just above the lipoma was observed in conjunction with rapid growth of the lipoma. Definite shrinkage of syringomyelia was obtained after radical excision of the lipoma. The syrinx formation was possibly caused by compression from the extramedullary lipoma. 
Loss of the endothelin signal pathway in C6 rat glioma cells persistently infected with measles virus. Endothelin 1 causes a strong Ca2+ signal in C6 rat glioma cells as measured by fura-2 fluorescence. This endothelin 1-induced Ca2+ signal was not observed when the cells were persistently infected with a measles virus strain of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE, strain Lec). Binding of 125I-labeled endothelin 1 to the C6/SSPE cells was less than 5% of the binding to the C6 control cells, suggesting that the impairment in signal transduction was due to a loss of binding sites for endothelin 1. Treatment of the C6/SSPE cells with measles antiserum resulted in the loss of expression of viral proteins located in the membrane as well as inside the cells (antigenic modulation), but it restored neither the endothelin 1-induced Ca2+ rise nor the 125I-endothelin 1 binding. Cocultivation of uninfected C6 cells with C6/SSPE cells (9:1 ratio) resulting in contact-mediated transmission of measles virus showed that the 125I-endothelin 1 binding activity was gradually lost as a consequence of persistent virus infection. 
Cerebrovascular accidents complicating pregnancy and the puerperium. The decreasing incidence of direct causes of maternal death over the past half century has led to a heightened awareness of nonobstetric factors responsible for maternal mortality. For example, cerebrovascular accidents are an important nonobstetric cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. During the 6.5-year period from 1984 to mid-1990, we encountered 15 women in whom pregnancy or the puerperium was complicated by an acute cerebrovascular accident. Six of these women had hemorrhagic strokes and nine had ischemic strokes. During this same time, approximately 90,000 women were delivered at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and thus the incidence of stroke was about one in 6000 pregnancies. Chronic hypertension or preeclampsia was causative in three cases of hemorrhagic stroke. It is important that 20% of the women died as a result of stroke, and of the 12 survivors, 40% have residual neurologic deficits. An aggressive work-up to define the etiology of stroke is necessary in order to implement cause-specific management, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality. 
Clinical results of mitral valve replacement with and without preservation of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and subvalvular apparatus. In this study we attempted to investigate the importance of posterior leaflet preservation during mitral valve replacement (MVR). One hundred and forty randomly selected patients with isolated mitral insufficiency were studied, half of whom had MVR with preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group I), whereas in the other half conventional MVR was performed, without preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group II). Within these two groups there were no in hospital deaths, but 5 patients in Group II were admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure and 3 of them died after approximately 6 months. Long term mortality rate was 4.2% in Group II. Ejection fraction (EF) decreased postoperatively from 56% to 50% in Group I (p less than 0.05), and from 59% to 49% in Group II (p less than 0.05). Fifteen patients in each group and aged below 30 with sinus rhythm and in the first functional capacity according to the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) were subjected to exercise study, 18 months after the operation. After exercise EF increased from 47% to 64% in Group I and decreased from 51% to 47% in Group II. These findings suggested that MVR with the preservation of the chordae tendineae can be done with a low morbidity and mortality rate in the early and late postoperative period. 
Platelet-activating factor produces shock, in vivo complement activation, and tissue injury in mice. We previously showed that TNF and endotoxin (LPS) synergize to activate the complement system and produce shock and bowel injury in normal mice. However, C5-deficient mice were protected from these adverse effects. In this study, we show that in mice, platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist prevents TNF- and LPS-induced complement activation, bowel injury, and death, indicating that PAF mediates the actions of TNF and LPS. We then examined the role of the complement system in PAF-induced shock and tissue injury. We found that 1) PAF (3 micrograms/kg) induces shock, hemoconcentration, bowel necrosis, and death in normal mice, whereas C5-deficient mice are protected from these effects. (Protection was abrogated when the dose of PAF was raised to 5 micrograms/kg.) Furthermore, when C5-deficient mice were reconstituted with normal serum, they also developed shock, bowel injury, and death in response to PAF. Thus, C5 is required for PAF to induce injury. 2) PAF activates the complement system in vivo, but not in vitro. The mechanism of complement activation by PAF is unclear. Inasmuch as PAF stimulates neutrophils to release protease that may activate the complement system, we examined the effect of neutrophil depletion on PAF-induced injury and complement activation. We found that neutrophil depletion fails to prevent PAF-induced complement activation, although PAF-induced lethality is much reduced. We conclude that PAF causes complement activation, and acts in synergy with active complement fragments to produce shock and tissue injury. Neutrophils probably do not play the pivotal role in PAF-induced complement activation. 
Evaluation of the Graseby PCAS. A clinical and laboratory study. The Graseby patient-controlled analgesia system was evaluated in the laboratory and in clinical use. The problems encountered with eight examples used to treat 510 patients are reported. Laboratory performance revealed the unit to be accurate at infusion volumes of 1 and 2 ml. 
Occupational and industrial toxin exposures and the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal Toxicology Subcommittee of the American College of Gastroenterology Patient Care Committee. The subcommittee on Gastrointestinal Toxicology of the Patient Care Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology has reviewed potential effects of exposures to occupational and industrial hazards on the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. This review is presented to 1) share clinical data concerning gastrointestinal toxicology, 2) emphasize the paucity of available information to the practicing clinician, and 3) stimulate basic research interest in this field. 
Necrotizing fasciitis. Ten cases of necrotizing fasciitis are reviewed. Three patients died but only two of these deaths were due to uncontrolled septicaemia. All isolated organisms were sensitive to a combination of piperacillin and ampicillin which we now regard as the initial antibiotic combination of choice. Prompt and aggressive surgical debridement remains the cornerstone of management. 
Breast specimen microcalcifications: radiographic validation and pathologic-radiologic correlation. A prospective analysis of specimens from location and biopsy of mammographically suspect microcalcifications in 108 patients was carried out to determine if microcalcifications were lost during histopathologic processing and the clinical relevance of such loss. Nine hundred sixty-eight paraffin blocks were prepared from 425 gross tissue slices containing calcifications identified at radiography of the specimens. Calcium was apparently lost both during preparation of the blocks (13.6%) and after slide preparation (12.6%), for a total possible loss of 26.2%. All specimens demonstrated calcification histologically. One pathology report was amended because of information obtained after recuts, but all cancers were detected on original slides whether or not calcifications were identified initially. The results indicate that, by following the suggestions offered to ensure adequate histopathologic sampling of calcification seen at mammography, most if not all of the calcification present can be detected on the original slide. 
A cluster of related zinc finger protein genes is deleted in the mouse embryonic lethal mutation tw18. We report that a number of related zinc finger protein genes are closely linked on mouse chromosome 17. At least four of these genes are transcribed in the 8.5-day postcoitum embryo and are deleted in the t complex early acting embryonic lethal mutation tw18. We have evidence that additional finger protein genes are located in this region. These findings demonstrate that related finger protein genes can be clustered in the murine genome and identify genes that may be considered as candidates for the tw18 mutation. 
Remote cortical dysfunction in aphasic stroke patients. We studied the effect of deep-seated left hemispheric lesions on cortical blood flow in 18 right-handed aphasic stroke patients. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured at rest and during the performance of a functional naming test using the two-dimensional xenon-133 inhalation method. Compared with 10 controls, at rest the patients showed regional cortical hypoperfusion in the left frontoparietal region. In the controls, activation patterns from the rest to the test condition involved mainly the left hemisphere areas. In the patients, a lack of blood flow change was observed in several areas that were usually hypoperfused at rest. However, in patients with slight verbal expression disorders there were obvious blood flow increases in other brain regions in both hemispheres. Such cortical functional reorganization and the presence of a remote cortical dysfunction could play a role in the pathophysiology of language disorders. 
In vitro perfused-superfused cat carotid body for physiological and pharmacological studies. An in vitro perfused carotid body preparation was developed to study its chemosensory responses to physiological and pharmacological stimuli. The carotid bifurcation with the carotid body was vascularly isolated and excised from pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats. The CB was perfused in a chamber by gravity (80 Torr) with modified Tyrode's solution (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid-NaOH at pH 7.40) equilibrated at a given Po2 and superfused with the same medium at (Po2 of 20 Torr). The temperature was maintained at 35.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The frequency of chemosensory discharges (CD) was recorded from the whole carotid sinus nerve (n = 24), and the responses were tested by repeated interruptions of perfusate flow (SF), perfusion with hypoxic medium, and injections of nicotine and cyanide (0.1 nmol to 1 mumol) and hypercapnic medium. During hyperoxic perfusion, SF resulted in a sigmoidal increase in CD, reaching a maximum that was 23.6 +/- 4.4-fold greater than the basal activity. Restoration of flow returned CD promptly to basal values. After normoxic perfusion, SF led to a similar maximal activity more rapidly, but the duration was shorter. Reduction of the perfusate PO2 (Po2 from 450 Torr to 150, 30, and less than 10 Torr) caused a nonlinear increase in CD. CO2 stimuli (PCo2 38-110 Torr) resulted in a linear increase in CD. Nicotine or cyanide increased CD in a dose-dependent manner. The preparation retained its initial responsiveness for 2-3 h, making extensive experimental studies feasible. 
Evaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. 
Germ cell tumors masquerading as central nervous system sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis is uncertain without typical multisystem involvement. We describe two patients with isolated central nervous system mass lesions whose biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. After a progressive clinical course, they were found to have diencephalic germinomas. Germ cell tumors, in particular, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis as they are potentially treatable, occur in intracranial locations favored by sarcoidosis mass lesions, and may be surrounded by granulomatous inflammation that can be mistaken for the noncaseating granulomas of sarcoidosis. 
Circulating ICAM-1 isoforms: diagnostic prospects for inflammatory and immune disorders. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is an important early marker of immune activation and response. Evidence on its role has come from immunohistological staining of tissues, since no free circulating ICAM-1 has been detected. By means of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and a sensitive chemiluminescence technique, free circulating ICAM-1 was detected in serum from sixteen healthy young volunteers. The concentrations varied among the subjects. Non-denaturing gel separation methods showed that ICAM-1 circulates in at least three isoforms, the proportions of which also varied. These findings have important implications for the investigation, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of various inflammatory, neoplastic, and immune disorders. 
Biology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from malignant disease in Western society. Apart from the fortunate few patients who present with a resectable small pancreatic adenocarcinoma, conventional treatment offers no hope of cure and has little palliative value. Over the past two decades major steps have been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic growth and neoplasia. This review sets out to explore these advances, firstly in the regulation of normal pancreatic growth, and secondly the mechanism which may be involved in malignant change of the exocrine pancreas. From an understanding of this new biology, new treatment strategies may be possible for patients with pancreatic cancer. 
Microanalysis of bile acid composition in intrahepatic calculi and its etiological significance. Brown pigment stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts were compared with those found in the extrahepatic bile ducts with special reference to the bile acids modified by bacterial intervention, that is, unconjugated, glucuronidated, secondary, and ketonic bile acid fractions. The former showed significantly lower amounts of total bile acids (P less than 0.01) and lower proportions of unconjugated bile acid fraction (P less than 0.01), secondary bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05), and ketonic bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05) to total bile acids than the latter. The discriminant analysis using these bile acid parameters led to complete separation between intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones in the case of brown pigment stones. In contrast, cholesterol stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts showed the bile acid composition close to those found in the extrahepatic ducts and gallbladder. The above data show that the bacterial infection plays a less important role in the formation and ensuing growth of most intrahepatic brown pigment stones than in extrahepatic stones, and that factors other than or in addition to bacterial infection are involved. 
A prospective study of respiratory failure after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital. We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation. 
Nonpharmacologic treatment of periodic leg movements in sleep. The effects of a 30-minute stimulation of the dorsiflexors of the feet and toes before bedtime were investigated in eight patients with periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS). None were taking medications at the time of the investigation. All subjects were treated with the EMS-250 Neuromuscular Stimulator, which has a maximum output per channel of 1.5mA and a frequency of 47Hz. Stimuli were delivered via a pulse train (on for 1.5sec and off for 1.8sec). A single all-night polysomnogram after this stimulation showed that all patients responded to stimulation, with reduction of leg movements from an average pretreatment PLMS index of 44.6 per hour to a posttreatment PLMS index of 14 per hour (p less than .01). Nocturnal leg movements were primarily reduced during the non-REM sleep. Multiple indices of sleep continuity did not change significantly, although there was a trend toward better sleep consolidation. 
Absent or reversed end diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical artery and necrotising enterocolitis. Absent or reversed end diastolic flow (AREDF) velocities in the umbilical artery were identified in 25 high risk pregnancies. In six pregnancies the fetus was abnormal and all but one of these ended in perinatal death. Of the 19 morphologically normal fetuses, three died in utero and there were four neonatal or infant deaths. The mortality rate was 48% for all pregnancies and 37% for those with morphologically normal fetuses. There was a highly significant increased risk for the development of necrotising enterocolitis in these morphologically normal fetuses with AREDF (53%) compared with controls (6%) who did have umbilical artery end diastolic flow velocities in fetal life. There were no significant differences between the matched pairs for parameters of neonatal outcome chosen to reflect neonatal morbidity. These findings demonstrate the close association between AREDF and necrotising enterocolitis that appears to be independent of other variables such as degree of growth retardation, prematurity, and perinatal asphyxia. 
The contributions of interpersonal conflict to chronic pain in the presence or absence of organic pathology. This study investigated the influences of social support and interpersonal conflict on chronic pain in patients with arthritis or with myofascial disorders. Measures of social support, conflict, and pain were drawn from subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory. Patients with myofascial disorders reported significantly worse pain (sensory and affective), higher depression scores, more interpersonal conflict, and less support from others than patients with arthritis, but did not differ from them on personality traits. Also, the contributions of conflict to pain were found to depend on the nature of the chronic disorder and on the source of the conflict, i.e., significant other, family, or social network members. For patients with arthritis, less intense pain (sensory and affective) was associated with higher family conflict. Less intense sensory pain in arthritis was also associated with more punishing responses from the significant other to pain. For patients with myofascial disorders, more intense affective pain was associated with higher social network conflict. Social support did not significantly contribute to pain for either group. Thus, chronic painful disorders may differ on the influences that social relationships have on pain. The implications of these differences for treatment are discussed. 
Total avulsion of an osseointegrated screw. The close union achieved between pure grade titanium and healthy bone makes dislocation a rare event. We report the case of the total avulsion of an apparently well-integrated implant from a healthy mastoid bone. 
Uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 in a phenotypically abnormal familial balanced 13/14 Robertsonian translocation carrier. A 9-year-old mentally retarded girl with multiple congenital anomalies was found to carry a balanced 13/14 Robertsonian translocation [45,XX,t(13q14q)] which was also present in her father. Her mother carried a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14 [46,XX,t(1;14) (q32;q32)]. Both of her parents were phenotypically normal. Molecular studies were carried out to determine the parental origin of chromosomes 1, 13, and 14 in the patient. Using probes for D14S13 and D14S22, we could show that the patient inherited both chromosomes 14 from her father and none from her mother. Similar studies using probes for chromosomes 1 (D1S76) and 13 (D13S37) loci showed the presence of both maternal and paternal alleles in the patient. Our findings indicate that paternal uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 most likely accounts for the phenotypic abnormalities observed in our patient. It is suggested that uniparental disomy may be the basis for abnormal development in at least some phenotypically abnormal familial balanced-translocation carriers. 
Sleep difficulties, pain and other correlates. A multiple regression analysis was used with variables relevant to sleeping problems from a large community health survey in South Australia. The variables that were found to be most strongly correlated with sleep problems were, in order of importance, pain, anxiety, age, somatic health and annual household income, all of which accounted for 22% of the variance. Weight problems, depression and sex of the respondent were not so important in this analysis. Arthritis, which often increases with age, appeared to be most strongly associated with pain, explaining in part why sleeping problems increase with age. Anxiety, pain and poor somatic health were most strongly associated with lying awake at night or sleeping badly, and anxiety and pain were most strongly correlated with taking longer to get to sleep. Poor somatic health and anxiety were most strongly associated with waking early, and age and pain were the most important variables in taking tablets to aid sleep. 
Long-term patient-controlled analgesia in children. Three children who received patient-controlled analgesia for periods of up to 41 days are described. In each case patient-controlled analgesia allowed pain control to be achieved in difficult situations. No patient developed tolerance or clinical signs of dependence. This use of long-term patient-controlled analgesia warrants further evaluation. 
Transmission of infectious diseases in outpatient health care settings. Increased provision of health care in outpatient settings and concerns about occupational transmission of infections have focused attention on the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in ambulatory health care settings. In contrast to inpatient nosocomial infections, infections transmitted in outpatient settings are neither systematically monitored nor likely to be detected by routine qi surveillance. To better define the spectrum of such events, we reviewed the literature to identify cases and clusters of infections associated with outpatient health care. In this review, we identified and epidemiologically characterized 53 such reports that occurred from 1961 through 1990. Transmission occurred in general medical offices, clinics, and emergency departments (23); ophthalmologists' offices and clinics (11); dental offices (13); and alternative-care settings (six). Our findings suggest that inpatient infection-control practices should be extended to outpatient health care settings by assigning specific responsibility for infection control and by adapting surveillance methods and prevention measures. 
Staphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. Comparison to Escherichia coli. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism. 
Portal vein thrombosis complicating endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Convincing further evidence. Portal vein thrombosis occurred in a patient who bled from gastric varices that developed after obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. This complication was recognized only at surgery when thrombectomy and endovenectomy preceded the successful placement of an end-to-side portocaval shunt. At histopathology, the presence of an amorphous, eosinophilic material staining negatively for fibrin and similar to sclerosant injected at sclerotherapy was observed within the clot. This latter finding, previously unreported, provides convincing evidence for the causal relationship of portal vein thrombosis to endoscopic sclerotherapy. 
Prevention of perioperative deep vein thrombosis in general surgery: a multicentre double blind study comparing two doses of Logiparin and standard heparin. H.B.P.M. Research Group. A total of 1290 patients were enrolled in a randomized multicentre double blind study in order to investigate the use of two doses of a new low molecular weight heparin, Logiparin, in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in general surgery. Patients who were included had no contraindication to heparin therapy and had at least one of the recognized risk factors for DVT. Patients were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin (UH) 5000 units b.d., Logiparin 2500 units daily or Logiparin 3500 units daily. Each treatment was given subcutaneously 2 h before surgery and continued for 7-10 days. Daily 125I-labelled fibrinogen uptake tests (FUTs) were performed from day 2 to day 7 to detect DVT, and phleboangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis. The wound was examined on a daily basis to check for haematoma formation, and all patients were followed up for 1 month after operation. All three treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, weight, diagnosis and type of operation performed. The three major inclusion criteria in the trial were malignancy, age over 60 years and a history of varicose veins. Positive FUTs (UH = 4.2 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 7.9 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 3.7 per cent) and positive angiograms (UH = 3.0 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 5.6 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 2.3 per cent) were significantly more common in the Logiparin 2500 units daily group than in the UH and Logiparin 3500 units daily groups. The rates of major complications (severe haemorrhage, death, pulmonary embolism, reintervention) were similar in the three groups. 
Treatment of pulmonary endometriosis with a long-acting GnRH agonist. We report the case of a patient who was successfully treated with a long-acting GnRH agonist for pulmonary endometriosis. This 28-year-old woman had symptomatic pleural endometriosis, documented by biopsies, as well as symptomatic pelvic endometriosis. Two surgical procedures, consisting of excision of pleural endometriotic tissue and partial pleurectomies, failed to relieve her chest symptoms. Little relief was achieved with pseudopregnancy treatment. Satisfactory symptomatic improvement was obtained with danazol, but this medication had to be discontinued because of severe side effects. Trial of a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, achieved complete remission of her chest symptoms; in addition, the patient became pregnant immediately after cessation of therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy may be an important therapeutic alternative for women with pulmonary endometriosis who cannot tolerate danazol treatment and in whom surgical therapy fails to relieve the chest symptoms. 
One hundred ten consecutive primary orthotopic liver transplants under FK 506 in adults. An account is given of the 6- to 12-month survival, and causes of failure in 110 consecutive patients who underwent primary liver transplantation under treatment from the outset with FK 506 and steroids. The patient survival is 92.7%, and the first graft survival is 87.3%. At a very high frequency, the patients achieved good graft function, and they had a relatively low morbidity that was partially ascribable to minimal use and early discontinuance (in 60% of cases) of steroids. Renal dysfunction and other adverse findings were largely confined to patients with poor initial graft function and consequent apparent alteration of the kinetics of FK 506 elimination, causing functional overdosage. Results compare very favorably with our past record using conventional immunosuppression, and support the belief that FK 506 is a superior immunosuppressive agent which is suitable for chronic administration. 
Hepatic perfusion index (HPI) in mesenteric angina and following successful revascularization. This is a case report of a 45 year old man who had previously undergone a small bowel resection for acute mesenteric ischaemia. He subsequently suffered from mesenteric angina due to stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and intermittent claudication due to aorto-iliac atheroma. The patient underwent a successful aorto-bifemoral Y graft and small bowel revascularization with a saphenous vein graft between the Y graft and the accessible proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery. Before vascular reconstruction, the hepatic perfusion indices (HPI) in both the fasted and fed states were elevated; after mesenteric revascularization the HPI values were substantially lowered. The hepatic perfusion index may, by demonstrating functional abnormality, be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia and also in the assessment of treatment. Further evaluation of HPI in patients with suspected mesenteric ischaemia is therefore required. 
Diagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis characterized by mucosal inflammation, rash, cervical adenopathy, indurative edema of the hands and feet, and late membranous desquamation of the fingertips. Early cardiac effects include myocarditis (occasionally with congestive heart failure), pericardial inflammation, and, rarely, valve involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described. However, since long-term epidemiologic studies have not yet been performed, it is prudent to consider childhood Kawasaki disease to be a potential risk factor for coronary disease, especially in atherosclerosis-prone Western societies. 
Characterization of in vivo expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 E4 protein in cervical biopsy tissues. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins in the pathogenesis of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer is poorly understood. To characterize E4 protein expression in 49 paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies representing different histopathologic grades of disease, antibodies were elicited to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 20-34 of a protein predicted to be encoded by the HPV 16 E4 open reading frame. The E4 protein was detected throughout the spectrum of CIN, from CIN1 to CIN3. Expression was localized to the cell nucleus, primarily in the superficial layers of the squamous cervical epithelium. Ultrastructural studies showed that the E4 protein was organized into compact, intranuclear arrays 25-35 nm in diameter. E4 protein expression was also demonstrated in some histologically normal tissues containing HPV 16 DNA, but not in any of five cervical cancers containing HPV 16 DNA. These results suggest that E4 protein expression may precede development of light microscopic tissue abnormalities, that it may continue through the spectrum of CIN, and that expression of this protein may be reduced or terminated in invasive cancer. The function of this protein remains unknown, but its nuclear localization may be consistent with a role in viral maturation. 
Discontinuation of lithium treatment in remitted bipolar patients: relationship between clinical outcome and changes in sleep-wake cycles. In this preliminary report, we describe four patients in whom long-term lithium therapy was discontinued, combined with actigraphic monitoring to assess changes in motor activity and the sleep-wake cycle. Two patients experienced rapid relapse of manic symptomatology, while two remained stable throughout a 1-year follow-up. Actigraphic monitoring revealed disintegration of the sleep-wake cycle and increased motor activity in the relapsed patients only. It is suggested that actigraphic recordings can be used to monitor lithium discontinuation. 
Conventional blood conservation techniques in 500 consecutive coronary artery bypass operations. With use of a nonpharmacological, simple, and inexpensive program for blood conservation, 500 consecutive patients underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting without need of homologous red cell transfusions in 493 (98.6%). At least one internal mammary artery was grafted in all but 1 patient, with supplemental saphenous vein grafts. Intraoperatively, autologous heparinized blood was removed before bypass and retransfused at the conclusion of extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after operation. The mean postoperative mediastinal blood loss was 643 +/- 354 mL, whereas 624 +/- 296 mL was autotransfused. Thirteen patients (2.6%) needed reexploration for bleeding, of whom 7 (7/500, 1.4%) received homologous blood. No other patients required red cell transfusions. In addition, 9 patients were given a mean of 2.6 units of fresh frozen plasma because of suspected coagulopathy. No platelets were transfused, and no cryoprecipitate therapy was undertaken. Thus, in total, 484 patients (96.8%) were not exposed to any homologous blood products during the hospital stay. At discharge, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 121 +/- 14 g/L (12.1 +/- 1.4 g/dL) and the hematocrit, 0.36 +/- 0.04. Postoperative complications were few. There was one in-hospital death (0.2%). 
Natural history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without oesophagitis. This retrospective study was undertaken to characterise the clinical course and reflux pattern of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux without evidence of oesophagitis. We investigated 33 patients (12 women, 21 men; mean age 36 years) with typical symptoms, a negative oesophagoscopy, and a 24 hour oesophageal pH-metry indicative of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux. All patients received antacids or prokinetic drugs or both for three to six months. Nineteen of 33 patients still had symptoms at the end of treatment, of whom five had developed erosive changes of the oesophageal mucosa. The other 14 discontinued treatment and remained asymptomatic during a six month follow up period. Comparison of the pretreatment pH-metry data of the 19 symptomatic patients and the 14 asymptomatic patients showed no differences in the pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the two groups. We conclude that in a substantial proportion of patients with pathological reflux without oesophagitis symptoms may persist and mucosal lesions may develop during conventional treatment without any apparent change in the reflux. Patients who developed endoscopic oesophagitis did not have a more severe pretreatment pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux when compared with those who did not develop oesophageal mucosal damage. 
Copper loading of hearts increases postischemic reperfusion injury. We studied the role of copper as a potential mediator of postischemic reperfusion injury in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Hearts were equilibrated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 10 minutes and then loaded with copper by way of perfusion with buffer containing 20 microM copper(II)-bis-histidial for 30 minutes. Control hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer alone during the loading period. Hearts than were washed with buffer for 10 minutes and subjected to 20 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed a 67% increase in total copper content in loaded hearts by the end of the wash. By the end of the 30-minute period of reperfusion, control hearts demonstrated a 50-60% recovery of myocardial function as determined by peak systolic pressure, contractility, and heart rate. In contrast, copper-loaded hearts exhibited virtually no functional recovery within the 30-minute time period. Using salicylate as a probe, we determined that peak and duration of .OH formation appears to be increased in copper-loaded hearts during reperfusion. Furthermore, efflux of lactic dehydrogenase was significantly increased in copper-loaded hearts. Our results clearly demonstrate that increasing cardiac content of copper results in enhanced postischemic reperfusion injury associated with increased formation of .OH, thus suggesting an important catalytic role for this transition metal. 
Gastric cancer in Scotland: changing epidemiology, unchanging workload. OBJECTIVE--To determine the changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland between 1978 and 1987 and in the operative workload in Lothian between 1979 and 1988. DESIGN--Analysis of national incidence statistics for gastric cancer derived from the Scottish national cancer registry, deaths from gastric cancer recorded by the registrar general for Scotland, and Lothian surgical audit data. SETTING--Scotland and Lothian Health Board area. PATIENTS--Patients in Scotland with gastric cancer during 1978 to 1987 inclusive; patients in Scotland with gastric cancer recorded on their death certificate as cause of death during 1978 to 1987; patients who had an operation in Lothian for gastric cancer during 1979 to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland from 1978 to 1987 and in the number of operations performed for gastric cancer in Lothian from 1979 to 1988. RESULTS--Mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland fell by about 25% over the 10 years. The incidence and standardised incidence of gastric cancer showed a marginal decline of about 9%. The differences in trends between incidence and mortality were significant (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--This study shows that the surgical workload associated with gastric cancer is not declining. This is because the incidence has remained almost static, which may be due to the relative increase in the numbers of older people in the population, who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer. Gastric cancer should not be regarded as a disease in decline. Incidence and workload should determine resources allocated to this disease rather than mortality statistics. 
Mucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas with mucin extrusion through an enlarged papilla. Patient records, imaging films, macroscopic and microscopic features, and clinical follow-up data of seven Japanese patients with a mucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas were reviewed. The mucin-hypersecreting tumor was defined as an enlarged major or minor papilla with a dilated orifice and visible mucin oozing on endoscopy. The series consisted of six men and one woman ranging from 47 to 79 yr old. The excretion of mucin through a patulous orifice of the enlarged ampulla of Vater was seen in six patients and of the enlarged minor papilla in the other patient with pancreas divisum. The main pancreatic duct was dilated in all patients. Amorphous mucin was seen in the dilated duct of five patients, and papillary nodules were present in two patients. Computed tomography and/or ultrasonography showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct with multilocular cysts in six patients and with a solid tumor in the other patient. The tumor was located diffusely in the main pancreatic duct in one patient, whereas it was confined to branches in the head (four patients), body (one patient), or tail (one patient) of the pancreas in the six other patients. Histopathologic diagnosis was a cyst lined by hyperplastic mucus-secreting epithelium in one patient, mucinous cystadenoma in two, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in two. Five patients underwent resection and have survived for 1-46 months after the operation. The authors would like to emphasize this endoscopic syndrome because about half of mucin-hypersecreting tumors are malignant with a favorable prognosis. 
The correlation between immunological reaction in the arterial wall and the time course of the development of cerebral vasospasm in a primate model. To investigate the role of immunological reactions in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the authors studied the correlation between immune/inflammatory reactions in the arterial wall and the time course of vasospasm in primates. Twenty monkeys were divided into four groups of 5 animals each: 1) a control group of sham-operated animals, 2) animals subjected to angiography 3 days after the induction of SAH (3-day SAH), 3) animals subjected to angiography 7 days after SAH (1-week SAH), and 4) animals subjected to angiography 7 and 14 days after SAH (2-week SAH). To induce SAH, the main cerebral arteries on the right were dissected free of the arachnoid, and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries. To evaluate vasospasm, all animals underwent a baseline angiogram before SAH; angiography was repeated at different intervals in each group, as outlined above. Histopathological changes and the deposition of the immunoglobulin IgG in the arterial wall were evaluated immunohistochemically in each group. The cerebral arteries on the side of the clot showed evidence of mild vasospasm (-24.6% reduction) on the angiogram performed on Day 3, severe vasospasm (-51.7%) on Day 7, and mild vasospasm (-12.8%) on Day 14. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was most marked in the spastic arterial wall in the 1-week SAH group. In the 2-week SAH group, severe myonecrosis and intimal disruption were observed, even in the vessels that showed only mild vasospasm, and the inflammatory reactions had almost abated. 
Decreasing survival benefit from cardiac transplantation for outpatients as the waiting list lengthens. Many patients are accepted for cardiac transplantation during a period of clinical instability associated with a high risk of death, even though most can be discharged home to await transplantation. As the waiting lists lengthen, priority is awarded solely on the basis of the waiting time of outpatients, who now usually undergo transplantation after they have already survived a major period of jeopardy. To determine the impact of the current waiting times and priority system on the previously expected benefit offered by transplantation, 1-year actuarial survival without transplantation was recalculated after each month without transplantation for 214 potential candidates with an ejection fraction of 0.17 +/- 0.05 discharged on tailored medical therapy after evaluation. These data were compared with the 1-year survival data of 88 outpatients who underwent transplantation. Actuarial survival after 1 year was 67% on tailored therapy compared with 88% after transplantation (p = 0.009). Death without transplantation was sudden in 43 of 51 patients, resulting from hemodynamic decompensation in 8. For outpatients already surviving 6 months without transplantation, actuarial survival over the next 12 months was 83% without transplantation. Thus, the expected improvement in survival after transplantation would be only 5% over the subsequent year for patients waiting 6 months, which is the waiting time for many outpatients. Such patients should be reevaluated to determine whether transplantation remains indicated during the next year. 
Occipital meningoceles in patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome. Occipital cephaloceles in the Dandy-Walker syndrome are not rare. To date, 28 cases have been reported. We report on 8 cases of associated occipital meningocele, totalling 16% of all patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome in our series. In all patients, communication existed between the posterior fossa cyst and the occipital meningocele. In 2 patients, the occipital meningocele disappeared after cerebrospinal fluid shunting and never required surgical repair. It appears that the cranial defect had ossified and resulted in self-closure. Poor intellectual development in persons with the Dandy-Walker syndrome is associated with the presence of other central nervous system and systemic abnormalities and not with occipital meningoceles alone. 
Application of intermediate biomarkers to studies of cancer prevention in the gastrointestinal tract: introduction and perspective. In this article, abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized. 
Nutritional support of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Malnutrition is extremely common in patients with malignant disease. Whereas the causes are multifactorial, the predominant factor is the imbalance between nutrient intake and host nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that cachexia is related to abnormal changes in host intermediary metabolism induced by host-tumor interactions, and endogenous peptides such as TNF may be important mediators. The role of nutritional therapy in cancer patients remains to be defined. Clearly, patients with severe malnutrition benefit from nutritional intervention. However, the benefit of nutritional therapy in less severe cases of malnutrition as an adjuvant to oncologic therapy has yet to be established. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome: objective measures and splint use. One hundred five adults with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were studied to assess the efficacy of a neutral-angle wrist splint, and to identify criteria for splint referral. Ten observations before and after treatment were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. After splint use, 67% of the subjects reported symptom relief. T-test comparison of sensory latency of values before and after treatment indicated improvement for the total group. Chi-square and t-tests failed to reveal significant differences between relief and no-relief groups for gender, affected hand, presence of concomitant conditions, duration of symptoms before treatment, age, length of time between pretreatment and posttreatment nerve conduction testing, initial nerve latency of motor and sensory fibers, or the difference between pretreatment and posttreatment sensory latencies. A significant difference was found for motor latency; the relief group improved and the no-relief group deteriorated. Data suggest that splinting is most effective if applied within three months of symptom onset. Those with damage to the wrist structures or median nerve were least responsive to splinting. 
Short-term antibiotic treatment in Whipple's disease. We report the results of short-term antibiotic treatment in 19 patients with Whipple's disease (WD). The diagnosis was based on clinical features and on a characteristic small bowel biopsy. Patients received treatment for a mean of 7.9 weeks (range 4-20). Fourteen were treated with de-methyl-chlortetracycline (600 mg/day), and 1 also received chloramphenicol (1 g/day); 1 was treated with ampicillin (2 g/day), and 4 were treated with amoxicillin (1.5 g/day). In all patients, the clinical response was rapid and excellent, body weight increased significantly, diarrhea subsided, and fecal fat values returned to normal. Intestinal biopsies obtained after treatment was completed showed significant improvement based on a decrease in the number of macrophages staining positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), normalization of villous structure, and decreased dilatation of lymphatic channels; free bacilli were absent, as shown both by light and electron microscopy. Seventeen patients have been followed for a mean of 99.4 months (range 6-300). Two died 30 and 72 months after diagnosis of Whipple's disease, 1 of laryngeal carcinoma and the other of colonic carcinoma. Fifteen patients are in excellent health. Three patients treated with tetracycline have had clinical and/or histologic relapses. In our experience, short-course antibiotic treatment with tetracycline or ampicillin and derivatives can be effective in WD, with few relapses and excellent outcome. No neurologic symptoms, either initially or during follow-up were observed. 
Prevalence of dementia in the 'oldest old' of a Dutch community. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence rate of dementia in subjects 85 years of age and over. DESIGN: A two-phase design with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the screening phase and the Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS) in the diagnostic phase. SETTING: Community survey including subjects in residential care. SUBJECTS: All (n = 1,259) inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands, aged 85 years and over on December 1, 1986. First phase participation rate was 71% (17% dropout due to death); second phase participation rate was 82%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: DSM-III diagnosis of dementia without further specification of the etiology of the dementia. RESULTS: An overall prevalence rate of 23% (95% C.I.: 19%-26%) was found. This included 12% mild dementia, 7% moderate and 4% severe dementia. The prevalence rate was higher among women (24%) than among men (18%). It increased with age from 19% (95% C.I.: 16%-22%) in the group of 85-89 years to 32% (95% C.I.: 26%-39%) in the group of 90-94 years to 41% (95% C.I.: 25%-58%) in the 95+ group. CONCLUSION: A fifth of the 85+ and a third of the 90+ population suffer from dementia with an indication that half of the 95+ population is affected. With the expected steep rise in the number of the oldest old, dementia will stay a major health problem in the near future. 
Mastoid misery: quantifying the distress in a radical cavity. Seventy-eight mastoid cavities were studied in 39 patients who required revision surgery for troublesome symptoms. A retrospective questionnaire was used to assign a symptom score to each patient in his pre and post-operative condition. The 5 leading symptoms of pain, wax, discharge, smell and giddiness were reviewed. A score of 15 points represented the worst case and zero the best. The average improvement after surgery was 4.7 points. Hearing was not considered in this study. 
Efficacy and cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with node-negative breast cancer. A decision-analysis model. BACKGROUND. In 1988 the National Cancer Institute issued a Clinical Alert that has been widely interpreted as recommending that all women with node-negative breast cancer receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Acceptance of this recommendation is controversial, since many women who would not have a recurrence would be treated. METHODS. Using a decision-analysis model, we studied the cost effectiveness of chemotherapy in cohorts of 45-year-old and 60-year-old women with node-negative breast cancer by calculating life expectancy as adjusted for quality of life. The analysis evaluated different scenarios of the benefit of therapy: improved disease-free survival for five years, with a lesser effect on overall survival (base line); a lifelong benefit from chemotherapy; and a benefit in disease-free survival with no change in overall survival by year 10. The base-line analysis assumed a 30 percent reduction in the relative risk of recurrence for five years after treatment. RESULTS. For the 45-year-old woman, the base-line analysis found an average lifetime benefit from chemotherapy of 5.1 quality-months at a cost of $15,400 per quality-year. The 60-year-old women gained 4.0 quality-months at a cost of $18,800 per quality-year. Under the more and less optimistic scenarios, the benefit of chemotherapy varied from 1.4 to 14.0 quality-months for both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Chemotherapy substantially increases the quality-adjusted life expectancy of an average woman at a cost comparable to that of other widely accepted therapies. This benefit decreases markedly if the changes in long-term survival are less than in disease-free survival. Given its uncertain duration, the benefit may be too small for many women to choose chemotherapy. Selective use of chemotherapy to maximize the benefit to individual patients may be possible with refinements in risk stratification and explicit assessment of the patients' risk preferences. 
Civilian craniocerebral gunshot wounds. Experience with 120 patients who incurred a gunshot wound to the head with dural penetration is presented. All of the patients were managed by a standard resuscitation protocol and assigned a clinical grade based on their level of consciousness both at the time of presentation and at 2 to 4 months after injury. Fifty patients (42%) underwent surgery. Twenty-eight patients (23%) had a good recovery, 19 (16%) were moderately disabled, 6 (5%) were severely disabled, and 67 (56%) died. All patients who were alert and awake with a normal or near normal neurological examination at the time of admission survived with a good outcome. All but 4 patients who were comatose at the time of admission died. Nine patients, however, who were not comatose at the time of admission died from potentially preventable causes. In 3 of these patients, a more aggressive diagnostic approach (including cerebral angiography) may have altered their ultimate outcome. An expeditious approach to the trauma victim with a comprehensive management scheme after injury may have altered the course in the remainder of these patients. 
Total androgen ablation: European experience. The EORTC GU Group. Zoladex plus flutamide significantly delays the time to progression (subjective, objective, first progression) compared with orchiectomy, but no difference in survival (death from all causes or from malignant disease) could be detected. Thus, a delay in the appearance of progression has not improved survival. In fact, the duration of survival after progression tends to be shorter on Zoladex plus flutamide. There is thus no evidence to suggest any survival benefit with Zoladex plus flutamide. The quality control of our data revealed acknowledged problems in defining responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The review of the Bone Scan Committee provided the data for Tables 5 to 7. These data must provoke some reflections and emphasize once again the heterogeneity of the studied patient population. Table 4 on pain response after 4 weeks is just one of the many items to be analyzed by the committees for response criteria and quality of life. We expect that the other trials face similar problems. More work and patience are needed to obtain a firm answer to this clinical problem. These efforts will never be wasted, however, because the combined results of these trials will increase our knowledge of the treated history of prostate cancer and will, we hope, indicate a net treatment benefit in some subsets of patients. An individually tailored treatment for each patient selected from the anonymous mass of cases of advanced prostate cancer would be the highest reward of our continued collaboration with all the study groups. 
Use of modified diets in nursing homes. Randomly chosen medical charts of 212 elderly subjects in 11 nursing homes were reviewed to determine which characteristics of the subjects were most closely associated with their diet prescriptions. The chart reviews indicated that 104 (49.0%) of the 212 subjects had some type of nutrient-modified diet prescription. Eight patients who were tube fed were not included in subsequent analyses. Sodium restriction was the most common modification (60 [29.4%] of the remaining 204 patients) and calorie-controlled diets were also common (52 [25.5%] of the patients). Of the 55 patients with hypertension, 31 (56.4%) had no sodium restriction. Only 10% of all low-sodium diets limited sodium to 2 g per day. Of the 38 patients with diabetes, 7 (18.4%) had no prescription for calorie control, and there was no indication that increased dietary fiber was encouraged for diabetic patients. Only one of the 121 subjects with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or atherosclerosis had a prescription for a cholesterol-lowering diet. Characteristics of the subjects not specifically related to diet or diagnosis, such as age, sex, duration of stay, and level of care, had no significant relationship to diet prescription. These findings suggest that the practitioners in our sample were not convinced of the efficacy of modified diets to control disease for most nursing home residents. 
Thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser treatment of bullous emphysema. A new technique of thoracoscopic laser ablation of pulmonary bullae suitable for patients with multiple bullae and diffuse emphysema was developed and assessed in 22 patients. 20 of 22 patients survived. Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01). Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously. Other complications were bleeding (1 patient) and unilateral acute lung injury (1 patient). These results suggest that selected patients with diffuse emphysema and pulmonary bullae may benefit from thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser ablation. 
Methotrexate and histologic hepatic abnormalities: a meta-analysis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of liver toxicity from the long-term administration of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of 15 studies examining the relationship between long-term, low-dose methotrexate administration and biopsy evidence of liver fibrosis. PATIENTS: A total of 636 patients from 15 studies. RESULTS: The incidence of progression of liver disease (defined as worsening of at least one grade on the histologic classification of Roenigk) among 636 patients was 27.9% (95% confidence intervals 24.3 to 31.6). The rate of progression of liver disease in the 15 studies was associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.01). Patients on average had a 6.7% (95% confidence intervals 2.1 to 11.4) chance of progressing at least one histologic grade on liver biopsy for each gram of methotrexate taken. The overall incidence of advanced pathologic changes on liver biopsy (grades IIIB or IV) among 636 patients was 5.0% (95% confidence intervals 3.5 to 7.0). The development of advanced histologic changes was not associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.08). Patients who according to their history were heavy drinkers (at least 100 g of alcohol per week) were more likely to have advanced changes on liver biopsy (17.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.0003) and to show histologic progression (73.3% versus 25.9%, p = 0.0002). Patients with psoriasis were more likely than patients with rheumatoid arthritis to have advanced changes (7.7% versus 2.7%, p = 0.003) and histologic progression (33.1% versus 24.3%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of liver toxicity in patients undergoing long-term, low-dose methotrexate therapy is substantial, and that risk increases with the total cumulative dose and with heavy consumption of alcohol. Heavy users of alcohol should not receive long-term methotrexate therapy. For most patients who are not heavy users of alcohol, liver biopsies should be done periodically to monitor for the occurrence of liver toxicity. 
A practical guide to nitrate use. Nitrate preparations are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic angina, acute and chronic congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Development of tolerance is best managed by providing a nitrate-free interval, thus avoiding continuous drug levels. This interval probably should be 10 to 12 hours with use of a transdermal patch. Nitrate treatment of the elderly may require lower doses to avoid hypotension. 
Radial nerve paralysis and tumor. This paper presents ten cases of radial nerve paralysis because of tumor and reviews 38 previously reported cases. The tumor distribution was 35 lipomas, four neurofibromas, four ganglions, three neuromas, one fibroma, and one neurilemoma. Malignant tumors are not discussed in this review. Electromyography is of value if diagnostic problems occur. Postoperative results are normally good. 
Massive ST-segment elevation without myocardial injury in a patient with fulminant hepatic failure and cerebral edema. A 49-year-old woman presented in fulminant hepatic failure. The ECG showed dramatic ST-segment elevation, suggesting diffuse myocardial injury. However, echocardiography, creatine phosphokinase enzyme determinations, and examination of the heart at autopsy (six days later) failed to demonstrate any physiologic, anatomic, or histologic evidence of abnormality. The appearance of ST-segment elevation in this setting should not prompt treatment for cardiac disease or limit the candidacy for liver transplantation of such critically ill patients. 
Mononeuropathy in sickle cell anemia: anatomical and pathophysiological basis for its rarity. Peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication of sickle cell disease. We report a young black woman with sickle cell anemia who developed a proximal median mononeuropathy in the setting of sickle cell crisis. The clinical and electrodiagnostic features are consistent with an ischemic mechanism from the sickling process. The pathophysiological basis for the rarity of this complication may be related to the rich anastomotic microvasculature of peripheral nerve and the unique large size of the capillaries of this vascular network. 
Scleral buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with severe myopia. From Jan. 1, 1980, to Dec. 31, 1989, we performed scleral buckling surgery on 48 eyes of 46 patients for rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia (greater than 5.00 diopters). Forty eyes of 38 patients were observed for at least six months, and the mean follow-up period was 46 months. Intraoperative complications occurred in four of 48 eyes (8%) and included retinal incarceration (two eyes), choroidal hemorrhage (one eye), and choroidal detachment (one eye). Three of the 40 eyes (7.5%) followed up for more than six months developed a recurrent retinal detachment and underwent a revision of the scleral buckle. At the last follow-up examination, the retinas of all 40 eyes were totally reattached. Final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 26 of 40 eyes (65%). Because of the low rate of intraoperative complications and the high rate of success, scleral buckling is recommended for most patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of mass screening for breast cancer in Japan. The official Japanese recommendation for breast cancer screening is physical examination by a physician, in contrast to US recommendations of mammography. In this analysis of breast cancer screening, the authors used Japanese data in a cost-effectiveness model to compare the following five strategies: (1) no screening (N); (2) physical examination alone (PE); (3) mammography (MG); (4) PE followed by MG if PE findings were abnormal (PE----MG); and (5) PE combined with MG for all screened women (PE + MG). None of these programs would save medical expenditures. The total discounted net costs per patient (in US dollars) were as follows: N, +54; PE, +412; MG, +517; PE----MG, +340; and PE + MG, +731. The number of years of life saved per cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic Japanese women would range from 708 (PE----MG) to 3724 (PG + MG). The additional cost of each strategy (compared with N) per additional year of life would be +49,700 for PE, +40,400 for PE----MG, +14,300 for MG, and +18,000 for PE + MG. The least costly screening option (PE----MG) does not have the lowest cost per additional year of life saved (MG does). MG would be preferable to the current Japanese recommendation of PE alone. 
C-erbB-2 oncogene protein in in situ and invasive lobular breast neoplasia. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) has uncertain malignant potential; biologic markers that will identify patients at risk for a poor clinical outcome have been sought actively. Amplification of the c-erbB-2 protooncogene has been correlated with poor prognosis in invasive mammary carcinoma, and immunohistochemical evaluation for expression of the oncogene protein has been correlated with gene amplification. The authors retrospectively evaluated 62 cases of lobular neoplasia for expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product on formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections, using two monoclonal anti-erbB-2 (p185) antibodies (c-neu Ab3 and m-erb) and one polyclonal anti-erbB-2 antibody (pAb 1) by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. All 62 cases were negative with the pAb 1 antibody; one of 62 cases was weakly positive with the c-neu Ab3 in a membranous pattern. Expression of c-erbB-2 gene product was identified on adjacent invasive ductal carcinoma in one case and in adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ in another. None of 15 cases if infiltrating lobular carcinoma was positive with either of the two anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies. Strong positivity was found on benign epithelium in one case, demonstrating epitheliosis. In summary, evidence of expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product was found in one of 57 cases of LCIS and none of 15 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. This suggests that, in contrast to reported data concerning intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma, c-erbB-2 oncogene amplification and/or overexpression does not play a significant role in the progression of lobular breast neoplasia. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen and head and neck cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations were determined in the sera of 45 patients with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and of 13 controls. In 13 patients serial CEA measurements were made during the follow-up period. In 38% of the patients the serum CEA level was slightly elevated (greater than or equal to 2.5 ng/ml). Only 13% of the patients had clearly elevated CEA levels (greater than 5 ng/ml). CEA levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced, e.g. stage IV, disease but a correlation between serum CEA concentration and prognosis was not found. Patients who smoked had significantly higher serum CEA levels than non-smoking patients. In the serial determinations slight CEA elevations could be found in only 50% of patients with tumour recurrence. Combined with the data from the literature we conclude that serum CEA determination is not useful in predicting the outcome in patients with a head and neck squamous carcinoma. 
Spinal cord herniation associated with an intradural spinal arachnoid cyst diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. Two rare cases of spinal cord herniation associated with intradural spinal arachnoid cyst are reported. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of spinal cord herniation, identified as a protrusion continuous with the spinal cord. Surgery upon the intradural spinal arachnoid cyst improved progressive neurological dysfunction. The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst. Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst. 
Intraluminal pulsed Doppler evaluation of the pulmonary artery velocity time curve in a canine model of acute pulmonary hypertension. The velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was investigated in an animal model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs were embolized with polystyrene microspheres, and the velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was studied with use of an invasive pulsed Doppler technique. Phasic intraluminal velocity was recorded with use of a miniature piezoelectric crystal activated by 20-MHz Doppler pulses and mounted on the tip of a needle probe introduced into the pulmonary artery. The recorded Doppler quadrature signals were processed by spectral analysis. Significant increases occurred in mean, systolic, and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures (p less than 0.0002), in pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.005), and in negative velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed toward the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.002). Significant decreases occurred in right ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.006) and in positive velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed away from the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.005). A significant shortening in the time to peak velocity (acceleration time) was found (p less than 0.005). Second-order regression analyses demonstrated an inverse correlation between the ratio of positive velocity time to negative velocity time and the mean pulmonary artery pressure in all animals (r = 0.71). These findings should be compared with the velocity patterns of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery obtained under pulmonary hypertensive conditions due to various causes to facilitate interpretation and understanding of clinical investigations. 
Energy state and vasomotor tone in hypoxic pig lungs. To evaluate the role of energy state in pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia, we exposed isolated pig lungs to decreases in inspired PO2 or increases in perfusate NaCN concentration. Lung energy state was assessed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or measurement of adenine nucleotides by high-pressure liquid chromatography in freeze-clamped biopsies. In ventilated lungs, inspired PO2 of 200 (normoxia), 50 (hypoxia), and 0 Torr (anoxia) did not change adenine nucleotides but resulted in steady-state pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) values of 15.5 +/- 1.4, 30.3 +/- 1.8, and 17.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively, indicating vasoconstriction during hypoxia and reversal of vasoconstriction during anoxia. In degassed lungs, similar changes in Ppa were observed; however, energy state deteriorated during anoxia. An increase in perfusate NaCN concentration from 0 to 0.1 mM progressively increased Ppa and did not alter adenine nucleotides, whereas 1 mM reversed this vasoconstriction and caused deterioration of energy state. These results suggest that 1) pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to hypoxia or cyanide occurred independently of whole lung energy state, 2) the inability of the pulmonary vasculature to sustain hypoxic vasoconstriction during anoxia might be associated with decreased energy state in some lung compartment, and 3) atelectasis was detrimental to whole lung energy state. 
Effect of early programmes of high and low intensity exercise on physical performance after transmural acute myocardial infarction. Does a programme of light exercise training after acute myocardial infarction produce the same improvement in treadmill performance as aerobic exercise training? Three hundred and eight men from a consecutive series of 479 men with transmural (Q wave) acute myocardial infarction, admitted to a single coronary care unit, were randomly allocated to eight weeks of group aerobic exercise training or group light exercise. Groups were well matched for all characteristics other than site of infarction, which did not significantly affect results. Mean (SD) physical working capacity (metabolic equivalents) determined by treadmill testing at the start of the study (in the third week after infarction) was 6.8 (2.2) v 6.7 (2.5) METs, at the end (in the eleventh week after infarction) 10.8 (2.3) v 9.9 (2.4) METs, and at 12 month review 10.8 (2.4) v 10.7 (1.9) METs for the exercise training group and the light exercise group respectively. The difference of 0.9 METs at the end of the study was the only significant difference between groups. There were no significant intergroup differences at any stage in resting and maximal heart rate, resting and maximal systolic blood pressure, or rate-pressure product. Apart from a small temporarily greater physical working capacity, the physical benefits of aerobic exercise training were equally well achieved by group light exercise. 
High nocturnal body temperature in premenstrual syndrome and late luteal phase dysphoric disorder. OBJECTIVE: Because women with late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) experience symptomatic affective states predictably, they can be studied to determine whether there are biological findings related solely to the clinically symptomatic state. The authors sought to answer the question, Does body temperature change with affective state? METHOD: The core body temperature and motor activity patterns of 10 women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), six of whom also met criteria for LLPDD, and no other psychological or medical illness were compared to those of six women with chronic, noncyclic dysphoria and six asymptomatic comparison women at four phases of the menstrual cycle. RESULTS: The nocturnal temperatures of the women with PMS/LLPDD were significantly higher than those of the comparison subjects across the entire menstrual cycle, but there were no differences in nocturnal activity levels. The women with noncyclic dysphoria had a mean nocturnal temperature in the follicular phase as high as that of the women with PMS/LLPDD. The temperatures of all women were higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the future investigators should document menstrual cycle phase in all female subjects and, when studying body temperature, should carefully monitor symptomatic state in comparison subjects. 
Particular HLA-DQ alpha beta heterodimer associated with IDDM susceptibility in both DR4-DQw4 Japanese and DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 whites. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) susceptibility is associated with the DR4-DQw4 haplotype in Japanese and the DR4-DQw8/-Drw8-DQw4 genotype (among others) in whites. We investigated whether these Japanese and white individuals encode the same or a similar DQ alpha beta heterodimer, which may be an IDDM-susceptibility molecule in both populations. First, we carried out genomic DQA1 and DQB1 typing with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results revealed that Japanese DR4-DQw4 and white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 IDDM patients carried the DQA1*0301 allele and the DQB1*0401 or DQB1*0402 allele, either in the cis (Japanese DR4-DQw4 individuals) or trans (white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 individuals) position. Because the DQB1*0401 and DQB1*0402 alleles differ only at residue 23, these DQB1 genes are very similar. We next tested cells from these individuals with a particular DQ-specific T-lymphocyte clone, HH58. The clone was only restimulated with cells from Japanese individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0401 alleles in the cis position or white individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0402 alleles in the trans position. Thus, particular cis- or trans-encoded DQ alpha beta heterodimers, which in both cases are recognized by T lymphocytes, may confer susceptibility to IDDM in both ethnic groups. 
Endoscopic treatment by snare electrocoagulation prior to Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation in 85 voluminous colorectal villous adenomas. The association of endoscopic resection with Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation was used to treat benign colorectal villous adenomas. Eight-five patients were included: 49 with surgical contraindications, 35 for whom surgical resection appeared to be too hazardous, and 1 who refused surgery. Forty-five tumors had an axial extension between 1 and 3 cm, and 40 tumors had an axial extension of at least 4 cm. Diathermic snare resection was performed to remove large tumoral fragments prior to laser photocoagulation of the residual flat lesions. Treatments were repeated every 15 days until total tumor destruction was achieved. A carcinoma was detected in biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopic treatment of five patients. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Treatment results could be analyzed in 78 patients. Successful treatment was achieved in 67 patients. Tumor destruction was complete in 77 percent of patients who had lesions of at least 4 cm diameter and in 93 percent of patients with smaller lesions. The axial extension of the tumor was the main factor affecting the results of treatment. No major complications occurred. During the average 103-week follow-up period, 21 percent of the patients with total tumor destruction had a recurrence. The risk of recurrence was correlated with the number of initial treatment sessions and previous surgery treatment. It would appear that the treatment with endoscopic resection prior to Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is a safe and effective method in the destruction of colorectal villous adenomas. 
Reference systems in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis with registration of respiration. Registration of respiration allows analysis at the end-expiratory phase and may thus favor the use of the fixed-reference system versus the floating-reference system in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis. Analysis is performed on two-dimensional echocardiograms of 44 normal subjects, 38 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, and 17 patients with posterior myocardial infarction. Two different models for wall motion analysis are applied, each using the fixed-reference system and the floating-reference system, respectively. In patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the anterior, septal, and apical walls, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. In patients with posterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the posterior wall, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. These findings indicate that the fixed-reference system is superior to the floating-reference system in quantification of wall motion of end-expiratory two-dimensional echocardiograms. 
Comparison of speed of onset of analgesic effect of diamorphine and morphine. In a random, double-blind crossover trial using an ischaemic limb pain model we have assessed the speed of onset of analgesia after an i.v. bolus of equipotent doses of diamorphine and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Pain and its subsequent relief were assessed by means of a visual analogue scale. Two of the subjects found diamorphine acted quicker than morphine, one found no difference and nine found that morphine was quicker than diamorphine. The mean time to diamorphine effect was 53% greater than for morphine (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). These findings suggest that, for rapid relief of pain, morphine is more suitable than diamorphine. 
New autonomic and sensory neuropathy with loss of adrenergic sympathetic function and sensory neuropeptides. A 30-year-old woman with longstanding dizziness was found to have a severe postural fall in blood pressure and a reduced skin axon-reflex flare response. Autonomic tests indicated selective impairment of adrenergic sympathetic function. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and dopamine beta hydroxylase were undetectable. Skin biopsy specimens showed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y (markers of adrenergic sympathetic fibres) and of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (sensory neuropeptides). A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed severe depletion of unmyelinated fibres. The constellation of losses were compatible with nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, which was confirmed on assay. This new syndrome may be explained by loss of trophic action of NGF. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years. The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression. 
Compartment syndrome of the thigh with osteogenesis imperfecta. A case report. Compartment syndrome of the thigh has been sporadically reported in the orthopedic literature. A 27-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta sustained a femoral fracture with relatively minor trauma and subsequently developed compartment syndrome of the thigh. Fat embolism syndrome and hyperplastic callus developed postoperatively. 
Regression of hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma after hepatic arterial chemoembolization. Two patients with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the liver were treated by hepatic chemoembolization with cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge followed by hepatic arterial infusion of vinblastine. Effective palliation in terms of durable tumor regression was achieved in both patients after two chemoembolization-infusion procedures. These results suggest that regional therapy may offer new hope for the subset of sarcoma patients who have liver metastases resistant to combination systemic chemotherapy. 
The Damus-Fontan procedure. The Damus-Kaye-Stansel operation is a useful technique for the treatment of complex cyanotic congenital heart disease when there is obstruction between the systemic ventricle and the aorta. Modifications of the technique include transection of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, anastomosis of the contiguous aortic and pulmonary walls, and connection of the distal aorta to the perimeter of the new bivalved proximal great artery. In addition, the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt technique can be used with or without the Fontan procedure. Six patients underwent a Damus-Fontan operation, and all survived. Two patients underwent the Damus-cavopulmonary shunt (hemi-Fontan) procedure, and 1 survived. The postoperative status of the 7 survivors is good to excellent. Follow-up ranges from 2 months to 7 1/2 years. 
Anastomotic obstruction after stapled enteroanastomosis. We have recently treated two cases of anastomotic obstruction after side-to-side stapled enteroanastomosis. Complete obstruction of a stapled small-bowel anastomosis has not been reported to our knowledge. The mechanism of the obstruction appears to be the healing together of the cut edges of viable bowel beyond the inverted stapled lines. An alternative method of constructing the functional end-to-end enteroanastomosis that is offered is intended to prevent the occurrence of postoperative anastomotic obstruction. 
Epidemiologic aspects of shigellosis and other causes of dysentery in Thailand. Nearly 20% of children seen in the outpatient department of Children's Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, for diarrheal disease had bloody diarrhea. Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli--isolated from 13% and 2% of children with diarrhea, respectively--were the most frequent causes of bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter species and nontyphoidal Salmonella species were also isolated frequently but were much less often associated with bloody diarrhea. Shigella species were rarely isolated from patients who did not have diarrhea, while Campylobacter and Salmonella species were isolated frequently from well children. None of the species isolated always caused bloody diarrhea. Studies on infection with Campylobacter suggest that natural immunity may prevent bloody diarrhea and in fact may eventually prevent all disease due to this organism. Studies of endemic Shigella flexneri and epidemic Shigella dysenteriae 1 in Thailand have shown that immunity may also explain an age-related decrease in rates of S. flexneri infection but not in rates of S. dysenteriae 1 isolation. 
Cerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. 
Gastrointestinal lipomas: a radiologic and pathologic review. Lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are an infrequent finding on radiologic examination; however, they occur often enough to warrant consideration in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the gut. In many instances, their morphologic characteristics allow the specific diagnosis of a lipoma. In this report, we review gastrointestinal lipomas with an emphasis on their radiologic and pathologic correlation. 
Spectrum of orthostatic disorders: classification based on an analysis of the short-term circulatory response upon standing. 1. In 31 consecutively referred patients (20 females, 11 males) with overt or suspected orthostatic disorders, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that occur in the first 2 min of standing were analysed. 2. Blood pressure was measured continuously by Finapres. The blood pressure and heart rate responses after 1-2 min of standing (early steady-state response) were used to classify the patients as follows: group I (n = 17, age 42 +/- 17 years), normal early steady-state blood pressure and heart rate responses; group II (n = 5, age 40 +/- 14 years), combination of normal early steady-state blood pressure and postural tachycardia; group III (n = 9, age 51 +/- 14 years), hypotensive orthostatic response with (4/9) or without (5/9) postural tachycardia. We examined whether additional information could be obtained by beat-to-beat analysis of the initial circulatory response (first 30 s). It was quantified by identifying the blood pressure trough and overshoot and the maximum heart rate and relative bradycardia. 3. The initial drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between the three groups. A recovery of blood pressure with a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure overshoot was present in all group I and II patients, but was absent in all except two patients in group III. The initial maximum heart rate increase did not differ between the three groups. The relative bradycardia was less in groups II and III than in group I. 4. We conclude that analysis of the beat-to-beat blood pressure changes in the first 30 s after the onset of standing provides almost all the information that is necessary to determine abnormalities in orthostatic circulatory control. 
Does atrial appendectomy aggravate secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide? The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure. 
Systemic contact dermatitis from pseudoephedrine. A patient with rhinitis developed systemic contact dermatitis when starting oral treatment with Rhinalair, containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. A few months later, another oral treatment Rinutan, containing norephedrine hydrochloride, provoked a more severe generalized eczema. Patch test reactions were strongly positive to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, slightly positive to phenylephrine and negative to epinephrine. Norephedrine was not tested. 
Colorectal surgery: short-term prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or gentamicin. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of aztreonam plus clindamycin with that of gentamicin plus clindamycin for prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery. A total of 138 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to treatment with clindamycin (600 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or gentamicin (80 mg) 30 minutes before and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. The study included 122 patients (88.4%) with colorectal carcinoma. Samples from the abdominal cavity and from the subcutaneous tissues were taken for bacteriologic study. All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections. Aztreonam/clindamycin appears to be a valid alternative to gentamicin/clindamycin for the prophylaxis of infections following colorectal surgery. 
Incidence and management of airway problems in the CHARGE Association. The airway problems associated with anaesthesia in patients with the CHARGE Association have been underreported. We undertook a retrospective review of 50 cases, of which anaesthetic records were available for 37 patients. Apart from choanal atresia and cleft lip and palate, 56% of patients has some other upper airway abnormality. There appeared to be greater difficulty in tracheal intubation with increase in age in four patients. The incidence and management of airway abnormalities are discussed. 
Report of a hidden case of overfeeding. Nutritional support is essential to the care of the critically ill patient, but complications of overfeeding can occur. Precise metabolic measurement by indirect calorimetry can detect problems of nutrition and allow adjustment in caloric intake. This case study illustrates the complications of carbon dioxide retention and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation with subsequent prevention of further complications. 
Failure of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy in experimental enterococcal endocarditis. To assess the potential efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) against serious enterococcal infections, we used a rat enterococcal endocarditis model comparing TMP-SMX therapy (500 mg of TMP plus 2,500 mg of SMX per kg of body weight per day given every 8 h by intragastric gavage) with intravenous ampicillin therapy (1,000 mg/kg per day). Despite concentrations of active drug in serum well in excess of the MIC and MBC, the mean residual vegetation bacterial titer in TMP-SMX-treated rats was similar to that in untreated controls (8.4 +/- 1.1 versus 8.6 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g) and significantly higher than that in the ampicillin-treated group (3.6 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g; P less than or equal to 0.001). This demonstrates discordance between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of TMP-SMX in serious enterococcal infection. 
Identification of a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in a patient with an intracranial ependymoma. We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53 gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon 7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited. 
Late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiograms and patency of the infarct-related artery in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. This study evaluated the relation between patency of the infarct-related artery and the presence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) in 124 consecutive patients (98 men, 26 women; mean age 59 years) with acute myocardial infarction receiving thrombolytic therapy, acute percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or standard care. All patients were studied by coronary angiography, measurement of ejection fraction and signal-averaged ECG. The infarct-related artery was closed in 51 patients and open in 73. Among patients with no prior myocardial infarction undergoing early attempted reperfusion therapy, a patent artery was associated with a decreased incidence of late potentials (20% versus 71%; no significant difference in ejection fraction). In the 48 patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the incidence of late potentials was 24% and 83% among patients with an open or closed artery, respectively (p less than 0.04). The most powerful predictors of late potentials were the presence of a closed infarct-related artery, followed by prior infarction and patient age. Among patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the only variable that was predictive of the presence of late potentials was a closed infarct-related artery. These data imply that reperfusion of an infarct-related artery has a beneficial effect on the electrophysiologic substrate for serious ventricular arrhythmias that is independent of change in left ventricular ejection fraction as an index of infarct size. These findings might explain, in part, the low late mortality rate in survivors of myocardial infarction with documented reperfusion of the infarct-related artery. 
Serum inhibin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome: effect of insulin resistance and insulin secretion. Insulin resistance is common in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. We investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and the serum inhibin concentration in a group of 19 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and eight control subjects at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Insulin resistance was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and inhibin was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Insulin sensitivity (mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced in the polycystic ovary syndrome group compared with controls: reduced insulin sensitivity 46.7 +/- 5.0 min-1/(nmol/mL), normally insulin-sensitive 106.6 +/- 11.7 min-1/(nmol/mL) (P less than .01). The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had inhibin levels (126 +/- 15.2 microLEq/mL) comparable to those found during the early follicular phase of the control group (117 +/- 22.1 microLEq/mL), but significantly lower than late follicular phase (259 +/- 25.6 microLEq/mL) or luteal phase (448 +/- 91.8 microLEq/mL) levels in the control group. No association was found between the degree of insulin resistance and the inhibin concentration, which remained unaltered over a 3-hour period despite maximal stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion. The inhibin concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome may reflect impaired follicular maturation. Inhibin secretion is not acutely affected by insulin secretion in normal or in hyperandrogenic women. 
Absence of human papilloma virus in cervical adenocarcinoma determined by in situ hybridisation. A few studies using DNA technology have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an aetiological factor for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Twenty one cases of cervical adenocarcinoma were studied by in situ hybridisation using biotinylated DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and a streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase detection system. Intranuclear HPV DNA was detected in none of the adenocarcinomas, while positive controls gave a clear intranuclear signal. Adjacent areas of normal, koilocytic, and dysplastic squamous epithelium also gave positive results. It may be that squamous epithelium contaminates adenocarcinomas reported as positive by Southern blotting. Our results showing absence of detectable HPV DNA within adenocarcinomas suggest that HPV infection may not have a major role in the aetiology of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. 
Treatment with pulsatile luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone modulates folliculogenesis in response to ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins in patients with polycystic ovaries. Combined treatment with pulsatile LH-RH and hMG, given to eight patients who had anovulation associated with PCO and resistant to CC, significantly reduced the number of large follicles induced by hMG alone. A direct effect of pulsatile LH-RH on the ovary is postulated. This combined treatment eased the problems of multifollicular development, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing complications in patients with PCO stimulated by gonadotropins. 
First clinical study of the selective 5-HT3 antagonist, granisetron (BRL 43694), in the acute treatment of migraine headache. Granisetron (BRL 43694), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was assessed as acute therapy for the first time in migraine patients. In an open pilot study 7 migraine attacks were treated in 6 patients. All but 1 patient experienced marked and rapid relief from the headache, and nausea and vomiting were rapidly resolved in the 6 cases where these symptoms accompanied the attack. No side effects were recorded. Development of granisetron for migraine was suspended during the study for extraneous reasons. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
QTc prolongation measured by standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an independent risk factor for sudden death due to cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND. QTc prolongation has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden death; however, a controversy exists over its significance. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death. 
Risk of adverse events in children completing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: St. Jude Total Therapy studies VIII, IX, and X. We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in 624 patients who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in three consecutive total therapy studies (VII, IX, and X, 1972 to 1983). Event-free survival in study X was significantly better overall than that in studies VIII and IX (P less than .0001 by the log-rank test). In study X, 75% of the patients were electively taken off therapy, compared with 54% in studies VIII and IX. However, the risks of having an adverse event during the first 5 years after completion of therapy were remarkably similar: 22% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 29%) in study X versus 24% (20% to 29%) in studies VIII and IX. Bone marrow, testicular, and CNS relapses accounted for the majority of failures in both groups (85% in study X and 92% in studies VIII and IX). Late adverse events consisted largely of hematologic relapses and the development of solid tumors. Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure. 
An educational device for Mohs micrographic surgery. A three-dimensional model of basal cell carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer (fresh-tissue technique) involves the processing of tissue in a complex fashion. The advantages of this method relate to the asymmetric three-dimensional growth of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A device is described here based on published knowledge about the growth of BCC. The model demonstrates the precise way in which Mohs surgery varies from other surgical approaches to yield higher cure rates in specific circumstances. This device may be helpful in educating residents and medical students about Mohs surgery and in preparing patients for this procedure. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Agrobacterium radiobacter peritonitis in two patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis. We report two patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis who developed peritonitis in which the infecting organism was Agrobacterium radiobacter, normally a rare pathogen in humans. Both patients initially responded to antibiotics, but later relapsed and required catheter removal. Neither had been exposed to soil or plant material. A radiobacter is yet another of a growing list of unusual organisms that infect the peritoneal cavity of peritoneal dialysis patients.
