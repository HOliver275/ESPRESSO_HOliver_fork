Myeloablative combination chemotherapy without total body irradiation for neuroblastoma. Myeloablative treatment intensification in 25 patients diagnosed when older than 12 months of age with stage IV neuroblastoma included sequential delivery of cisplatin 120 mg/m2 x 1, hyperfractionated radiation (2,100 cGy) to the primary site and adjacent lymph nodes, carmustine (BCNU) 200 mg/m2 x 1, melphalan 60 mg/m2/d x 3 (n = 13) or thiotepa 300 mg/m2/d x 3. (n = 12), and etoposide (VP 16) 300 mg/m2/d x 3. Seventy-two hours after the last dose of VP 16, histologically tumor-free and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC; 100 mumol/L)-purged autologous bone marrow (ABMT) was infused. Acute toxicities included grade 3 to 4 oral mucositis, grade 1 to 2 diarrhea, and fevers. No patient required infusion of unpurged reserve autografts. At ABMT, 16 patients (group I) were progression-free 6.5 months to 14 months (median, 9 months) from diagnosis: seven remain progression-free 20 months to 46 months (median, 39 months) off therapy, six relapsed 4 months to 17 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (candidiasis, metabolic derangement, and venoocclusive disease [VOD]). The event-free survival of group I patients is 44% at 24 months post-ABMT. Nine patients (group II) were in second remission at ABMT, including three who had relapsed after other transplant procedures: two are progression-free 24 months and 41 months off therapy, four relapsed 3 months to 12 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (aspergillosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, VOD). Only one of 10 relapses involved a primary site, suggesting a beneficial effect of local radiation. In terms of survival or toxicity, an advantage for melphalan or thiotepa was not evident. Regimens such as this may prolong the survival of selected patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma, but concerns over late relapses and toxicity mandate continuing efforts to devise alternative, less risky, and more clearly beneficial approaches for definitive ablation of neuroblastoma. 
Enalapril prevents cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmias in hypertensive rats. To evaluate the effects of hypertension on cardiac hypertrophy, on myocardial structure, and on ventricular arrhythmias, 27 3-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg) daily for 11 months and compared with 26 untreated control rats. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in treated rats, and at the end of the experiment, it was 199 +/- 3 mm Hg (treated) versus 237 +/- 3 mm Hg (controls) (p less than 0.001). At this time, spontaneous arrhythmias and induced arrhythmias either by programmed electrical stimulation (train of stimuli +1 or 2 extrastimuli) or by trains of eight stimuli at decreasing coupling intervals were observed in isolated heart preparations. Comparing enalapril-treated and control rats, spontaneous arrhythmias (9 of 27 versus 20 of 26, respectively; p less than 0.01), programmed stimulation-induced arrhythmias (3 of 26 versus 12 of 23, respectively; p less than 0.01), and trains of stimuli-induced arrhythmias (4 of 26 versus 14 of 19, respectively, p less than 0.001) were less frequent in the enalapril group. Left ventricular weight was decreased in treated rats by 18% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril administration diminished the fraction of myocardium occupied by foci of replacement fibrosis normally occurring in control rats by 59% (p less than 0.001). Finally, a significant correlation was found between left ventricular weight, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. It was concluded that chronic treatment with enalapril, which resulted in attenuation of systemic arterial pressure by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, decreases the propensity of the heart of hypertensive rats to arrhythmogenesis. 
Bilateral carcinoma of the external auditory meatus. A 65-year-old woman had suffered for two months from bilateral tinnitus and discharge, pain in the right ear, and loss of hearing. Biopsy showed carcinoma of the squamous type on both sides. Tomography revealed bone destruction on the right. The patient was treated with radiotherapy. Two months after treatment, tomography showed tumour regression on the right side, but progression on the left. The literature on this subject is reviewed. 
Can computer aided teaching packages improve clinical care in patients with acute abdominal pain? OBJECTIVE--To compare three methods of support for inexperienced staff in their diagnosis and management of patients with acute abdominal pain--namely, with (a) structured data collection forms, (b) real time computer aided decision support, and (c) computer based teaching packages. DESIGN--Prospective assessment of effects of methods of support on groups of doctors in one urban hospital and one rural hospital. SETTING--Accident and emergency department at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, and surgical wards of Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire. PATIENTS--Consecutive prospective series of all patients presenting to each hospital in specified time periods with acute abdominal pain; total patients in the various periods were 12,506. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy of participating doctors, admission rates of patients with non-specific abdominal pain, perforation rates in patients with appendicitis, negative laparotomy rates. RESULTS--Use of any one modality resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and decision making performance. Use of structured forms plus computer feedback resulted in better performance than use of forms alone. Use of structured forms plus a computer teaching package gave results at least as good as those with direct feedback by computer. CONCLUSIONS--The results confirm earlier studies in suggesting that the use of computer aided decision support improves diagnostic and decision making performance when dealing with patients suffering from acute abdominal pain. That use of the computer for teaching gave results at least as good as with its use for direct feedback may be highly relevant for those who are apprehensive about the real time use of diagnostic computers in a clinical setting. 
Differential pathophysiology of bacterial translocation after thermal injury and sepsis. Bacterial translocation (BT) occurs transiently after thermal injury and may result from an ischemic intestinal insult. To evaluate continued intestinal ischemia in the ongoing BT associated with sepsis after injury, rats were randomized to (1) 30% burn injury with Pseudomonas wound infection (BI), (2) BI + fluid resuscitation (BI + Fluid), (3) BI after allopurinol pretreatment to inhibit xanthine oxidase (BI + Allo), or (4) BI after azapropazone pretreatment to inhibit neutrophil degranulation (BI + Aza). On postburn days (PBD) 1, 4, and 7, animals were studied for evidence of BT and intestinal lipid peroxidation. BI + Fluid, BI + Allo, and BI + Aza significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced rates of BT and ileal lipid peroxidation acutely after thermal injury (PBD 1) compared to BI. All four groups had equally high rates of BT associated with the onset of sepsis (PBDs 4 and 7), without evidence of further intestinal lipid peroxidation. These data indicate that the chronic gut barrier failure associated with sepsis after injury occurs independently of continued intestinal ischemia. 
Stroke in a young adult with Fletcher trait. We have reported the case of a young woman with prekallikrein deficiency who had a cerebral infarction despite a prolonged APTT. She had bleeding complications with heparin administration. From the limited information in the literature, anticoagulation may be hazardous in these patients, and it should be undertaken with caution. 
Efficacy and safety considerations in women with uterine leiomyomas treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists: the estrogen threshold hypothesis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists induce a reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadal environment. Leiomyomas are common, estrogen-sensitive, benign neoplasms that decrease in size by 40% to 50% during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. During gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy most women are amenorrheic. After discontinuation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment, uterine and myoma size increase and a return to pretreatment menstrual patterns often occurs. Concerns about the safety of long-term hypoestrogenism have made long-term gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration an undesirable treatment strategy. This article focuses on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists as preoperative therapy in selected women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy and the combination of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist with estrogen-progestin "add-back" treatment as a potential long-term medical therapy for women with symptomatic leiomyomas. Finally, an estrogen threshold hypothesis to assess the effects of circulating estrogen concentrations on different tissues, is presented. 
Globus pharyngeus: long-term follow-up and prognostic factors. A prospective trial of 80 patients with globus pharyngeus is reported. An in-depth analysis of the typical history at presentation is given. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 21 to 42 months). The asymptomatic rate at this interval was 25%, with a further 35% reporting a significant improvement in symptoms. Three independent factors were found to influence prognosis (p less than .05). These were sex, length of history at consultation, and the presence or absence of associated throat symptoms. Male patients having a history of the globus symptom for less than 3 months and not complaining of any associated throat symptoms had the best chance of becoming asymptomatic or symptomatically improved. The presence or absence of heartburn or its treatment had no bearing on outcome. 
Cardiac tamponade and hydrothorax as complications of central venous parenteral nutrition in infants. The recent use of soft catheters made of silastic polymeric silicone or polyurethane has decreased the incidence of perforation of great veins or right-sided heart chambers but has not eliminated it as had been hoped. Two premature infants who presented with cardiac tamponade more than 24 hr after the insertion of a 23-gauge silastic catheter for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administration are described. In one infant, bilateral hydrothorax preceded the occurrence of cardiac tamponade. Osmotic injury to great vessels and/or myocardium seems to be the common mechanism but which these complications of intraluminal catheters are produced. Review of the pediatric literature revealed a proportion of low birth weight infants among the reported cases. Despite a prohibitively high mortality rate, early recognition can prevent a fatal outcome. 
Clipping of an aneurysm 20 years after encasement with methyl methacrylate. Case report. A variety of agents have been used to coat aneurysms as an alternative to clipping. These agents were employed more frequently prior to the routine use of the operating microscope and the presently available variety of aneurysm clips. One such coating agent is methyl methacrylate. This report describes a patient with an anterior communicating aneurysm that rebled 20 years after being encased in methyl methacrylate. At operation, the pulsating aneurysm had eroded the adjacent layer of methyl methacrylate, creating a small intervening space. This space allowed removal under the microscope (with a high-speed air drill and a diamond bit) of the methyl methacrylate from the anterior cerebral arteries and aneurysm, exposing it for definitive clip placement. The feasibility of clipping encased aneurysms is discussed. 
Acute venous thrombosis. Therapeutic choices for superficial and deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis is common in varicose veins or veins that have undergone trauma from catheters or intravenous medications. Pain and tenderness, warmth, and erythema are diagnostic features. A compression bandage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent are often all that is required for treatment. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins beneath the deep fascia of the leg or in the pelvis or abdomen. It is often asymptomatic but must be treated to prevent pulmonary embolization and postthrombotic syndrome. Standard therapy is administration of heparin sodium for 5 days, followed by tapering and discontinuation. Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) is sometimes given simultaneously. Longer courses of anti-coagulation therapy are necessary in patients with an ongoing risk of recurrence. 
Tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor is important in systemic and cutaneous defense, homeostasis, and many disease states. The numerous and diverse effects of tumor necrosis factor are best understood when considered as concentration-dependent, with normal homeostasis progressing to defense followed by toxic effects. Understanding tumor necrosis factor is important for the dermatologist as more studies appear in our literature and potential clinical uses of tumor necrosis factor (and possible anti-tumor necrosis factor agents) are realized. 
Elevated tissue concentrations of sialyl Lex-i in cancerous tissues compared with those in noncancerous tissues of various organs. Sialyl Lex-i (SLX) concentrations in the extracts of noncancerous and cancerous tissues of various human organs were determined by radioimmunoassay for detailed evaluation of SLX. Cancerous tissues had significantly elevated SLX concentrations compared with noncancerous tissues of various organs. Tissue SLX concentration of the cancerous part was significantly higher than that of the adjacent noncancerous part in the same tissue. There was no significant correlation between tissue SLX concentration and serum SLX level. Positive localization of SLX was clearly observed in such cancerous tissues by immunohistochemical study, although not in any noncancerous tissues. Each of the antigens: SLX, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 125 showed a different distribution pattern in tissue concentration or localization in various organs. These results indicate that SLX may be a valuable cancer-associated antigen produced by malignant tissues, suggesting its clinical application as a tumor marker. 
Multi-parameter flow cytometric quantitation of the expression of the tumor-associated antigen SM3 in normal and neoplastic ovarian tissues. A comparison with HMFG1 and HMFG2. SM3 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a peptide epitope in the core protein of polymorphic epithelial mucin. Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to characterize the expression of SM3 and compare it with two related tumor-associated antigens, HMFG1 and HMFG2, in cell suspensions of 44 malignant ovarian tumors, 15 benign ovarian tumors, and 16 normal ovaries. Tumor-associated antigen expression was significantly higher in malignant ovarian neoplasms than in benign neoplasms (P less than 0.001 for all three antigens). SM3 was expressed more specifically in malignant than benign tumors but had a lower affinity than HMFG1 and HMFG2. Multi-parameter flow cytometric evaluation of a panel of monoclonal antibodies can be used to help in choosing the best antibody for immunohistochemistry, imaging, and eventually treatment of ovarian tumors. 
Isotopic findings in anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: report of an adult case. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary trunk results in myocardial ischemia or infarction, and may be a cause of death in the first months of life. Some patients, however, develop satisfactory coronary collateral circulation and remain asymptomatic into adulthood. In these patients, myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function are not well understood. We report the case of a 17-yr-old female patient, suffering from anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary trunk, who underwent reimplantation of the left coronary artery to the aorta. The preoperative permanent 201Tl defect of the left antero-lateral ventricular wall and the abnormal regional wall motion induced by stress exercise testing were fully reversed after the operation. 
Effect of dietary alpha-linolenate on platelet-activating factor production in rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The effects of dietary alpha-linolenate (18:3, n-3) and linoleate (18:2, n-6) on platelet-activating factor (PAF) production were examined. Rats were fed an alpha-linolenic acid-rich (perilla oil) diet or a linoleic acid-rich (safflower oil) diet for 6 wk, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were elicited by peritoneal injection of casein. The overall phospholipid content and composition as well as the subclass distribution of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids in PMN were not altered by these diets. However, with the perilla oil diet their content of a putative precursor of PAF, 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was approximately 50% of that with safflower oil diet. On exposure to various concentrations of FMLP, PAF formation by PMN in the perilla oil group was less than 50% of that by PMN in the safflower oil group. A larger difference in PAF productions by PMN in the two dietary groups was observed on their stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187. These results demonstrate that PAF production is modulated in some as yet unknown way by changing the alpha-linolenate/linoleate balance of the diet. 
"Near miss" death in obstructive sleep apnea: a critical care syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to alert critical care physicians to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea with respiratory failure ("near miss" death) and to elucidate characteristics that might allow earlier recognition and treatment of such patients. DESIGN: We examined clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure. These characteristics were compared with those of eight stable apnea patients of similar severity but without a history of presentation with respiratory failure. SETTING: Medical ICU and pulmonary outpatient clinic at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea who presented in, or developed, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were matched to eight stable obstructive sleep apnea outpatients from the chest clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of these 16 patients were reviewed and multiple characteristics that might predict these obstructive sleep apnea patients prone to respiratory failure and death (called the "near miss" death group; n = 8) were examined. The mean age of the near miss group was 57 yrs. All eight patients presented with respiratory acidosis (mean pH 7.22), hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 82 torr [10.9 kPa]), and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 45 torr [6.0 kPa]). Six of the eight patients had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by clinical characteristics and spirometry. Predisposing factors included facial trauma, lower respiratory tract infections or bronchospasm, and use of pain medication. All but one of the near miss subjects had awake hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 49 torr [6.5 kPa]) and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 58 torr [7.7 kPa]) during periods of clinical stability while only two controls had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and none had hypercarbia. The prevalence of a history of wheezing and prior hospitalization for "respiratory problems" were greater in the near miss group. Once cured of apnea, no patient presented with recurrence of respiratory failure in follow-up ranging from 6 to 80 months, and cor pulmonale recurred in only one patient during subsequent onset of central apneas. CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea who have concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypercarbia and hypoxemia are more prone to develop severe respiratory failure and probable death than those patients with apnea alone. The current study shows that recurrent respiratory failure and presumably mortality from this acute complication can be reversed with effective treatment of the obstructive apnea. 
Community control of scabies: a model based on use of permethrin cream For 18 years treatment with lindane or crotamiton products has failed to stem the epidemic of scabies among the Kuna Indians in the San Blas islands of the Republic of Panama. Permethrin 5% cream was introduced as the only treatment in a programme to control scabies on an island of 756 inhabitants and involving workers recruited locally. Prevalence fell from 33% to less than 1% after every person was treated. As long as continued surveillance and treatment of newly introduced cases was maintained, prevalence of scabies remained below 1.5% for over 3 years. When supply of medication was interrupted for 3 weeks, prevalence rose to 3.6%. When control was lost after the US invasion of Panama, prevalence rose to 12% within 3 months. Bacterial skin infections decreased dramatically when scabies was controlled. Permethrin is safe and effective even in areas where this disease has become resistant to lindane. 
Localization of breakthrough site of canine monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by pacemapping. A vectorial approach. BACKGROUND. The precision and limitations of ventricular pacemapping as a method to localize the site of earliest breakthrough of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were investigated in a canine model of experimental myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Forty-one episodes of VT induced in 10 animals were mapped using a standard grid of 64 endocardial and epicardial bipolar electrodes to determine the site of earliest endocardial or epicardial breakthrough of activation during VT. Each of these 64 recording sites was also used for ventricular pacing during sinus rhythm at cycle lengths comparable to those of the VTs. Orthogonal X, Y, and Z Frank electrocardiographic (ECG) leads were recorded during all episodes of VT and ventricular pacing from all sites after the chest was closed in all animals. Surface ECG waveforms corresponding to each VT and each ventricular pacing were compared pairwise by measuring the Euclidean metric difference between the VT and ventricular pacing vectors with the orthogonal ECG leads as their X, Y, and Z components. The pacing site that generated the vector most similar to VT vector (smallest vectorial difference) was defined as the predicted breakthrough site. This predicted site of breakthrough was identical to the actual site of breakthrough determined by activation sequence mapping during VT for only nine VTs (22%). However, for an additional 27 VTs (66%), the observed and predicted breakthrough locations were at adjacent (1 cm or less apart) recording sites. For five VTs (12%), the two sites were remote, the distance between them exceeding 1 cm. CONCLUSIONS. In this model, locating the breakthrough site by pacemapping is exact in only a small minority of VTs. However, when orthogonal surface ECG leads are used for comparison, pacemapping can predict the site of earliest breakthrough during VT with a 1-cm resolution in the majority of VTs. 
Prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in kidney transplant recipients. Cutaneous lesions can be a significant problem in kidney transplant recipients. Factors such as climate and skin types have been implicated as modifiers of these clinical manifestations. With the purpose of determining the prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in a group of Hispanic kidney transplant recipients in a tropical climate, 82 serial unselected patients were examined. Seventy-eight were found to have some type of skin disease. Infections of the skin were the most common, followed by drug-induced changes and malignant or premalignant cutaneous tumors. Except for the preponderance of superficial mycotic infections, the overall results in our population are in agreement with other series. 
Elevated cortical venous pressure in hydrocephalus. To gain a better understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics and their relationship to the cerebrovascular system, normal and naturally hydrocephalic dogs were studied to determine transmantle [lateral ventricle (LV) to subarachnoid space] and transparenchymal [LV to cortical vein (CV)] pressures. Pressure was also measured in the sagittal sinus, cisterna magna, and femoral artery. CV pressure has not previously been measured in hydrocephalus. Ventricular volume was determined by computed tomography. Four groups of animals were studied. In Group 1 (n = 5) transmantle pressure was measured; in Group 2 (n = 5), transparenchymal pressure in normal animals was measured. In Group 3 (n = 5) was measured all the pressures in spontaneously normal animals, and in Group 4 (n = 6) was measured the pressures in hydrocephalic animals. The pressure-volume index and CSF outflow resistance were also measured. LV volume in the normal dogs was 1.3 +/- 0.7 ml and in the hydrocephalic dogs was 5.1 +/- 2.7 ml (P less than 0.005). Although LV, subarachnoid space, and sagittal sinus pressures were elevated in the hydrocephalic dogs (15.1 versus 10.2, 16.4 versus 10.5, and 8.4 versus 5.2 mm Hg, respectively), the transmantle pressure and subarachnoid space to sagittal sinus gradients were not significantly altered. CV pressure was markedly elevated in the hydrocephalic animals (21.5 versus 11.7 mm Hg, P less than 0.005). The pressure-volume index and outflow resistance were not significantly different. These results suggest that an elevated CV pressure plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of hydrocephalus, and that the pathway for CSF absorption includes transcapillary or transvenular absorption of CSF from the interstitial space. 
Repeated intestinal ulcerations in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and high serum antiphospholipid antibody levels. We report the case of a patient with SLE who had repeated ulceration of the small intestine requiring emergency surgery. Pathologic examination revealed microthrombosis and vasculitis at the site of the intestinal ulcers. High levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time coincided with the episodes of intestinal ulceration. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be involved in the development of thrombosis resulting in the repeated episodes of intestinal ulceration in this patient. This possibility should be considered in patients with SLE who have intestinal ulceration and appropriate antithrombotic medication should be administered. 
Chronic and recurrent ankle sprains. Persistent symptoms such as pain, swelling, or giving way after lateral ligament injuries of the ankle are not uncommon. The treating orthopedist must first decide whether the symptoms are related to the ankle instability. Intra-articular or extra-articular injury may occur concomitantly with either a stable or unstable ankle, and careful diagnostic evaluation must be undertaken. Arthroscopy of the unstable ankle in which there is significant pain without demonstrable intra-articular injury by bone scans, CT scans, and MRI studies is indicated, as intra-articular lesions do occur that may result in chronic pain after the ankle has been rendered stable. An arthroscopic lateral ankle capsulodesis procedure has been described with promising early results. Arthroscopic management of an intra-articular pathologic condition in the stable ankle involves removal or excision of offending bone and/or soft tissue. Patients' symptoms can be improved significantly by these approaches, after which there can be a return to a more normal level of function. 
The influence of preoperative shock on outcome in sequential endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia. Sequential endocardial resection was used in 92 consecutive patients to treat ventricular tachycardia. All patients had coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction. All patients had repeated cycles of mapping and resection of arrhythmogenic foci in the normothermic beating heart until ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible. Eighty-six patients (93%) survived to hospital discharge. The survival rate in patients normotensive at the time of operation was 98% and in patients in shock at the time of operation, 43%. By Cox regression analysis, preoperative shock was the significant predictor (p less than 0.001) of operative mortality. Seventy-four of the 86 operative survivors (86%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at initial postoperative electrophysiologic study when receiving no antiarrhythmic drugs. Eighty-three of the 86 operative survivors (97%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at final postoperative electrophysiologic study when using antiarrhythmic drugs as needed. After a median follow-up of 21 months (range 1 to 79 months) there were 4 sudden cardiac deaths, 12 other cardiac deaths, and 3 noncardiac deaths. There were no documented nonfatal episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia after hospital discharge. Use of the sequential endocardial resection technique is effective in curing ventricular tachycardia with low operative morbidity and mortality. 
Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha in childhood chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease. 
Naltrexone in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and in the normal luteal phase. Fifteen young women with a diagnosis of secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea of at least 2 years' duration were given either 50 mg naltrexone daily or placebo, following a randomized double-blind crossover scheme. Seven patients did not menstruate with either therapy. In the other eight, the following results were recorded (mean +/- SD and range): a cycle length of 28.7 +/- 7.6 (12-45) days for naltrexone compared with 30.8 +/- 5.9 (16-43) days for placebo, a follicular phase length of 20.8 +/- 5.4 (14-34) days for naltrexone and 23.2 +/- 4.3 (19-32) days for naltrexone and 8.3 +/- 1.6 (5-10) days for placebo. The number of ovulatory cycles was 18 of 24 (75%) with naltrexone and eight of 24 (33%) with placebo (P less than .05). Most luteal phases were short. In five normally menstruating women, we gave either naltrexone or placebo in the luteal phase using a crossover blinded scheme. Steroidogenesis in the normal luteal phase was not impaired by naltrexone therapy. In functional hypothalamic amenorrheic patients with normal weight, menstruation might be restored by either placebo or naltrexone, but naltrexone provides a clinical and therapeutic advantage by increasing the ovulation rate. 
Air travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Air travel exposes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the risk of severe hypoxemia. We sought to determine the frequency and outcome of airline travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A cohort of 100 patients (76 men and 24 women; age 67 +/- 7 years [mean +/- SD]) with severe chronic pulmonary obstructive disease examined by means of spirometry (forced expiratory volume in the first second, 0.04 +/- 0.35 L), all military retirees, or their dependents, comprised the study population. Forty-four patients traveled by commercial air carrier over a 28-month interval, giving an annual frequency of 18.9% of these patients per year. The group that did not travel by air (n = 56) had a lower mean value for forced expiratory volume in the first second and greater prevalence of home oxygen use than did the group that did travel by air. Twelve of the travelers (27.3%) consulted a physician beforehand. Flights reached foreign destinations for 22.7% of patients. The median duration of the longest flight segment was 3 hours. A minority of patients (34.3%) occupied seats in the smoking sections of aircraft. A majority (56.8%) ambulated aboard the aircraft during flights. Eight patients (18.2%) reported transient symptoms during air travel. We conclude that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travel with appreciable frequency, often without medical consultation, and develop symptoms in some cases. 
An approach to pediatric trauma. Unique anatomic and pathophysiologic aspects of the pediatric patient. Effective evaluation and management of the pediatric trauma patient is based on knowledge of the unique anatomic and pathophysiologic differences in children. An understanding of these differences along with the trauma resuscitation guidelines established by the American College of Surgeons will allow the trauma team to provide systematic and comprehensive resuscitation of the child with multiple injuries. Continued research in the field of pediatric trauma resuscitation and the ongoing efforts of the National Pediatric Trauma Registry will continue to advance our understanding and management of injured children. 
Chronic mitoinhibition during promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis. We have reported previously that orotic acid (OA), a precursor for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, is able to promote carcinogenic process in both liver and duodenum of rats. The present study investigates the possible role of mitoinhibitory effects of OA as being responsible for its promotional effects. Male Fischer 344 rats were given a semisynthetic basal diet (BD) or a diet containing 1% OA for four weeks coupled with 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH), and all animals were then continued on BD for an additional four weeks. This protocol is known to exert a promoting effect on the initiated rat liver. Livers were perfused, and the labeling index (LI) of isolated cultured hepatocytes was monitored. Hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed a BD or 1% OA exhibited in vitro an LI of 39 +/- 2 and 24 +/- 1%, respectively. The lowered in vitro LI was seen even upon exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) (67 +/- 2% in OA-treated livers compared to 91 +/- 2% in hepatocytes from control rat liver). A similar four-week exposure to OA coupled with PH decreased hepatic DNA synthesis induced by a choline-deficient diet in vivo by about 50%. These results indicate that OA is able to decrease the response of normal hepatocytes to growth factors and suggest a possible mechanism of chronic differential mitoinhibition as a basis for promotion induced by OA. 
The decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. 
Hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adducts in human volunteers following acute ethanol ingestion. Rabbit antibodies against albumin-acetaldehyde adduct were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect acetaldehyde-hemoglobin condensates from the blood of 12 volunteers following ingestion of 1.3 to 2.9 g of ethanol per kg body weight during 8 hr. Blood samples were drawn before drinking and between 2 to 46 hr after starting the drinking session. While there were no significant increases in blood acetaldehyde levels in these samples, acetaldehyde-hemoglobin adducts were significantly increased in the samples drawn after ethanol had been eliminated from the body. Administration of ethanol (0.1 g/kg) to an Oriental flusher resulted in an increase both in blood acetaldehyde and the hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adduct levels. These results suggest that acetaldehyde-hemoglobin condensates are formed in vivo following acute ethanol ingestion. Such condensates may be of value to mark alcohol consumption. 
Relationship of stress, distress, and the immunologic response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. BACKGROUND. Many studies have investigated the relationship between psychosocial factors and the susceptibility to infectious diseases. Fewer studies have investigated the relationship between stress and the immunologic response to vaccines. A follow-up study was designed to investigate the relationships between stress, distress, and the antibody response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. METHODS. Eighty-one seronegative medical students received a standard immunization protocol of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Six months after the first dose, corresponding to the induction phase of immunization, each subject completed both the Survey of Life Experiences and the Symptom Distress Check List to assess levels of stress and distress during that period. Three months after the third dose, corresponding to the booster phase of immunization, each subject completed the same questionnaires and was also tested for a quantitative hepatitis B surface antibody titer. Correlations were statistically analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise multifactorial regression analysis. RESULTS. Higher levels of negatively perceived stress, irascibility, depression, and anxiety during the induction phase of immunization were significantly associated with higher peak antibody titers. Together these psychosocial factors accounted for 5.8% of the variance, and were as strong a determinant of peak antibody titer as was age. CONCLUSIONS. In addition to the known vaccine-related and biological factors, psychosocial factors appear to affect the immune response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The positive direction of the correlation raises the question of whether the effect of psychosocial factors on antibody formation is different from their effect on antibody function. 
Endothelium-dependent contraction and relaxation of the human and canine internal mammary artery: studies on bypass graft vasospasm. The internal mammary artery (IMA) is the preferred conduit for coronary artery bypass graft because of superior late patency. However, IMA vasospasm may contribute to myocardial ischemia and early postoperative morbidity. To investigate mechanisms of vasospasm, we compared the reactivity of human and canine IMA segments in vitro to agonists known to release endothelium-derived contracting factor and endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Rings (4 mm in length) of human and canine IMA were studied in organ chambers. Human and canine vascular smooth muscle exhibited comparable contraction to norepinephrine (maximum = 7.55 +/- 0.63 gm and 6.4 +/- 0.90 gm, respectively) and relaxation to sodium nitroprusside. Human and canine IMAs exhibited comparable endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxations to acetylcholine (human) and methacholine (canine). Human and canine IMA also exhibited comparable endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia (to 173.3% +/- 8.1% and 178.9% +/- 16.0% of initial prehypoxic tension; means +/- SEM; n = 12). Endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia in human and canine IMA could be attenuated by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-6) mol/L), a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine metabolism (n = 9 and n = 10 for human and canine; p less than 0.05). These studies establish that the canine is an appropriate model for study of human IMA vascular reactivity and that hypoxia can induce the release of an L-arginine-dependent, endothelium-derived contracting factor in the human and canine IMA. In vivo, the release of endothelium-derived contracting factor in response to hypoxemia may be cause of IMA vasospasm. 
Effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid absorption after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. The effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was investigated after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In 11 cats, SAH was induced by intracisternal application of 1 to 4 ml of fresh autologous blood. Thirty minutes after the experimental SAH, the CSF outflow resistance was found to be elevated from a median of 77 mm Hg/ml/min (range 41.3 to 109 mm Hg/ml/min) to a median of 580 mm Hg/ml/min (range 104 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min). A logarithmic relationship could be demonstrated between the volume of subarachnoid blood and the elevation of the CSF outflow resistance. The intrathecal application of 2 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), which is a fibrinolytic substance suitable for lysis of subarachnoid blood clots in man, resulted in an almost total restoration of CSF absorption after experimental SAH. The CSF outflow resistance after SAH was lowered by application of rt-PA from a median of 1028.05 mm Hg/ml/min (range 394 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min) to 79 mm Hg/ml/min (range 56.7 to 223 mm Hg/ml/min). It is concluded that the impairment of CSF absorption after SAH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of post-hemorrhagic vasospasm. 
Erythroleukemia in a child associated with monosomy 7. A case of erythroleukemia (EL) associated with monosomy 7 is reported. The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of monosomy 7 was made. An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Chemotherapy was started with low dose cytarabine. However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of pneumonia. Our case shows that monosomy 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid neoplasm. 
Delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula in a patient with traumatic brain injury. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are rare complications of traumatic brain injury, facial trauma and postorthognathic surgery. A high level of clinical suspicion is necessary, particularly for patients who are unable to communicate, to establish the diagnosis. A case of delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula after traumatic brain injury is presented. This case illustrates that early recognition of this disorder is crucial to prevent significant morbidity. 
Chronic reversal of hemifield loss after intraocular pressure lowering in advanced glaucoma. Lowering intraocular pressure in two cases of severe glaucoma was associated with a chronic reversal of hemifield loss, as documented by automated threshold perimetry. In the first case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision expanded to 40 degrees in both hemifields eight months after intraocular pressure lowering by filtration surgery. The mean deviation of the central 30 degrees field improved by more than 14dB or 1.4 log units. To our knowledge, this case represents the greatest degree of reversal of chronic visual field loss reported in the literature. In the second case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision slowly expanded to 40 degrees in the inferior hemifield over a three-year period. 
Spinal cord protection during aortic occlusion: efficacy of intrathecal tetracaine. Spinal cord ischemia and resultant paraplegia are devastating sequelae in up to 40% of patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We investigated the effect of intrathecal tetracaine on the neurological sequelae of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion with aortic occlusion. Cocaine-derived anesthetics (lidocaine and its analogues) have been shown to decrease neuronal cell metabolism and also have specific neuronal membrane stabilizing effects. New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and spinal cord ischemia was then induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. Animals were divided into six treatment groups. Tetracaine (groups 2 and 4) or normal saline solution (group 5) was administered intrathecally before aortic cross-clamping. Groups 1 and 3 functioned as controls. Group 6 animals received intravenous thiopental. Rabbits were classified as either neurologically normal or injured (paralyzed or paretic). Among controls, 25 minutes of aortic occlusion produced varied neurological sequelae (group 1, 3/6 injured, 50%) whereas 30 minutes resulted in more consistent injury (group 3, 5/6 injured, 83%). All rabbits that received intrathecal saline solution were paralyzed (group 5, 4/4 injured, 100%). Animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion of 30 minutes (group 4) showed significantly better preservation of neurological function (6/7 normal, 86%) than controls and saline-treated animals (groups 3 and 5). All animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion for 25 minutes (group 2) showed no signs of injury (5/5 normal, 100%), but this was not significant versus controls (group 1). Intravenous thiopental (group 6, 5/5 injured, 100%) had no beneficial effect. Intrathecal tetracaine significantly and dramatically abrogated the neurological injury secondary to spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion after aortic occlusion at 30 minutes in the rabbit model. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--Sao Paulo, Brazil. Ninety-two patients with IIB osteosarcoma of the extremities were treated with intraarterial (IA) cisplatinum (CDDP) followed by surgery [amputation (61.6%) or resection with endoprosthesis (38.4%)]. Postoperative chemotherapy alternating adriamycin and CDDP was used. The total three-year survival was 62.1%, and the disease-free survival was 41.1%. The pathologic evaluation of the degree of tumor necrosis in response to the IA CDDP showed that in 53.2%, the necrosis was over 90%. The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors has shown that the highest survival was among females with tumors smaller than 15 cm. Patients with lesions equal to or larger than 15 cm were three times as likely to die of the disease. A second, more aggressive study is now underway, in which high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is preoperatively combined with adriamycin and CDDP. Following operation, ifosfamide is added to the cases with a smaller degree of tumor necrosis, while the other group of patients will continue with HDMTX, in addition to CDDP and adriamycin (these last two drugs are used in both arms). Until now, complete remission has been achieved in 82% and 86%, respectively, with a follow-up examination varying from four to 26 months (average, 14 months). This is of extreme importance, because the majority of the authors' patients have tumors at initial evaluation larger than 10 cm in diameter. 
Expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an in situ analysis. The c-myc gene plays a pivotal role in mediating the competence state for cell cycle transversion. This biologic role is in contradiction to reports of elevated expression of the gene in multiple myeloma, a tumor with restricted self-renewal capacity. To more clearly define the role of this gene in plasma cells of myeloma patients, c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or oncoprotein expression were semiquantitatively analyzed on the single cell level in 19 cases of multiple myeloma, among them 1 biclonal case and 1 case with coexistent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Performing anti-sense/mRNA in situ hybridization, mature c-myc gene transcripts were detected in 92% (12 of 13) of cases and could definitely be attributed to the plasma cells by our study. The number of Ki 67-positive plasma cells actively passing the cell cycle was less than 1% and independent of c-myc gene expression. However, because the presence of the 152-c-MYC epitope was correlated to extent of marrow plasmacytosis (r = .64; P = .043) and content of plasmablasts (P = .09), the c-myc gene might serve a function different from proliferative activity, but also associated with tumor cell mass. In CLL cells (21 of 22 cases) and their benign counterparts, ie, bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, the anti-sense/c-myc mRNA hybridization signals remained below the threshold considered as cutpoint between negative and positive. The low amounts of c-myc transcripts were correlated to neither stage of disease (P = .52) nor lymphocyte counts (P = .24). Because the numbers of peripheral blood lymphoma cells were independent of tumor mass and of c-myc gene transcripts expressed, peripheral blood lymphocytosis might more likely reflect homing processes than proliferative activity in CLL. 
The diabetic foot: consequences of delayed treatment and referral. The pathophysiology of foot problems in diabetic patients is poorly understood by many physicians. Two major factors that frequently lead to a delay in appropriate treatment with subsequent limb loss are failure to appreciate the presence and severity of underlying infection and attribution of gangrene of the toe and forefoot to microvascular disease. To evaluate the consequences of delayed recognition and treatment, we reviewed the records of 55 diabetic patients with localized gangrene or infection of the forefoot in 62 limbs, treated consecutively on a single vascular surgical service over a 2-year period using a standard protocol. All appropriately treated neuropathic ulcers and forefoot infections healed in patients with palpable pedal pulses. If foot pulses were absent and arteriography confirmed large-vessel occlusive disease, foot lesions and infections likewise healed if concomitant revascularization was done. In our series, 33 bypasses were required because of severe atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Only one patient had "unreconstructable" arterial disease. Limb salvage was 86% at a mean follow-up of 12.4 months. In 16 of the patients (29%), there was a prolonged delay between initial treatment and referral for definitive care. The specific causes of delay were underestimation of the severity of foot infection in 10 patients, and lack of recognition of ischemia due to large-vessel occlusive disease in six. These delays led to more proximal levels of amputation in six patients, including three below-knee amputations in patients with limbs that were initially salvageable. 
Efficacy and toxicity of pentostam against Panamanian mucosal leishmaniasis. We tested the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended treatment for mucosal leishmaniasis in 16 Panamanians with disease due to Leishmania braziliensis panamensis. Disease was mild in this population because it was limited to the nasal mucosa and only one patient had septal perforation. The patients were administered 20 mg antimony (in the form of Pentostam) per kg intravenously each day for 28 days. Ten patients completed therapy and were cured at 12 month follow-up. Three patients completed therapy, healed their lesions, but relapsed at the six or 12 month follow-up. Three patients terminated therapy prematurely because of liver enzyme elevations in conjunction with either EKG abnormalities or musculoskeletal complaints; none of these patients were healed. This study indicates that in patients with mild mucosal leishmaniasis, the WHO regimen is curative in 77% patients who complete treatment and in 63% of all patients. 
Intracoronary thrombus formation causes focal vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries in patients with coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. Experimental studies have demonstrated that intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation may induce marked vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries with endothelial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS. To examine the effects of intracoronary thrombus formation on coronary vasomotor tone of human epicardial arteries in vivo, we studied 15 patients who developed intracoronary thrombi adherent to the guide wire during balloon dilatation. Epicardial artery luminal area was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography proximal and distal to the site of intracoronary thrombus formation and in a reference vessel before and after thrombus formation as well as after intracoronary injection of 0.2-0.3 mg nitroglycerin. All artery segments distal to the site of thrombus formation showed vasoconstriction with a luminal area reduction of -27.4 +/- 17.1% (p less than 0.001), whereas proximal vessel segments and reference vessels not manipulated during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty did not demonstrate any significant luminal area changes during thrombus formation. Angiographic measurements after advancing the guide wire with the adherent thrombus (performed in six of the 15 patients) revealed in all patients that vasoconstriction did develop at a new site distal to the thrombus persistence of the initial vasoconstriction now residing proximal to the thrombus. Thus, there was a sequential association between thrombus formation and subsequent distal vasoconstriction. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin abolished the thrombus-induced vasoconstriction. No significant luminal area changes were observed in 20 patients without angiographic evidence of intracoronary thrombus formation. CONCLUSIONS. Intracoronary thrombus formation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty causes focal vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries in patients with coronary artery disease. Although caution must be advised in the extrapolation of this phenomenon, which was observed in a manipulated artery during coronary angioplasty, the vasoconstrictor response to intracoronary thrombus formation in vivo may play an important role in the dynamic mechanisms of acute coronary heart disease syndromes. 
Mitochondrial encephalopathies: molecular genetic diagnosis from blood samples. Point mutations of mitochondrial DNA have been described in the muscle of patients with syndromes of myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibres (MERRF) and of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We have found the MERRF mutation in members of 6 British kindreds; 2 of these had unusual phenotypes but all index patients had myoclonus. The MELAS mutation was detected in 17 patients from 16 families, who had a wide range of clinical features that particularly affected the central nervous system; stroke-like episodes were observed in 10.3 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations did not have ragged red fibres on muscle biopsy, generally considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. In all 6 patients with the MERRF mutation, and 10 of 11 with the MELAS mutation, the genetic defect was easily detected in blood cells as well as muscle (blood samples were not available in 6 patients with MELAS mutations in muscle). Molecular genetic analysis of blood samples represents an inexpensive and reliable screening test for mitochondrial encephalopathies, and use of such techniques could influence diagnosis and genetic counselling in patients with seizure disorders and young-onset stroke. 
Overview: rationale of thrombolysis in treating acute myocardial infarction. Treatment of coronary thrombosis with thrombolytic agents was first introduced in the 1950s. Clinical trials, primarily with streptokinase during the 1960s and 1970s, addressed the effects of thrombolysis on mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction, but were inconclusive and largely ignored. In 1976, Chazov et al. from the Soviet Union demonstrated that intracoronary streptokinase could produce prompt recanalization of a totally occluded infarct-related artery. In 1980, DeWood et al. demonstrated that 87% of patients with classic Q-wave myocardial infarction had total occlusion from coronary thrombosis of the infarct-related artery when studied during the first 4 hours of their infarction and that 65% of these arteries were still occluded when patients were studied between 12 and 24 hours after infarction. These observations stimulated renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Mortality trials have subsequently demonstrated that agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex remarkably reduce early mortality rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction when treatment is instituted within the first 6 hours of infarction. Benefit has yet to be demonstrated, however, in patients with acute myocardial infarction characterized by ST-segment depression. This whole area is currently under study by the TIMI investigators. TIMI-3B is a mortality study in which patients with either non-Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina with rest pain are randomly assigned to receive either tissue plasminogen activator or placebo. Results of this trial will help us in the future to determine the appropriate role of thrombolytic therapy in treating acute ischemic syndromes other than transmural myocardial infarction. 
Expression of HIV-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid detected by the polymerase chain reaction and its correlation with central nervous system disease. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect HIV-1 sequences (gag, pol, and env) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 53 HIV-1-positive patients and the results correlated with clinical evidence of neurological disease. Twenty-three out of 24 patients with neurological disease had HIV-1-specific sequences in CSF compared with four out of 20 asymptomatic patients who had no evidence of neurological involvement. The detection of HIV RNA sequences by PCR in the CSF of HIV-positive patients may provide early, rapid and direct evidence of neurological involvement in asymptomatic subjects. 
Autocrine stimulation by erythropoietin and autonomous growth of human erythroid leukemic cells in vitro. Autonomous colony formation is a frequent event in erythroleukemia. In 13 cases of early erythroid leukemias, we investigated whether erythropoietin (Epo) autocrine stimulation was responsible for the growth factor autonomy. Epo transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in cells from one patient. These cells also expressed an Epo receptor (1,000 receptors per cell) with a 420-pM affinity and Epo was detected in the supernatant of cultured cells. In 8 of the 13 cases, Epo transcripts were revealed by the polymerase chain reaction ranging from 0.5 to 500 copies per cell. In situ hybridization proved that these Epo transcripts were present in the blast cells. No Epo gene abnormalities were detected by Southern blotting. In two cases, leukemic cells were grown in the presence of Epo-neutralizing antibodies or Epo antisense oligomers. In one case, the antibody significantly reduced autonomous growth. In contrast, the antibody had no effect in the second case in which blast cells transcribed the Epo gene at a low level. However, Epo antisense oligomers partially inhibited autonomous growth. This inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous Epo. Overall, these results suggest that an extracellular or intracellular autocrine Epo stimulation occurs in some cases of erythroid malignancies. 
Edematous pancreatitis associated with intravenous pentamidine. A 37-year-old black man with presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was treated with systemic IV pentamidine had fatal pancreatitis and massive hepatomegaly. Fatal pancreatitis can occur with no hemorrhagic changes seen at autopsy. Awareness of the relationship between pentamidine and pancreatitis should be emphasized. With current clinical trials testing other routes of administration, fatal complications associated with IV pentamidine therapy will be minimized. 
A component of calcium-activated potassium channels encoded by the Drosophila slo locus. Calcium-activated potassium channels mediate many biologically important functions in electrically excitable cells. Despite recent progress in the molecular analysis of voltage-activated K+ channels, Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels have not been similarly characterized. The Drosophila slowpoke (slo) locus, mutations of which specifically abolish a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current in muscles and neurons, provides an opportunity for molecular characterization of these channels. Genomic and complementary DNA clones from the slo locus were isolated and sequenced. The polypeptide predicted by slo is similar to voltage-activated K+ channel polypeptides in discrete domains known to be essential for function. Thus, these results indicate that slo encodes a structural component of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 
The effects of benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists and partial inverse agonists on acute hepatic encephalopathy in the rat. Two benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists (Ro 15-4513, Ro 15-3505) and one benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist (flumazenil) were administered to rats with hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver ischemia. Significant improvement (P less than 0.002) of both the clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy and the electroencephalographic abnormalities was observed after administration of the benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists: comatose rats with no spontaneous righting reflex regained consciousness immediately after injection of the drug. Only slight improvement in clinical hepatic encephalopathy grade was seen after administration of 25 mg/kg of flumazenil. The present data strongly support a role of increased gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone in the pathogenesis of acute hepatic encephalopathy and provide a rationale for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists to restore consciousness in hepatic encephalopathy in humans in the near future. 
The effect of palliative radiation therapy on epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. The efficacy of palliative radiation therapy in the treatment of spinal cord and cauda equina compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma was evaluated in 38 sites in 35 patients treated between 1970 and 1990. All patients had radiographic documentation of epidural compression. The median dose of radiation therapy was 2850 cGy (range, 500 to 4000 cGy), with daily fractions ranging from 200 to 800 cGy. Twenty-eight sites in 26 patients were evaluable 1 month after completion of radiation therapy, and symptoms responded completely in 11 of 28 (39%) sites. Fourteen sites (46%) showed a partial response of symptoms. Response lasting until death was documented in 21 of 26 patients (81%). Patients receiving a total dose of 3000 cGy or greater were more likely to achieve a complete response than those receiving less than 3000 cGy (62% versus 20%) by univariate (P = 0.025) and multivariate (P = 0.048) analyses. A treatment program of radiation therapy and corticosteroids is effective in palliating the symptoms of epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. It is recommended to deliver an accelerated course of radiation therapy to a dose of 3000 cGy or greater without exceeding spinal cord tolerance (e.g., 3000 cGy in ten fractions at 300 cGy per fraction). 
Genes for epilepsy mapped in the mouse. The neurological mutant mouse strain E1 is a model for complex partial seizures in humans. The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3. 
Treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis with oral methotrexate. Ten patients with well-documented primary sclerosing cholangitis who had no signs of portal hypertension or liver failure were treated with oral pulse methotrexate for at least 1 yr. The methotrexate dose averaged 15 mg/wk (0.2 mg/kg/wk). All six patients who were symptomatic became asymptomatic within 1-5 months of starting methotrexate. Biochemical tests of liver function improved in all patients. The alkaline phosphatase value decreased from a mean (+/-SD) of 373 +/- 210 IU to 140 +/- 77 IU (p = 0.0008), the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from 115 +/- 74 to 76 +/- 79 U/L (p = 0.005), and the mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value from 88 +/- 37 to 57 +/- 40 U/L (p = 0.007). The improvement in mean bilirubin (1.19 +/- 1.41 to 0.67 +/- 0.25 mg/dl) was not statistically significant. Serum albumin remained normal (3.97 +/- 0.46 to 4.22 +/- 0.36 g/dl). Nine patients had a repeat liver biopsy after 1 yr of methotrexate therapy. Six of the nine showed histologic improvement with a reduction in inflammation. The other three liver biopsies were unchanged. Repeat cholangiograms were done in six patients. Two showed improvement. In one of the two, who had early disease, the cholangiogram became normal, and the liver biopsy was markedly improved. The other four cholangiograms showed no progression of disease. No toxicity was detected in these 10 patients. These results suggest that low-dose oral methotrexate therapy is effective in primary sclerosing cholangitis if treatment is begun before signs of portal hypertension or liver failure occur. 
Molecular basis for elliptocytosis associated with glycophorin C and D deficiency in the Leach phenotype. Glycophorin C (GPC) and glycophorin D (GPD) are highly glycosylated integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes encoded by the same gene and associated with expression of Gerbich blood group system antigens. GPC/D deficiency (the Leach phenotype) is a rare condition usually found after identification of Gerbich blood group system antibodies in persons undergoing prenatal or pretransfusion evaluation. In all cases, the Leach phenotype has been associated with elliptocytosis. Characterization of the molecular basis of this phenotype in three previously uninvestigated families has shown that the most common genetic basis of GPC/D deficiency is deletion of exons 3 and 4 of the GPC gene. However, in one family, the Leach phenotype appeared due to a deletion of one nucleotide in exon 3, causing a frameshift mutation in the messenger RNA and premature generation of a stop codon. The GPC and GPD protein sequences are therefore interrupted in the extracellular domain and probably intracellularly degraded. 
A prospective evaluation of elevated serum theophylline concentrations to determine if high concentrations are predictable. PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively whether serum theophylline concentrations of 25 mg/L and greater were predictable (and presumably preventable) by use of basic pharmacokinetic calculations. DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with a serum theophylline concentration of at least 25.0 mg/L were evaluated initially and if subsequent elevated theophylline concentrations occurred. INTERVENTIONS: The predicted steady-state serum theophylline concentration was calculated from the dosage rate divided by the predicted clearance to determine how many elevated concentrations (greater than 20 mg/L) were predictable. Predicted clearances were 0.04 L/kg/hour for normal subjects less than 70 years of age and 0.02 L/kg/hour for patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or liver disease. Estimated clearances were determined and compared with predicted clearances. If patients did not have steady-state concentrations, additional calculations were made. MAIN RESULTS: From 6,368 consecutive theophylline determinations, 69 (1.08%) samples from 55 patients were 25 mg/L or higher. Predictably high concentrations occurred in 23 of 33 (69.7%) fully evaluable cases. These concentrations occurred because of a failure to consider decreased elimination clearance from congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or hepatic disease. Five fatalities occurred, and in two cases, theophylline appeared to contribute to the patient's death. Three other patients experienced syncope. The predicted elimination clearance of theophylline of 0.02 L/kg/hour was too high in eight patients over 70 years old with cardiac or pulmonary disease. Nursing and pharmacy oversights were identified as three patients were given two theophylline products simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Most elevated theophylline concentrations are predictable (and preventable) by basic pharmacokinetic calculations. Patients experiencing elevated theophylline concentrations often had comorbid conditions and were greater than 60 years of age. The dosage rate of theophylline (mg/hour) can be estimated from predicted clearance (L/kg/hour) times desired steady-state serum concentration (mg/L). 
Perineal excision of the rectum for prolapse in the elderly. A perineal operation is described for the treatment of rectal prolapse. The surgery improves functional outcome by correcting the anatomical anomalies associated with the condition. In 17 elderly women, there was one perioperative death and one recurrence. At a median follow-up of 24 months, 13 patients were able to control solid stool and three were profoundly incontinent. The operation may be an alternative to the more invasive abdominal procedures for the treatment of the majority of patients with prolapse. 
Primary pulmonary hypertension. Its association with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Four patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, microangiopathic hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia were seen at the Charleston (WVa) Area Medical Center between 1983 and 1988. Characteristic laboratory and clinical features of these patients were the following: mild anemia, reticulocytosis, low serum haptoglobin value, microangiopathic red blood cell changes on peripheral blood smear, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, normal clotting studies (ie, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen), negative direct Coombs' test, negative glucose water test, normal serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, lack of improvement of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia in response to vasodilators or calcium channel blockers, and severe plexiform lesions in the pulmonary vasculature with fibrin deposition at autopsy. The hemolysis and thrombocytopenia probably developed as a result of flow through the fibrin deposition in the plexiform lesions in the pulmonary circulation and subsequent shearing of red blood cells and platelets. 
Pharmacokinetics of esmolol in children. The pharmacokinetics and concentration-response relationships of intravenous esmolol were investigated in 20 children undergoing indicated cardiac electrophysiologic testing. A loading dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes. An infusion of esmolol was initiated and dosage was titrated until beta-blockade occurred. Serial esmolol blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of the data revealed the following parameter estimates (mean +/- SD): volume of distribution at steady state, 2.0 +/- 1.4 L/kg; total body clearance, 321.2 +/- 238.8 ml/kg/min; and terminal elimination half-life, 4.5 +/- 2.1 minutes. There was a significant correlation between mean esmolol concentrations and mean percentage of reductions of mean arterial pressures and heart rates at each sample time (p less than 0.001). The doses of esmolol required for beta-blockade (mean +/- SD, 535 +/- 180 micrograms/kg/min) in children were considerably higher than those typically used in adults. Esmolol should prove useful in children in the acute management of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. 
Activity of esorubicin in recurrent malignant lymphoma: a Southwest Oncology Group study. A phase II trial of esorubicin (4' deoxydoxorubicin) was conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group in 88 assessable patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD) at the time of first relapse. Esorubicin was administered at two dose levels: 25 mg/m2 for patients at risk for excessive myelosuppression, and at 30 mg/m2 for all others at 21-day intervals. Overall, 33 of 88 patients (38%) responded to treatment including three complete remissions (CRs; 3%) and 30 partial remissions (PRs; 34%), with the median duration of response lasting 6.2 months. Response rates did not differ significantly by histologic subtype: 31% of 26 patients with favorable NHL, 33% of 43 patients with unfavorable NHL, and 58% of 19 patients with HD. Twelve of 33 responding patients (36%) had relatively durable remissions lasting from 1 to more than 4 years. Leukopenia (less than 3,000 cells per microliter) was seen in 65 of 88 patients (74%) and was severe (less than 1,000 cells per microliter) in 20 of 88 patients (23%). Clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure were not seen and the ejection fraction (EF) fell 10% to 20% in three patients. Esorubicin is an active agent in patients with NHL or HD at the time of first relapse. 
Underdiagnosis and poor documentation of acute confusional states in elderly hip fracture patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of diagnosis and documentation of acute confusional states (ACS) in the medical records of patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: The diagnosis of ACS in two prospective clinical studies was compared to its diagnosis in the medical records of the same patients on the same hospitalization. In order to determine if the simultaneous prospective study influences the diagnostic and documentary practices evidenced in the medical records, a further comparison was done by reviewing medical records of two series of patients seen some years prior to the prospective studies. SETTING: Patients with femoral neck fractures treated at a department of orthopedic surgery in a university hospital and one retrospective control sample from a department of general surgery in a county hospital. SUBJECTS: Two prospective samples of patients 65 years and older treated for femoral neck fractures (n = 111 and n = 57, respectively) and two earlier retrospective samples (n = 66 and n = 68, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All comparisons showed that both physicians and nurses diagnosed ACS unsatisfactorily and documented the patients' mental status poorly. The analysis of the two retrospective medical record control samples gave the same results. Neither the physicians nor the nurses used any kind of diagnostic instrument to detect cognitive disorders in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is a common and severe complication in elderly people treated for femoral neck fractures. Acute confusional states have, by definition, one or more causes that can often be identified and treated. Poor assessment and documentation is a threat to the patients as a correct diagnosis of ACS is a prerequisite for further assessment of its underlying causes and the consequent necessary medical and nursing care. 
Preventability of emergent hospital readmission To determine whether emergent readmissions within 30 days of discharge are potentially preventable, we prospectively studied all readmissions to the medical service of a university teaching hospital during a 4-month period. The 327 readmissions, including 42 patients who were readmitted more than once during the study period, accounted for 12% of medical admissions. Nearly 75% of readmissions were due to previously diagnosed medical conditions; complications of drugs or therapeutic procedures caused 29%, and patient compliance contributed to 11%. Three reviewers judged 28 (9%) readmissions to be potentially preventable. These 28 readmissions constituted 1% of all admissions to the medical service and did not result in any fatalities, indicating that the quality of care was generally very good. One third of the potentially preventable readmissions were thought to be related to medical system failures, one third to an unfulfilled hope that the patient would improve after discharge, and one third to other suboptimal judgements in evaluation or treatment. Of the 28 potentially preventable readmissions, 89% occurred within 10 days of discharge. We conclude that potentially preventable readmissions would nearly always be detected by review of readmissions within 10 days of discharge and that many may be amenable to systematic interventions such as standardized predischarge assessment and better coordination of post-discharge follow-up. 
Role of lymphadenectomy in renal cell carcinoma. A hilar or limited lymph node dissection will not remove the primary lymphatic drainage area of either kidney. For a lymphadenectomy to have a therapeutic benefit, an extended dissection is required, particularly for right-sided tumors. An extended lymphadenectomy may not be justified in all patients with renal cell carcinoma, particularly those with small tumors (who rarely have lymphatic disease) or grossly positive nodes (who have a high risk of existing distant metastases). For some patients with T3 or V+ tumors and palpably normal retroperitoneal nodes, an extended nodal dissection may resect microscopically involved nodes and result in an improved survival rate. This hypothesis will not be tested appropriately until a randomized controlled study is performed. 
Torsion dystonia genes in two populations confined to a small region on chromosome 9q32-34. Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) is characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Most familial forms of ITD display autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance. Linkage analysis has been previously used to localize a dystonia gene to the 9q32-34 region in a large non-Jewish family and in a group of Ashkenazi Jewish families. Utilizing GT repeat polymorphisms from this region, here we demonstrate that the gene causing dystonia in Ashkenazi Jews can be localized to the 11-cM interval between AK1 and D9S10. Linkage analysis in the non-Jewish family is also consistent with occurrence of the gene in this region, although positive lod scores extend over a greater than 20-cM interval in that family. These results set the stage for positional cloning of the dystonia gene. Currently there are no known candidate genes in this region. 
Prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation with magnesium sulfate after coronary artery bypass grafting. Ninety-nine consecutive consenting patients were prospectively entered into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of postoperative magnesium therapy on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias after elective coronary artery bypass grafting. No patient had documented or suspected arrhythmias preoperatively. Forty-nine patients received 178 mEq of magnesium given over the first 4 postoperative days, and 50 patients received only placebo. The clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. The preoperative mean serum magnesium concentration was similar in both study (1.90 mEq/L) and placebo (1.90 mEq/L) groups. The mean postoperative serum magnesium concentration in study patients was significantly elevated over postoperative days 1 through 4 when compared with preoperative levels (p less than 0.001). The postoperative mean serum magnesium concentration in control patients declined and remained significantly depressed through postoperative day 3 (p less than 0.001), but increased to preoperative levels by postoperative day 4. The mean serum magnesium concentration was significantly greater in the study patients as compared with the control patients over postoperative days 1 through 4 (p less than 0.001). Although there was no significant difference between groups with respect to episodes of ventricular arrhythmias, there was a significant decrease in the number of episodes of atrial fibrillation in the group receiving magnesium therapy (p less than 0.02). There were no recognized adverse effects of magnesium therapy. Prophylactic magnesium administration seems to lessen the incidence and severity of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. 
U-78517F: a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation with activity in experimental brain injury and ischemia. U-78517F (2-[4-[2,6-di-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl] methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol, dihydrochloride), which combines the antioxidant ring portion of alpha-tocopherol together with the amine of the previously described 21-aminosteroids (e.g., U-74006F), is a novel inhibitor of iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. U-78517F was found to have a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.6 microM against 200 microM ferrous chloride-initiated lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates, compared to 8 microM for U-74006F, 28 microM for alpha-tocopherol and 43 microM for the ring portion of alpha-tocopherol (i.e., trolox). Both stereoisomers of the racemic U-78517F proved to be equally active antioxidants. Against lipid peroxidation initiated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase, U-78517F was even more potent, with an IC50 of 0.01 microM. U-78517F was also observed to protect cultured mouse spinal neurons against iron-induced damage, with an IC50 of approximately 0.5 microM. When administered to male CF-1 mice i.v. at 5 min after a severe concussive head injury. U-78517F produced a dose-related improvement in the 1-hr neurological recovery. The minimum effective i.v. dose was 1.0 micrograms/kg. Measurement of U-78517 concentrations in the brains of mice after administration of a 10-mg/kg i.v. dose revealed effective antioxidant levels for as long as 2 hr. Evidence of an in vivo antioxidant action was provided by the attenuation of iron-induced blood-brain barrier disruption (i.e., Evans' blue extravasation) in rats pretreated with U-78517F. 
5-HT2 receptor antagonists and migraine therapy. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, and several drugs with potent 5-HT2 receptor blocking activity (methysergide, pizotifen, cyproheptadine and mianserin) have been recognized as being clinically effective in migraine prophylaxis, although the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (the principal agent used to identify 5-HT2 receptor-mediated actions) seems to be ineffective in migraine. Pizotifen is the most widely used 5-HT2 receptor antagonist in migraine prophylaxis, because of its superior efficacy compared with cyproheptadine, and because the incidence and severity of adverse effects with pizotifen is lower compared with methysergide and mianserin. These agents have additional antagonistic effects at histamine H1, muscarinic cholinergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic and dopamine receptors, but drugs which are selective for these non-5-HT receptors appear to be of no benefit in migraine. Actions mediated by 5-HT2 receptors which could be of relevance to migraine comprise cranial vasoconstriction, increased cranial capillary permeability and platelet aggregation, and some central nervous system effects and neuroendocrine functions. Although pizotifen, cyproheptadine and mianserin are considered to be relatively specific for 5-HT2 receptors, these agents and methysergide all share a high affinity for 5-HT1C binding sites; ketanserin, however, has little affinity for these sites, thus activation of 5-HT1C receptors may be an important step in the pathogenesis of migraine. It is not yet known which 5-HT1C receptor-mediated actions of 5-HT are relevant to migraine, but some behavioural actions and cranial vasodilatation via release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be involved. 
Early gastric cancer: a clinicopathologic study. We report our experience, between 1973 and 1989 of 302 patients with gastric cancer in a Dutch general hospital. In 144 (47.7%) of them gastric resection was performed. Twenty-eight patients had early gastric cancer (EGC) (9.3% of the entire series and 19.4% of the resected specimens). Multicentricity of EGC was noted in 3 patients (10.7%). The incidence of EGC decreased slightly during consecutive 8-year intervals. There were 16 men and 12 women (mean age 64 and 66 years, respectively). Standard biphasic contrast radiographic studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract diagnosed or suggested malignancy in all but one patient. Endoscopy with directed biopsy diagnosed malignancy in all patients. Twenty-one lesions (67.7%) were localized to the antral region. Type IIc was most frequent (38.7%). There were 21 intestinal-type and 10 diffuse-type EGC by the Lauren classification. The incidence of intestinal-type EGC decreased during two consecutive 8-year periods. All type I and IIa lesions were of the intestinal type, whereas all diffuse-type EGCs were either type IIc or III. Lymph node metastasis was observed in 9.7% of the lesions. The incidence of lymph node metastasis increased from 0% in mucosal cancer to 20% in submucosal cancer. The overall 5-year survival rate was 91.3%: (diffuse type 100% and intestinal type 85.7%). The 5-year survival rate was 100% in mucosal cancer and 81.8% in submucosal cancer. 
Radiation therapy as local treatment in Ewing's sarcoma. Results of the Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. The Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies, CESS 81 and CESS 86, are multiinstitutional trials with more than 80 participating institutions from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland. Treatment consists of four courses of multiagent chemotherapy and local therapy. Local therapy was not randomized and was either radical surgery or resection plus postoperative irradiation or definitive radiation therapy. Here results according to local therapy have been analyzed for 93 protocol patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who have been recruited in CESS 81 from January 1981 to February 1985 and 122 protocol patients recruited in CESS 86 from January 1986 to November 1989. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 55% in CESS 81 and 62% in CESS 86. In CESS 81, the RFS was better for surgically treated than for irradiated patients. In this study there was an extremely high incidence of local failures (50%) after definitive irradiation. In CESS 86, however, the results after radiation therapy have been improved markedly (3-year RFS 67% after radiation therapy, 65% after surgery, and 62% after resection plus irradiation). Possible explanations for the improvement of radiotherapeutic results are as follows: selections for patients for radiation therapy, start of local therapy, and quality of radiation therapy. In CESS 86, irradiated patients were randomized to receive either conventionally fractionated irradiation with less intense chemotherapy or hyperfractionated irradiation with simultaneous chemotherapy. There was no difference in treatment results at the time of analysis. The authors conclude that selection of patients for local treatment modalities and quality of treatment performance has an impact on local and overall treatment results in ES. 
Myointimal hyperplasia as a result of balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The balloon-tipped embolectomy catheter is widely utilized in the treatment of arterial thromboemboli, significantly improving mortality and limb salvage rates. However, early and late complications related to catheter-tip injury and balloon trauma continue to occur and compromise the results of surgical intervention. Myointimal hyperplasia is an example of an unusual late complication induced by balloon-related arterial wall trauma. Myointimal hyperplasia is a commonly recognized healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury but is rarely reported after balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The extensive nature of the injury increases the incidence of limb loss. The pathophysiologic nature of this process is reviewed, and pertinent structural details such as intimal thickening and disruption of the internal elastic lamina are presented. The pathogenesis of myointimal hyperplasia suggests guidelines for catheter use during embolectomy that may further reduce the incidence of this unusual complication. 
Effects of late administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator on left ventricular remodeling and function after myocardial infarction. To evaluate the effects of late thrombolysis on left ventricular volume and function in acute myocardial infarction, two-dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide angiography were performed before discharge and after 1 year of follow-up study in 34 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. Of these, 10 admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 h from the onset of symptoms were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (Group A) and 24 admitted between 4 and 8 h after onset were randomly assigned to receive either rt-PA (Group B, n = 12) or conventional therapy (Group C, n = 12). Seven to 10 days after admission, all patients underwent cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Patency of the infarct-related vessel was 70% in Group A, 66% in Group B and 33% in Group C and the average Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) coronary perfusion grade was 1.9 +/- 0.8 for Group A, 1.6 +/- 1.0 for Group B and 0.84 +/- 0.95 for Group C (Group A versus Group C p less than 0.01; Group B versus Group C p less than 0.05). At predischarge evaluation, mean left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for both); mean left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Group B and Group A (p less than 0.05 for both). At 1 year follow-up study, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes remained higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.05 for both) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for end-systolic volume and p less than 0.001 for end-diastolic volume); ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Groups A and B (p less than 0.05 for both); during exercise, it increased more in Group A than in Group C (p less than 0.01). Comparison of data obtained before discharge and at the 1 year follow-up study revealed a significant differences in end-systolic volume (p less than 0.05) in Group C patients and in end-diastolic volume in patients in Groups B (p less than 0.05) and C (p less than 0.001). The beneficial effect of late thrombolysis with rt-PA may be related to a reduction in myocardial expansion and thus to a favorable influence on postinfarction left ventricular remodeling. 
Animal models of fulminant hepatic failure. The six requirements for a satisfactory animal model of fulminant hepatic failure are reversibility, reproducibility, death from liver failure, a therapeutic window, a large animal model, and minimal hazard to personnel. Different models may be required to evaluate the various types of liver failure seen in man. The available models include surgical anheptic and devascularization procedures, as well as hepatotoxic drug administration using agents such as carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, or galactosamine. Currently combined surgical and drug models appear to provide the best model but the search for the ideal models continues. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor in childhood. A diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. We describe a case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the lower abdomen in a young child. The urinary bladder and abdominal wall were involved, and the pseudotumor simulated a malignant sarcomatous tumor. Surgical excision was undertaken, and the outcome was favorable. This rare tumor simulates a true neoplasm both clinically and morphologically and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Our case and a review of the literature indicate that an effort should be made to perform a radical excision. This is considered the treatment of choice except if it requires a mutilating procedure. 
Late-infantile type galactosialidosis. Histopathology of the retina and optic nerve. We studied histopathologic findings from the retina and optic nerve of a patient with the late-infantile type of galactosialidosis and related them to clinical features of the condition. Markedly fewer ganglion cells were evident histopathologically using light microscopy. Results of histochemical studies demonstrated abnormal accumulation of lipid and proteinaceous material in the residual swollen ganglion cells. Marked loss of myelinated nerve fibers and thickening of the pial septum were also observed in the optic nerve. Both retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells had intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, but none were found in the optic nerve. These findings suggested that optic atrophy was induced by axonal wallerian degeneration secondary to retinal ganglion cell death. Although the fundus showed advanced optic nerve atrophy, a cherry red spot was not evident, possibly because of the marked decrease in ganglion cells in this case. 
Primary surgical treatment for carcinoma of the larynx: influence of the local invasion. In the period from 1976 to 1988, 417 patients with supraglottic carcinoma of the larynx were treated by primary surgery. Infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space was found in 11.99 per cent (50/417) of the patients. Carcinomas of the infrahyoid epiglottis spread to this space more frequently--14.24 per cent (44/309), than those of suprahyoid localization--5.55 per cent (6/108). Tumour invasion of the pre-epiglottic space is a relative contra-indication for reconstructive surgery. Partial conservation operations were performed on 32 per cent (16/50) of patients with invasion of the pre-epiglottic space. The remaining patients had a total laryngectomy. Infiltration of the paraglottic space intra-operatively was found in 2.4 per cent (10/417) of patients and all of these tumours were from the infrahyoid localization. Spread of tumours to this site is an indication for radical surgery and laryngectomy was performed on 80 per cent (8/10) of patients. 
The effect of prostaglandin E1 on acute pulmonary artery hypertension during oleic acid-induced respiratory dysfunction. This study examined the general effect of intravenous PGE1 on RV Ees and effective PA elastance (EA) during acute pulmonary hypertension associated with oleic acid infusion. In eight pigs, RV end-systolic elastance was quantified with the Ees and Ea was defined with reference to the Windkessel model. Oleic acid infusion increased mean PAP and Ea. Prostaglandin E1 reduced PAP and decreased Ea. Ees did not change throughout the study. Mean arterial pressure was reduced and the pulmonary shunt was increased after PGE1 infusion. The PaO2 was reduced. Data from this study suggest that although PGE1 is effective in reducing PAP, it is not as effective in reducing RV afterload. Furthermore, PGE1 does have significant side effects such as reduction of systemic arterial pressure and an increase in pulmonary shunt. 
Alpha 1 blockers. Safe, effective treatment for hypertension. Alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agents, used alone or in combination with other medications, are efficacious in the management of hypertension. They are safe and well tolerated, and they offer unique advantages. Their mechanism of action in lowering blood pressure targets elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which is the principal hemodynamic abnormality of essential hypertension. The alpha 1 blockers maintain cardiac output and blood flow to vital organs, and they do not affect renin release. These agents have beneficial lipid and metabolic effects and can improve left ventricular hypertrophy, theoretically having a positive impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The only drug interaction identified with the alpha 1 blockers is an increased hypotensive effect when they are combined with other antihypertensive agents. A further advantage of the alpha 1 blockers is that, because of the widespread location of alpha 1 receptors, the agents offer potential benefit for a number of disease states, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. They also provide an especially useful antihypertensive choice for middle-aged and elderly patients. 
Peripheral neuropathy after chronic endoneurial ischemia. We have developed a method for producing chronic regional nerve ischemia in rats by creating proximal limb arteriovenous shunts. This procedure results in a 50 to 75% reduction in endoneurial blood flow within the distal sciatic nerve as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Nerve conduction velocities in sciatic nerves ipsilateral to the shunt fell by 25 to 30% within 2 weeks after creation of the shunt and did not recover for up to 10 months after the procedure. Morphological studies of the ischemic nerves showed structural abnormalities at nodes of Ranvier and mild axonal atrophy. Neither segmental demyelination nor axonal degeneration were evident. These results indicate that reduced endoneurial blood flow, insufficient to cause infarction, may result in measurable functional and morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves. 
Current status of imaging indeterminate renal masses. In 1986 Bosniak proposed a classification of cysts and cystic renal masses in an attempt to define precisely the radiologic findings for lesions not requiring further evaluation and for those that should be explored surgically in an attempt to salvage normal renal parenchyma. This classification has been extremely useful in expanding the number of patients treated conservatively. The following entities can be considered benign and require no further evaluation: the classic simple cyst (Bosniak category 1), a cyst with benign calcification (see Fig. 1A and B), a hyperdense cyst (see Fig. 2), and a cyst with thin (less than or equal to 1mm) septations (see Fig. 5A; Bosniak category 2). When any of the following features are present, further evaluation is warranted: aggressive calcifications (see Fig. 1C-E), abnormal density not fulfilling the criteria of a hyperdense cyst (see Figs. 3 and 4), or nodular septations (see Fig. 5B and C), or wall thickening (see Fig. 7; Bosniak) category 3). Small masses that cannot be characterized accurately also require further evaluation. Multiloculated masses(see Fig. 9) require surgery (Bosniak category 3). Most cases of multiple localized renal cysts can be distinguished from multiloculated masses and do not require surgery (see Fig. 10). Evaluation of cyst fluid by MR imaging has not been proved reliable in differentiating benign and malignant masses. MR imaging will become more useful when its spatial resolution equals that of CT. Masses that remain indeterminate after careful evaluation by ultrasonography and CT scanning can be evaluated additionally by angiography or cyst puncture. Management options for persistent enigmatic masses include follow-up radiologic studies, exploration, local excision, and nephrectomy. 
Stapled ileoanal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis without a temporary diverting ileostomy. Between March 1989 and August 1990, we performed 21 stapled J pouch ileonal procedures (20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 1 familial polyposis [FP]) without an ileostomy in 19, of whom 13 were taking prednisone and eight underwent semi-emergent surgery for uncontrollable bleeding. During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function were compared to 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an S pouch, for a total of 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with pouch emptying. The S pouch had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0.02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0.05) night-time accidents (22% versus 68%), daytime (17% versus 55%) or night-time (28 versus 61%) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11% versus 42%) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1.8 +/- 1.3 cm (range, 0 to 3.5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12%) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease. It provides significantly better stool control and may obviate the need for an ileostomy with its complications. 
Determination of the extent of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease with color-assisted duplex sonography: comparison with angiography. Color-assisted duplex sonography combines color Doppler flow imaging with duplex sonography to rapidly survey the vasculature. Color Doppler sonography displays the motion of flowing blood on a sonogram and is used to visualize directly arterial lumen narrowing of greater than 50%. Absence of Doppler signals signifies arterial occlusion. Preangiographic triage of patients for surgical or interventional therapy requires that a rapid and accurate survey be performed of the extent of arterial disease. Color-assisted duplex sonography was applied prospectively in 17 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease who had not previously undergone angiography. Results of angiography of the femoropopliteal arteries were graded and localized in one of seven approximately equal arterial segments. These were compared with similar segmental maps made with sonography. For the detection of stenosis or occlusion in any of the 238 segments, the sensitivity was 0.88 (49/56), specificity 0.95 (173/182), and accuracy 0.93 (222/238). The average time taken to survey both limbs was 29 min. We conclude that color-assisted duplex sonography is an accurate and rapid tool for the noninvasive mapping of the extent of femoropopliteal arterial disease. 
Surgically induced cytokinetic responses in experimental rat mammary tumor models. The effect of surgical removal of "primary" tumors on the cytokinetics of local tumor remnants, secondary implants, and metastases was investigated in three different rat tumor models in the Wag/Rij rat: a slow-growing (MCR83) and a fast-growing (EMR86) hormone-dependent mammary tumor and a rapidly, but autonomously growing carcinoma (MCR86). The latter two tumors had metastatic potential. Cell kinetic studies were done using in vivo labeling with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Thirty-three hours after removal of a subcutaneous MCR83 flank tumor, secondary implants showed a significant (P less than 0.05) but transient increase in the BrdUrd labeling index (LI). A more rapid and prolonged increase, lasting for at least 7 days, was observed in EMR86 lymph node and lung metastases. In both models, no effect was observed after sham surgery (consisting of opening and closing of the skin under anesthesia). Removal of MCR86 tumors (growing in the hind leg muscle) also resulted in a rapid, transient LI increase in metastases. Continuous BrdUrd labeling experiments in this tumor model did not favor the hypothesis that the LI increase predominantly resulted from an increase in the growth fraction. Moreover, in this model, the effect was related to operation trauma. A similar increase in LI, although smaller than after tumor removal, was seen after major surgical trauma in MCR83 flank tumors. These results indicate that in the rat, tumor removal and/or major surgical trauma may modulate the cytokinetics of distant metastases significantly. A study of the systemic, possibly endocrine, factors involved in the growth-stimulating effect of surgical trauma in these rat tumor models may help to assess the clinical relevance of these findings for patients with breast cancer. 
Patterns of venous insufficiency in patients with varicose veins. The nature and distribution of venous disease surrounding the development of varicose veins and its treatment is controversial. Using duplex ultrasonography, we evaluated 54 lower extremities in 32 patients with varicose veins who were symptomatic and had obvious varicose veins by clinical examination. Twenty-eight percent had greater saphenous trunk incompetence, 2% had lesser saphenous trunk incompetence, and 96% had branch disease. Deep valvular incompetence was seen in 41%, saphenofemoral junction incompetence in 46%, and incompetence of one or more perforators in 46% of the extremities. Thirty-three percent demonstrated no evidence of associated saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, or perforating vein incompetence, while 20% had concurrent saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, and perforating vein incompetence. These data support the heterogeneity of venous disease seen in patients with varicose veins and suggest that surgical therapy be directed to a patient's specific pattern of incompetence rather than routine saphenofemoral junction ligation or stripping of the greater saphenous trunk. 
Narrow duct segment distal to choledochal cyst. "Narrow segments" (or stenotic portions) of the common bile duct (CBD) distal to cysts in two patients (a 50-yr-old woman and a 25-yr-old man) with choledochal cyst (CholCyst) were studied macroscopically and histologically. The narrow segments of the ducts were patent and connected with the main pancreatic duct extraduodenally, whereas the CBD in controls were neither dilated nor stenotic, and joined the main pancreatic duct within the duodenal wall. These narrow segments were 1 cm long. In case 1, a minute orifice was found in the narrow segment of the duct macroscopically and was identified microscopically as a small duct from a pancreatic lobule. In case 2, a small pancreatic duct also joined the narrow segment of the duct. These small pancreatic ducts were derived from the ventral pancreas, based on distribution of PP-islets. Therefore, the narrow duct distal to the cyst in patients with CholCyst (or congenital biliary dilatation) was considered to be a branch of the ventral pancreatic duct. 
Retinal migraine, chorea, and retinal artery thrombosis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report the case of a patient with the unusual combination of migraine, chorea, and retinal arterial thrombosis along with laboratory evidence of autoimmunity. In the absence of systemic lupus erythematosus, the clinical manifestations suggest the presence of the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 
Clinical use of biologic response modifiers in cancer treatment: an overview. Part II. Colony-stimulating factors and interleukin-2. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are hematopoietic growth hormones that stimulate the production, maturation, and function of white blood cells. The best studied are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), both of which can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Clinical indications for these agents include bone marrow failure secondary to administration of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation, bone marrow transplantation, and a variety of congenital or iatrogenic neutropenias. Toxicity in usual clinical doses is mild, and consists mainly of bone pain and constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a lymphokine that stimulates that multiplication of several types of killer cells. These cells can recognize and destroy foreign substances, such as tumors, without destroying normal cells. Major applications of IL-2 include treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, in whom the overall objective response rate is 15-30 percent, and malignant melanoma with response rates of about 18 percent. Combination therapy with other biologics and conventional cytotoxic drugs may increase IL-2's efficacy against these tumors. Toxicity is generally severe, but reversible. Hemodynamic toxicity, consisting of hypotension, edema, weight gain, and decreased renal function, is most characteristic. Suggestions are given for pharmacologic management of these and other IL-2 toxicities. 
Magnetic resonance imaging shows specific abnormalities in the MELAS syndrome. The MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) can be difficult to identify. We report MRI abnormalities that we believe are specific to this disorder in three patients with complete or partial MELAS syndrome. The patients all showed an unusual pattern on T2-weighted MRI with multifocal areas of hyperintense signal confined to the cortex of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and adjacent white matter. Some images suggested selective cortical involvement of deeper layers only. Deep white matter was relatively spared, distinguishing this from usual cerebrovascular disease or the edema after status epilepticus. Specificity of these findings is further suggested by a good correlation of these findings with the previously described unique postmortem brain pathology of MELAS. 
Electroencephalographic study of rat hyperthermic seizures. The behavior and EEG of rat hyperthermic convulsions was studied. We found that a long run of high-voltage slow waves without convulsions, high-voltage irregular activity consisting of spikes and waves with intermittent myoclonus, and rapid spike and wave bursts accompanied by generalized clonic convulsions occurred sequentially. This behavioral and EEG activity is analogous to human febrile convulsions and supports the usefulness of this model for studies of human febrile convulsions. Rats frequently showed arrest of locomotion concurrently with paroxysmal EEG theta bursts before development of generalized convulsions. We speculate that this paroxysmal activity is a type of seizure discharge. 
Long-term prognosis after partial gastrectomy for benign conditions. Survival and smoking-related death of 2633 Amsterdam postgastrectomy patients followed up since surgery between 1931 and 1960. Decreased life expectancy may occur after remote peptic ulcer surgery, but the cause of shortened survival is unclear. A 50-year follow-up study of an Amsterdam cohort of postgastrectomy patients who underwent ulcer surgery between 1931 and 1960 showed a statistically significant decrease in survival after a postoperative interval of 12 years or more compared with the general population. The shortened life expectancy mainly reflected decreased survival in men. In women, no significant difference in survival compared with the general population was observed. The excess mortality in men was predominantly due to a statistically significant increase in cancer-related deaths. Carcinoma of the lung accounted for the majority of excess mortality. No time relationship between lung cancer death and interval since surgery was observed. Thus, smoking, primarily in men who had undergone surgery for gastric ulcers, seems an important factor contributing to excess mortality and shortened life expectancy. Excess mortality due to tobacco use has also been observed in postmarketing surveillance of H2-receptor antagonists. Therefore, smoking cessation may provide the greatest improvement in the long-term prognosis of peptic ulcer patients, regardless of the treatment. 
Nonpalpable invasive breast cancer. The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989. Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found. One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions. Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report. Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases. Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86). Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions. Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes. Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes. Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes. Nodal status is unknown for eight patients. Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes. Median follow-up is 44 months. Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients). Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients. For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients). These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography. 
Screening for cervical cancer by direct inspection. Since cytology-based screening programmes for cervical cancer cannot be provided on a large scale in developing countries, an alternative approach is needed. To find out whether visual inspection of the cervix is an adequate alternative, women with cytological evidence of dysplasia were followed up cytologically and colposcopically until cancer was detected, and the gross appearance of the cervix was recorded at each stage. Although only 40-50% of cancers were accompanied by abnormal-looking cervices, whereas 71% were detectable on cytology and 87% on colposcopy, visual inspection may be useful in areas where cytological screening programmes are not available. 
Mouse platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene is deleted in W19H and patch mutations on chromosome 5. The mouse W19H mutation is an x-ray-induced deletion of more than 2 centimorgans on chromosome 5 encompassing the white spotting mutation W (encoded by the Kit protooncogene), patch (Ph), and recessive lethal (l) loci. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA) like Kit encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. By using mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and haplotype analysis in interspecific backcross mice, mouse Pdgfra was mapped to chromosome 5 in tight linkage with Kit. Hybridization of a PDGFRA probe to DNAs from W19H/ + heterozygous mice and patch heterozygous mice, and their wild-type littermates, demonstrated deletion of Pdgfra. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that Kit and Pdgfra are linked on a 630-kilobase Mlu I DNA fragment. Thus the W19H deletion removes at least two receptor tyrosine kinases and the results suggest Pdgfra as a candidate for the Ph locus. 
Clues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. 
Allergic rash due to antiepileptic drugs: clinical features and management. Optimal management of allergic rash from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is unclear. We identified 50 patients with 68 reactions (36 to one AED, 10 to two AEDs, and four to three AEDs). The AEDs implicated were carbamazepine, 30; phenobarbital (PB), 20; phenytoin, 16; ethosuximide, one; and AED combination, one. Sixty-three reactions were cutaneous eruptions, three exfoliative dermatitis, and two Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Forty-six reactions were mild (rash only), 18 moderate (systemic symptoms or other organ system involvement), and four life-threatening (all with PB). In most patients with greater than 1 reaction, the second and third reactions were not more severe than the first. Prior antibiotic allergies or nonmedication allergies were no more common than in a control group without reactions. The AED was ceased abruptly in 59 patients (22 of whom did not receive a new AED), tapered in five, and continued unchanged in four. Despite this, there was no status epilepticus (SE) during the reaction or its treatment, and no patient's seizure control deteriorated. In 40 cases, a new AED was added--16 after the reaction had resolved and 24 before total resolution. Rash recurred with the new AED in 50 and 42% respectively (NS). We conclude that, though allergic rashes to AEDs are usually mild, the rare occurrence of severe reactions indicates that the AED should be ceased. This can be done abruptly with minimal risk of SE. A new AED can be added, if necessary, prior to the resolution of the rash without increasing the risk of further reactions. 
Morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Three-hundred forty-one HBsAg-positive family members of 152 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (47 asymptomatic carriers, 59 with chronic hepatitis, 17 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were prospectively studied to determine the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither hepatocellular carcinoma in the index patient nor a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma in the family was associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HBsAg-positive family members. 
Correlation of the optic disc size to glaucoma susceptibility. Previous studies have suggested that a larger optic disc size in blacks as compared with whites is related to the increased glaucoma susceptibility in blacks. In an intraindividual bilateral comparison of 245 white patients with open-angle glaucoma, the authors evaluated whether the glaucomatous optic nerve damage was greater or less in the eye with the larger optic nerve head. Highly myopic eyes were excluded. The difference in optic disc area of one eye as compared with the contralateral eye was not significantly correlated to the differences in visibility of retinal nerve fiber bundles and mean visual field defect between the two eyes. Mean perimetric loss and the retinal nerve fiber layer index were not significantly higher in the eye with the larger or smaller optic nerve head. This indicates that in whites, high myopes excluded, the susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve fiber loss may be independent of the optic disc size. 
Actuarial analysis of the occurrence of remissions following thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in 400 patients. The role of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) was analysed in 400 patients affected with generalised MG operated on between 1974-83, and prospectively followed up for five years after surgery. The occurrence of stable remission (SR) (that is, complete clinical drug-free remission that remains stable for all the subsequent follow up) was the endpoint of survival analyses and the distribution of SR time (SRT, that is, the interval from thymectomy to the occurrence of SR) was assessed by actuarial and Cox multivariate analyses. SRT distribution after surgery showed a slow progressive increase of cumulative SR rate that could both be ascribed to a delayed effect of thymectomy as well as reflect the natural history of MG, itself characterised by an increasing probability of spontaneous remission with time. SRT distribution was similar after stratification for all variables studied except when patients without thymoma were stratified for the need for immunosuppressive treatment in addition to thymectomy. Patients without thymoma who did not require additional immunosuppressive therapy (n = 130) had the highest SR rate occurring in the two years after thymectomy, and differed from patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs who showed the highest SR rate five years after surgery. Actuarial analysis has therefore identified a subgroup of patients where SR, occurring in the first years after surgery, is more likely to be ascribed to thymectomy than merely reflect the natural course of the disease. 
Noninfectious colitis associated with short gut syndrome in infants. We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month period. The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino acid-containing formula. Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema, patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without ulcerations or pseudomembranes. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings. 
Squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal: management with combined chemo-radiation therapy. Twenty patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal received combined chemo-radiation therapy as their primary treatment. There were 18 women and two men with a mean age of 63 years (range, 34-91 years). The mean follow-up was 34 months (range, 6-62 months). Anal margin cancers and adenocarcinomas were excluded. Fourteen of 20 patients treated had a complete response. There were six local failures: three with residual disease at the end of treatment and three with recurrent disease at a later date. Of the three with residual disease, one underwent abdominoperineal resection and two received salvage therapy (one with chemo-radiation and one with radiation alone). All three patients with recurrent disease were treated with abdominoperineal resection. All six were disease free at the end of the study. Of the 14 patients with complete local response, one presented with liver metastases 19 months later. Sixteen patients (80 percent) were alive at the end of the study, and 19 patients (95 percent) had no evidence of disease. These data add support for salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with residual disease following initial chemo-radiation therapy. Salvage options for patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus who fail the Nigro protocol will be discussed. 
Comparison of dexamethasone and ondansetron in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial was done to compare the efficacy and safety of a serotonin receptor antagonist--ondansetron--and dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis and nausea induced by moderately emetogenic non-platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation. 
Pediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. 
Evaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. 
Surgical cure of cardiac arrhythmia. 1969. The first surgical procedure undertaken for the intended purpose of curing a patient with recurrent tachycardia was performed by Sealy in 1968, and the report of that operation was published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery in 1969. The first attempted accessory bundle ablation was successful, marked the beginning of cardiac arrhythmia surgery, and has set the standard against which other methods of arrhythmia control must be measured. 
Relationship of temperature pattern and serious bacterial infections in infants 4 to 8 weeks old 24 to 48 hours after antibiotic treatment. STUDY OBJECTIVE: A new management approach to selected febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old evaluated for possible sepsis is outpatient ceftriaxone therapy, with subsequent re-evaluation 24 to 48 hours after presentation. This study assessed whether the temperature profile of such infants during the 24- to 48-hour period after treatment distinguished those with from those without serious bacterial infections (SBIs). DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old. SETTING: An urban pediatric emergency department and hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All infants underwent a sepsis evaluation (lumbar puncture, CBC/blood culture, and urinalysis/urine culture) and were hospitalized for at least 48 hours. Temperatures were measured on presentation and then every four hours during hospitalization. All infants received parenteral third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic therapy, and none received antipyretic medication unless fever was documented. Fever (rectal temperature of more than 38.0 C) was documented during the 24- to 48-hour period after presentation in 28 infants (17.6%)--one of a total of 18 infants (5.6%) with SBI and 27 of a total of 143 infants (19%) without SBI (alpha, more than .2: power .30). All bacterial isolates in cases of SBI were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics. All repeat blood and urine cultures that were performed in infants with bacteremia or urinary tract infections, respectively, were negative 24 hours after presentation. CONCLUSION: Infants 4 to 8 weeks old who remain febrile during the 24 to 48-hour period after presentation and initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy are less likely to have SBI. This study did not have sufficient power for this difference to be statistically significant. 
Tolerance to somatostatin analogue in a preterm infant with islet cell dysregulation syndrome. An infant of 31 weeks' gestation presented with refractory neonatal hypoglycaemia secondary to islet cell dysregulation. Treatment was started with somatostatin analogue and his glycaemic control improved initially. Tolerance developed, however, in that the dose required to maintain control increased by a factor of 40. The infant subsequently underwent pancreatectomy. It is safe to use somatostatin analogue in a preterm infant, but tolerance to the drug rapidly develops. 
Assessing the feasibility of bronchoplastic surgery with magnetic resonance imaging. Bronchoplastic surgical techniques may allow resectional therapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma in select patients in whom preoperative pulmonary function demonstrates prohibitive risk for pneumonectomy. We report an otherwise poor candidate for pneumonectomy in whom coronal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the potential for distal bronchial salvage. 
The evaluation of coronary bypass graft patency: direct and indirect techniques other than coronary arteriography. Patients having one or more coronary artery bypass graft operations constitute an important part of the practice of cardiac radiology. Bypass graft patency can be determined by indirect and direct methods. The indirect imaging methods include radionuclide ventriculography, thallium-201 scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography. The direct methods include conventional CT, ultrafast CT, MR imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and Doppler sonography. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of these methods and attempts to define the relative importance of each of these techniques in the evaluation of bypass graft patency. 
123I-iodoamphetamine SPECT brain imaging in alternating hemiplegia. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an unusual disorder characterized by early onset (occurring before 18 months of age); repeated attacks of hemiplegia involving both sides of the body; other paroxysmal phenomena, such as tonic stiffening, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances, in association with bouts of hemiplegia or occurring independently; and evidence of mental or neurologic deficits. A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months. The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age. They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis. They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal. Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere. Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated. The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased. The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
Prevalence of risk factors in men with premature coronary artery disease. The prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl) was determined in 321 men less than 60 years of age (mean +/- standard deviation 50 +/- 7) with premature coronary artery disease (CAD) documented at coronary angiography. The prevalence of these risk factors was markedly different than in the Framingham Offspring Study population, used here as a comparison group. In the patients with CAD, only 3% had no risk factor (other than male sex), compared with 31% in the Framingham Offspring Study subjects. Most patients with CAD (97%) had greater than or equal to 1 additional risk factor. When the patients with CAD were divided by age groups (40 to 49 years [n = 109], 50 to 59 [n = 191]), no significant differences were observed in the prevalence of risk factors between the young and older patients. The prevalence of systemic hypertension (41 vs 19%, p less than 0.001), diabetes mellitus (12 vs 1.1%, p less than 0.001), cigarette smoking (67 vs 28%, p less than 0.001) and HDL cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl (63 vs 19%, p less than 0.001) was markedly higher in the patients with CAD than in Framingham Offspring Study subjects, whereas the prevalence of LDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl was not significantly different between patients with CAD and Framingham Offspring Study subjects (26 vs 26%). 
Reduced postoperative hospitalization after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An initial experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 consecutive patients was reviewed and the results compared with those of a group of 25 patients who underwent laparotomy cholecystectomy during the 3 months before the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 44 of 50 consecutive patients in whom it was attempted. When compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy cholecystectomy was associated with longer mean (s.d.) anaesthesia, 155 (61) min versus 102 (31) min (P less than 0.001), shorter mean postoperative hospital stay, 3.5 (1.5) versus 8.8 (3.2) days (P less than 0.001), and reduced mean cost, pounds 895 (376) versus pounds 2210 (822) (P less than 0.001). Perioperative morbidity was also reduced following laparoscopy cholecystectomy (9 per cent versus 16 per cent) but not significantly so. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, effective procedure which completely removes the gallbladder. It significantly reduces hospital stay, is cosmetically satisfactory and has financial benefits. We suggest that this technique be considered for all patients having cholecystectomy. 
The scimitar syndrome. The clinical spectrum of the scimitar syndrome ranges from severely ill infants to asymptomatic adults. The true incidence of the disorder is unknown because the syndrome may remain undetected in asymptomatic patients until a chest roentgenogram is obtained. We have presented the contrasting clinical experiences of two adult women, one with few symptoms and a benign course, and the other with exacerbation of her asthma from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections originating in the lower lobe of her right lung. Improvement resulted from surgical resection of this congenitally abnormal, bronchiectatic segment of lung. 
Use of modified diets in nursing homes. Randomly chosen medical charts of 212 elderly subjects in 11 nursing homes were reviewed to determine which characteristics of the subjects were most closely associated with their diet prescriptions. The chart reviews indicated that 104 (49.0%) of the 212 subjects had some type of nutrient-modified diet prescription. Eight patients who were tube fed were not included in subsequent analyses. Sodium restriction was the most common modification (60 [29.4%] of the remaining 204 patients) and calorie-controlled diets were also common (52 [25.5%] of the patients). Of the 55 patients with hypertension, 31 (56.4%) had no sodium restriction. Only 10% of all low-sodium diets limited sodium to 2 g per day. Of the 38 patients with diabetes, 7 (18.4%) had no prescription for calorie control, and there was no indication that increased dietary fiber was encouraged for diabetic patients. Only one of the 121 subjects with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or atherosclerosis had a prescription for a cholesterol-lowering diet. Characteristics of the subjects not specifically related to diet or diagnosis, such as age, sex, duration of stay, and level of care, had no significant relationship to diet prescription. These findings suggest that the practitioners in our sample were not convinced of the efficacy of modified diets to control disease for most nursing home residents. 
Cationic Yersinia antigen-induced chronic allergic arthritis in rats. A model for reactive arthritis in humans. Cationic antigens are known to have considerable arthritogenic potential in experimental systems. During a systematic search for suitable, naturally occurring candidates an intracellular protein was isolated from the ribosomal pellet of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3, a bacterial strain associated with reactive arthritis in humans. The protein is highly cationic, contains two 19-kD polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, and reveals a strong tendency for spontaneous aggregation. It is suggested to be a nucleic acid binding protein. We tested this antigen for its ability to induce arthritis after intra-articular challenge in preimmunized rats. An acute inflammatory phase followed by transition to chronicity was observed both by technetium-99m scintigraphy and from histology. Massive polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the synovium was seen early on and fibrosis and thickening of the joint capsule occurred in later stages. Control groups showed no evidence of inflammation. Western blot and ELISA analysis of unselected sera from Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3-infected patients revealed antibodies to the antigen in the majority of cases, whereas healthy individuals rarely reacted. This is the first report of a naturally occurring cationic antigen capable of inducing immunologic tissue injury; it justifies the speculation that cationic antigens from prokaryotic cells could trigger reactive arthritis in humans. 
The epidemiology of breast cancer. Table 5 presents risk factors for breast cancer generally regarded as established, together with their approximate relative risks. With the exception of age, country of birth, and a history of breast cancer in both a mother and a sister, all of the relative risks reported to date are of a relatively modest magnitude. Thus, new risk factors need to be identified and knowledge of existing risk factors refined. Factors for which the evidence of an etiologic role has mounted over the past several years, but which are not yet considered to be established, include the protective effects of parity and lactation in certain age groups and the increased risks associated with alcohol consumption and with DES exposure during pregnancy. In addition, physical activity has emerged as a factor worthy of further study. Some evidence suggests that use of oral contraceptives for several years at an early age modestly increases the risk for breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 and perhaps age 45. Use of estrogen-replacement therapy for 20 years or more has been found by a few studies to increase the risk for breast cancer in the postmenopausal years; further studies of very long-term users are needed. Also, other risks and benefits of these hormones need to be taken into account when women decide whether to use them. Surprisingly elusive has been the etiologic role of endogenous hormones, especially in view of the large number of studies that have been concerned with them. A better understanding of the role of endogenous hormones should help explain the mechanisms of action of known and suspected risk factors. Areas of high priority for further research thus include establishing with more certainty whether the risk for breast cancer is increased in any subgroups of women who use oral contraceptives and estrogen-replacement therapy and determining the etiologic roles of specific endogenous hormones. The possible risks associated with alcohol consumption and lack of physical activity need to be studied more thoroughly, and ideas about new potential risk factors are needed. Although epidemiologic studies will continue to be concerned with diet, enthusiasm for its etiologic role in women has been considerably dampened by the lack of association in many of the studies reported to date. The studies in women exposed to radiation, DES, and oral contraceptives suggest that the timing of some exposures may be critical, since the effects of these agents may mostly be limited to specific time periods of rapid breast development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Effect of massive dose vitamin A on morbidity and mortality in Indian children The effect of vitamin A supplementation on preschool child morbidity and mortality was assessed in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study around Hyderabad, India. Every six months 200,000 IU vitamin A was given to 7691 children (treatment group) whereas 8084 children received a placebo (control group). Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months. Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes. Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo. The findings suggest that vitamin A supplementation alone may not reduce child mortality. 
Full-field electroretinograms in patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome. We examined five patients who had carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome with full-field electroretinograms. Only two of the patients showed fundus changes typical for retinitis pigmentosa, whereas abnormal electroretinograms were seen in all patients. There was no recordable rod response; however, a delay in the cone b-wave implicit time was noted. All patients had nyctalopia. These observations suggest that patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome have a progressive tapetoretinal degenerative disorder of the retinitis pigmentosa type with defined alterations in the electroretinogram. 
Early coronary reperfusion blunts the procoagulant response of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and von Willebrand factor in acute myocardial infarction. The effects of early coronary recanalization on the plasma levels of two procoagulant acute phase proteins, the fastacting plasminogen activator inhibitor and von Willebrand factor, were investigated in 24 patients with myocardial infarction receiving intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 6 h of the onset of symptoms. Coronary angiography was performed before and 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings and 4 h plasma creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK MB) were performed over the first 24 h. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, von Willebrand factor and C-reactive protein were measured before rt-PA infusion, daily for the first 3 days and after 90 days. In the entire group, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity peaked at 24 h (day 1), representing a significant increase over values at all other times (p = 0.03). von Willebrand factor was higher in the first 2 days of infarction compared with after 90 days (p = 0.001). C-reactive protein peaked on day 2, with an eightfold increase over values on admission (p = 0.001). In the 16 patients with a patent infarct-related artery at 90 min, infarct size estimated by integrated 24 h CK MB, time for ST segment elevation to decrease to half-maximum and peak C-reactive protein were reduced significantly by more than twofold compared with values in the 8 patients with an occluded artery at 90 min. The patients with early recanalization also had lower plasminogen activator inhibitor activity on day 2 (p = 0.05) and day 3 (p = 0.02) and lower 0 to 72 h averaged von Willebrand factor (p = 0.01). Thus, early coronary recanalization curtails the response of plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and von Willebrand factor to myocardial infarction, most likely by reducing the extent of ischemia and necrosis and the consequent acute phase reaction. By blunting the early postinfarction procoagulant state, prompt recanalization may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications in the first days after myocardial infarction. 
Prediction of outcome after mitral valve replacement in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The importance of left atrial size. BACKGROUND. The ability to predict outcome after mitral valve replacement remains limited in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The aims of this study were to determine the preoperative predictors of postoperative cardiac-related mortality and to assess the additive prognostic value of tests performed in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Accordingly, 176 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 14 years) who underwent mitral valve replacement were followed up for 3.8 +/- 0.5 years. Four categories of variables were analyzed to predict postoperative cardiac-related mortality: clinical, laboratory, two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE), and cardiac catheterization. There were 39 cardiac-related deaths (29 due to congestive heart failure and 10 sudden). When the four categories were analyzed separately, two clinical, one laboratory, two 2DE, and one catheterization variable best predicted postoperative death. When these six variables were examined simultaneously, only three (one clinical and two 2DE) remained significant predictors of cardiac-related mortality: presence of pulmonary rales, left atrial size, and the ratio of left ventricular wall thickness to left ventricular cavity dimension in end systole. A model based on these three variables may predict cardiac-related death with considerable accuracy. Laboratory data did not add to clinical information for predicting death. 2DE variables provided significant additional information in this regard (p less than 0.001). Further addition of catheterization variables was not useful. Prognostic value did not change significantly when 50 patients with prior mitral valve surgery or 49 patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) measures of both left ventricular systolic function and left atrial size are equally important in predicting postoperative cardiac-related mortality in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve replacement; 2) left atrial size may be important because it reflects the "history" (severity and duration) of mitral regurgitation; 3) 2DE assessment of left atrial size and left ventricular function provides prognostic information that is significantly greater than that obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters alone; the addition of catheterization variables does not increase the prognostic value of the clinical and 2DE data. 
Vocal cord paralysis in the Shy-Drager syndrome. A cause of postoperative respiratory obstruction. A case is presented in which unexpected and persistent postoperative respiratory problems led to the finding of bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis and confirmed the diagnosis of the Shy-Drager syndrome. Anaesthetists should be aware that vocal cord paralysis may be a feature of this uncommon condition, and should consider the possibility of glottic obstruction as a cause of ventilatory difficulties. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
Ventilatory dysfunction precedes pulmonary vascular changes in monocrotaline-treated rats. Rats with established monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension also exhibit a profound increase in lung resistance (RL) and a decrease in lung compliance. Because airway/lung dysfunction could precede and influence the evolution of MCT-induced pulmonary vascular disease, it is important to establish the temporal relationship between development of pulmonary hypertension and altered ventilatory function in MCT-treated rats. To resolve this issue, we segregated 47 young Sprague-Dawley rats into four groups: control (n = 13), MCT1 (n = 9), MCT2 (n = 11), and MCT3 (n = 14). Each MCT rat received a single subcutaneous injection of MCT (60 mg/kg) 1 MCT1), 2 (MCT2), or 3 (MCT3) wk before the functional study. At 1 wk after MCT, significant increases in RL and alveolar wall thickness were observed, as was a significant decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). Medial thickness of pulmonary arteries (50-100 microns OD) and right ventricular hypertrophy were not observed until 2 and 3 wk post-MCT, respectively. Coincident with the right ventricular hypertrophy at 3 wk post-MCT were decreased DLCO and increased alveolar wall thickness and lung dry weight. Pressure-volume curves of air-filled and saline-filled lungs showed marked rightward shifts during the 1st and 2nd wk after MCT administration and then decreased at the 3rd wk. These data suggest that MCT-induced alterations in airway/lung function preceded those of pulmonary vasculature and, therefore, implicate airway/lung dysfunctions as potentially contributing to the later development of pulmonary vascular abnormalities. 
Effects of training on metabolic responses and performance capacity in Streptococcus pneumoniae infected rats. These experiments were designed to study whether endurance training prior to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in rats (N = 15 in each group) alters lethality, performance capacity, and related energy metabolism. A 5-d.wk-1, 4-wk-long pre-infection training program with gradually increasing swim time caused no protection from lethality (48% at 72 h post-inoculation), but performance capacity increased by 68% (P less than 0.01). The catabolic responses as evidenced by changes in insulin and glucagon levels were less pronounced. Mobilization of free fatty acids increased twofold (P less than 0.01), and improved ketonemic adaptation (47%, P less than 0.01) occurred with concomitant saved carcass, liver, and skeletal muscle glycogen contents (P less than 0.01). This shift from carbohydrate toward fat metabolism during exercise as a result of training was also reflected by 21% lower (P less than 0.01) blood lactate levels. It was concluded that the improved metabolic status, characterizing the trained as compared with the untrained host, is partly preserved during ongoing acute gram-positive bacterial infection. 
Monitoring of human cytomegalovirus infections and ganciclovir treatment in heart transplant recipients by determination of viremia, antigenemia, and DNAemia. Fourteen heart transplant recipients were monitored for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection based on determination of antigenemia, viremia, and DNAemia (by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Three patients had symptomatic primary, 10 had recurrent (3 asymptomatic), and 1 (seronegative) had no HCMV infection. Severe clinical symptoms appeared when levels of viremia/antigenemia were greater than 50 infected PMNL/2 x 10(5) cells examined. Of 200 blood samples examined, 93 (46.5%) were positive for viremia/antigenemia and DNAemia, whereas 48 (24.0%) were positive for DNAemia only; 59 (29.5%) were negative in all assays. Follow-up of HCMV infections in heart transplant recipients showed that PCR can detect viral appearance in blood 7-10 days earlier than assays for antigenemia/viremia. On the other hand, viral disappearance from blood, as assessed by PCR, occurred weeks or months later than revealed by other assays. Detection of virus by PCR only was never associated with overt HCMV-related clinical symptoms. Of the 8 symptomatic patients treated with ganiclovir, 2 became PCR-negative at the end of treatment and 1 cleared virus from blood in the following weeks, whereas 5 showed persistent or recurrent infection. 
The importance of adequate anticoagulation to prevent early thrombosis after stenting of stenosed venous bypass grafts. Stent implantation in native coronary arteries may be complicated by acute thrombosis, despite the use of stringent anticoagulation. Thrombotic occlusion of stented venous grafts may occur less frequently, possibly because of the larger caliber of these grafts. We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75). Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two. After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol. Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients. A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy. It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation. 
The value of MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA-125 for discrimination between metastatic breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA 125 were determined in the serum of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 38 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. 
Surgical risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is increasingly recognized as a cause of lobar cerebral hemorrhage in normotensive elderly individuals. Isolated reports have suggested that neurosurgical intervention entails a high risk of precipitated hemorrhage. We identified 16 pathologically confirmed cases of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fourteen of these patients presented with lobar cerebral hemorrhage. Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but we conclude that neurosurgical intervention, particularly evacuation of hematomas, is not associated with major risk of precipitated hemorrhage. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Gynecological malignancies, brain tumors, and familial adenomatous polyposis. The syndrome of familial adenomatous polyposis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including adenomatous polyps of the colon and small bowel, adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater, tumors of the central nervous system, bone lesions, and various soft tissue tumors. The one common denominator is colonic polyposis. It is not known whether this phenotypic heterogeneity is due to various genotypes, or if the entire clinical spectrum is due to one genetic defect. We are reporting the association of gynecologic malignancies with familial adenomatous polyposis as an additional variant of this disease. This report is on two sisters from a family with familial polyposis coli who developed adenomatous polyposis of the colon, central nervous system tumors, and cancers of the ovary and uterus. The gynecological malignancies add another variant to this clinical syndrome. 
Early experience with mitral valve reconstruction for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement. From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital. Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated. Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery. Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients. Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%). Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge. Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients. Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients. Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair. Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation. Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable. Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic. There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation. Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results. Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified. 
Idioventricular rhythm: hypervagotonia associated with placebo. We report a case of hypervagotonia manifested by idioventricular rhythm in a healthy, athletic man who participated in a Phase I study of an investigational calcium-channel blocker. Upon breaking the study's double-blind study code, it was discovered that the subject had received placebo. We discuss this unusual finding and the implications of including athletic subjects in safety/tolerance studies. 
Cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. Incidence and mortality from a community-wide perspective, 1975 to 1988 BACKGROUND. Cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction is a serious complication with a high mortality rate, but little is known about whether its incidence or outcome has changed over time. As part of an ongoing population-based study of acute myocardial infarction, we examined trends over time in the incidence and mortality rate of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. We studied 4762 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area between 1975 and 1988. We determined the incidence of and short-term and long-term mortality due to cardiogenic shock in each of six years during this study period. RESULTS. The incidence of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction remained relatively constant, averaging 7.5 percent. Multivariate regression analysis that controlled for variables affecting incidence revealed significant though inconsistent temporal trends in the incidence of cardiogenic shock. As compared with the risk in 1975, the adjusted relative risk (with 95 percent confidence interval) was 0.83 (0.54 to 1.28) in 1978, 0.96 (0.63 to 1.48) in 1981, 0.68 (0.42 to 1.12) in 1984, 1.16 (0.70 to 1.92) in 1986, and 1.65 (0.99 to 2.77) in 1988. The overall in-hospital mortality rate among patients with cardiogenic shock was significantly higher than that among patients without this complication (77.7 percent vs. 13.5 percent, P less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality among the patients with shock did not improve between 1975 (73.7 percent) and 1988 (81.7 percent). Long-term survival during the 14-year follow-up period was significantly worse among patients who survived cardiogenic shock during hospitalization than among patients who did not have shock (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this observational, community-wide study suggest that neither the incidence nor the prognosis of cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction has improved over time. Both in-hospital and long-term survival remain poor for patients with this complication. 
Preconditioning causes improved wall motion as well as smaller infarcts after transient coronary occlusion in rabbits. BACKGROUND. A brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in less myocardial infarction than the longer occlusion alone. However, the effects of this preconditioning on recovery of systolic function after coronary occlusion have not been determined. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ultrasonic crystals implanted in rabbit myocardium measured segment length in the distribution of a branch of the left coronary artery that was fitted with a snare occluder. Rabbits were randomly allocated to either nonpreconditioned or preconditioned groups. Rabbits in the latter group underwent preconditioning with a 5-minute coronary occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. Then the coronary artery was occluded for 20 minutes in all rabbits, after which it was allowed to reperfuse for 90 minutes. The hearts were then excised, and infarct size was measured by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. During coronary occlusion, all hearts except one demonstrated either akinesis or paradoxical bulging. Five minutes after release of the 20-minute occlusion, active shortening had returned in the preconditioned rabbits and averaged 27.9 +/- 16.6% of baseline shortening. At the same time, paradoxical lengthening persisted in nonpreconditioned rabbits (-15.5 +/- 19.8% of baseline). By the end of the 90-minute reperfusion period, segment shortening averaged 40.1 +/- 8.4% of baseline in preconditioned rabbits and only 6.2 +/- 12.0% in nonpreconditioned rabbits (p less than 0.05). Infarct size as a percentage of risk area was significantly smaller in preconditioned rabbits as well (3.0 +/- 1.6% versus 28.8 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.002) and likely accounted for the improved shortening. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in not only reduced infarct size but also significantly better recovery of systolic function. 
The use of immobilized protamine in removing heparin and preventing protamine-induced complications during extracorporeal blood circulation. Heparin, currently used in extracorporeal blood circulation procedures, may lead to hemorrhagic complications. Protamine, used for reversal of heparin-induced anticoagulation at the end of such procedures, can cause adverse hemodynamic responses. To prevent both types of complications, we have developed a reactor device containing immobilized protamine (i.e., a protamine bio-reactor) that can be placed at the distal end of the circuit, thus providing simultaneous extracorporeal heparin removal and protamine treatment. In preliminary in vivo studies involving dogs at a blood flow of 100 ml/min, the bio-reactor removed about 50% of the administered dose of heparin (i.e., 100 units/kg) in 10 min. While rapid injection of protamine in dogs anticoagulated with heparin produced a transient and significant (P less than 0.005) decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure (-39.5 +/- 9.2 mmHg), cardiac output (-1.59 +/- 0.23 L/min), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (-7.5 +/- 1.3%) and increases in pulmonary artery systolic (+12.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg) and diastolic pressures (+10.0 +/- 3.6 mmHg), the use of the protamine bio-reactor did not elicit any statistically significant change in any of the variables measured. Hemolysis was not significant, as reflected by a statistically insignificant change of the animals' red blood cell counts, hematocrits, and total hemoglobin values. In addition, hemolytic complement was found to be reduced only by 10% in animals with the protamine bio-reactor, whereas it was reduced rapidly by 20% in animals receiving intravenous protamine administration and progressively by 20% in control animals with a sham reactor that contained no protamine. Furthermore, the use of the protamine bio-reactor also significantly reduced the protamine-induced transient thrombocytopenic and granulocytopenic responses. The white blood cell counts and platelet counts decreased to 87.7 +/- 7.5 and 83.3 +/- 5.0% of baseline, respectively, in dogs with the protamine bio-reactor compared to 35.5 +/- 14.3 and 32.1 +/- 8.1% of baseline in dogs receiving intravenous protamine. The protamine bio-reactor may provide a unique means to simultaneously control both heparin- and protamine-induced complications. 
Molteno implantation for glaucoma in young patients. Seventy patients younger than 21 years of age underwent Molteno implantation for nonneovascular glaucoma. Fifty-three (76%) patients had failed angle and/or conventional filtering surgery. Final intraocular pressure less than 22 mmHg (but over 5 mmHg) was achieved in 40 (62%) of the 65 patients with at least 6-month follow-up (range, 6 to 59 months; mean +/- standard deviation, 22.7 +/- 14.1 months); however, only 22 (34%) were controlled after the initial Molteno implantation procedure, and 54 (83%) patients underwent further glaucoma and/or nonglaucoma surgical procedures. The visual acuities remained within one line of their preoperative levels or improved in 25 (68%) of the 37 patients on whom Snellen acuities were available. The most frequent complications included: tube-cornea touch (20%, transient in 3%), corneal edema (17%), retinal detachment (16%), tube block (10%), cataract (9%), chronic hypotony or phthisis (9%), pupillary or cyclitic membrane (9%), hyphema (7%), flat anterior chamber (6%), and large postoperative choroidal effusion (6%). Despite the high rates of subsequent surgical interventions and complications, Molteno implantation has been a useful approach for achieving intraocular pressure reduction in young patients with glucoma. 
Relation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: a case-control study. We conducted a case-control study in five general hospitals in the region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (peptic oesophagitis, gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20). 
Dietary protein restriction stress and adrenocortical function: evidence for transient and long-term induction of enhanced cellular function. Previous work has demonstrated that 4-week protein restriction of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) increases both adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH and corticosteroidogenic capacity. In the present study we examined the transience (study 1) and the persistence (study 2) of this effect of protein restriction. In study 1, two strains of domestic fowl were used: a slower-growing White Leghorn strain and a faster-growing Cobb broiler strain. Cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric diets containing either low (L; 5% or 8%) or control (C; 20%) levels of soy protein for 2 weeks, and then were either switched to the alternate diet (C-L, L-C) or maintained on the initial diet (C-C, L-L) for an additional 2 weeks. Cockerels were killed at 6 weeks of age. In study 2, White Leghorn cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed either diet for 4 weeks and then switched to or maintained on the control diet for an additional 4 weeks (i.e. C vs. restriction followed by repletion). In this study cockerels were killed at 10 weeks of age. In both studies highly enriched populations of adrenocortical cells were isolated from cockerel adrenal glands, and their steroidogenic properties (basal and maximally induced corticosterone and cAMP production; steroidogenic agent ED50 values) were evaluated in 2-h suspension incubations. In study 1, regardless of strain, the greater the length of the restriction period, the greater the magnitude of maximal cellular corticosterone production induced by ACTH; the average value for 4-week restriction (L-L) was 39.5% greater than that for 2-week restriction (L-C, C-L) and 117.5% greater than that for control (C-C). In addition, the value for restriction from 4-6 weeks of age (C-L) was 34% greater than that for restriction from 2-4 weeks of age (L-C), suggesting that the enhancement of maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production after a 2-week restriction interval might be transient. Although there were no strain differences in the effect of protein restriction on maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production, there were strain differences in its effect on cellular sensitivity to ACTH, as indicated by the ACTH ED50 values (the lower the ED50 value, the greater tha cellular sensitivity). With the White Leghorn strain, the greater the duration of protein restriction, the greater the adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH; the sensitivity of L-L cells was 3.0 times the sensitivities of L-C and C-L cells and 4.1 times the sensitivity of C-C cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Asperger's syndrome: who is being abused? Six case histories of children referred and admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit at a tertiary referral centre because of concerns about poor functioning and possible emotional abuse are presented. On initial assessment the children appeared to be well functioning and the impression was confirmed that their emotional needs were not being met by their parents. After detailed inpatient appraisal the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made in all six cases, exemplified mainly by a formal concrete way of thinking and an inability to identify and understand human emotions and relationships. The impact of the diagnosis on the parents and their consequent relationships with their child and their willingness to work with professionals is discussed. 
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and early mortality. To assess morbidity, mortality, and benefit associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG), we retrospectively studied 42 patients who had had PEG. Mortality was exceptionally high during the first 60 days after PEG (43%), and then stabilized. In nearly half of the cases (20/42) the PEG tube was removed during the first 60 days because of either death or improvement. Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure. 
Localization of receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in pancreatic and mammary cancer cells. Previous work showed that hamster and human pancreatic tumors but not normal pancreata exhibit low-affinity cell-membrane receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Although the regression of experimental pancreatic cancers induced by treatment with LHRH agonists or antagonists could be explained in part by the creation of sex-steroid deficiency, direct effects mediated by LHRH receptors might also play a role. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic tumor cells do exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes. These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor cells. Immunoreactive sites in the nucleus also were found in a restricted set of normal hamster pituitary cells thought to be luteinizing hormone-secreting cells and in MXT mouse mammary tumor cells. Such nuclear receptors may be involved in the transmission of the direct action of LHRH analogues on the tumor cells, resulting in the enhancement of programmed cell death. 
Pneumonitis associated with coinfection by human herpesvirus 6 and Legionella in an immunocompetent adult. The authors report a case of pneumonitis in a young healthy man caused by coinfection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and Legionella pneumophila. The patient's course was complicated by severe respiratory, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system dysfunctions, which were believed to be primarily the results of his Legionella infection. Aggressive antibiotic treatment produced no response, and Legionella remained isolatable from lung tissue throughout several weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Human herpesvirus 6 was isolated from a sample of peripheral blood during the acute stage of the patient's illness, and numerous HHV-6--infected macrophages and lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy-derived lung tissue. Paradoxically treatment of the patient with high-dose corticosteroids resulted in dramatic improvement of his condition, including clearance of the Legionella infection. The demonstration that corticosteroids efficiently inhibit HHV-6 replication in vitro suggests that the virus may have contributed to the patient's pneumonitis by enhancing tissue inflammation, by compromising the function of pulmonary macrophages, and, perhaps, by destroying the patient's CD4+ T lymphocytes. Human herpesvirus 6 may be able to function as a synergistic cofactor in lung infections by Legionella and other pathogens. 
Determination of cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction with magnetic resonance phase imaging. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rates in 12 patients with symptoms suggestive of CSF shunt obstruction were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) phase imaging. The shunts were imaged over the skull, just distal to any reservoir, using a curved surface coil. Images perpendicular to the direction of flow were made on a 1.5-tesla clinical unit with a flow-sensitive pulse sequence. The patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 28 years. All patients had ancillary investigations to determine the functional status of the shunt. No flow was detected in seven patients with blocked shunts. Flow rates between 3 and 40 cc/hr were found in three patients with functioning shunts. Two patients, one with a blocked shunt and one with a functioning shunt, could not be imaged due to motion artifact. Magnetic resonance phase imaging is a promising technique in the determination of CSF shunt obstruction. 
An analysis of the aetiology of early childhood deafness. It is generally believed that one in every thousand children is profoundly deaf. An understanding of the aetiology of early childhood deafness and timely detection is crucial in rehabilitation of these children. This study analyses the aetiology of early childhood deafness and shows that deafness is more often acquired than inherited. Non-syndromic deafness, especially occurring on its own, usually produces profoundly deaf children and thus there is the need for genetic studies--in the child, laterally, and longitudinally into generations. Meningitis appears to be the commonest cause of acquired deafness, especially if due to pneumococcus. Only 40 of the 80 cases presented before the age of 2 years. It was therefore interesting to note what factors invoked awareness of deafness to facilitate early presentation. 
The effect of cryopreservation on the development of S- and G2-phase mouse embryos. The survival rate and development of four-cell-stage mouse embryos frozen and thawed in S phase versus G2 phase was compared. Significantly more G2-phase than S-phase embryos survived freezing and thawing. In both groups, disruption of the zona pellucida, fusion of blastomeres, and dispersion of chromosomes were occasionally observed after thawing. Cryopreservation resulted in a longer delay in cleavage from the four- to the eight-cell stage of S (about 5 hr)- and G2-phase embryos (about 3 hr) compared to unfrozen controls. The number of frozen embryos which developed to the blastocyst stage was reduced compared to controls, and in the case of S-phase embryos, formation of the blastocyst cavity was also delayed. However, the average number of cells in the experimental and control embryos was similar. No increased incidence of chromosome abnormalities was seen. Our results suggest that freezing embryos in G2 is superior to freezing in S phase. 
The cosmetic effects of submucous resection. A prospective assessment of the complications of submucous resection is presented. Preoperative photographs were taken and a post-operative assessment was carried out at a minimum time of 2 years by questionnaire and photographs. No examples of significant cosmetic changes were found. 
Benign intrinsic tectal "tumors" in children. A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct. No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently. All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures. The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans. In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients. In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years). Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy. Five patients have had normal intellectual development. In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign. The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging. 
Laser midline glossectomy as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Multiple site specific procedures have been proposed to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Midline glossectomy (MLG) is a procedure that directly enlarges the hypopharyngeal airspace using the carbon dioxide laser. The initial experience of 12 patients is presented. Midline glossectomy as the sole procedure was performed on 11 patients who had failed uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and who were felt to have significant hypopharyngeal collapse on physical examination and Muller's maneuver. One patient with primary hypopharyngeal narrowing underwent MLG. Five (42%) were considered responders with Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) decreasing from 60.6 per hour to 14.5 per hour. In seven nonresponders, there was no significant change in the RDI (62.6 events per hour to 48.4 events per hour). Cephalometric analysis showed that responders tended to be more retrognathic (sella-nasion-supramentale (S-N-B = 74.4 degrees)) than nonresponders (S-N-B = 79.3 degrees). Responders were significantly less obese (body mass index (BMI = 30.6)) than nonresponders (BMI = 37.9). There were five minor complications including minor bleeding (n = 3), prolonged odynophagia (n = 1), and minor change in taste (n = 1). There were no major complications, and no persistent difficulties with speech or swallowing. These results demonstrate that direct surgical modification of the tongue base and associated structures can significantly impact obstructive apnea. Midline glossectomy or similar procedures may be useful in a subset of patients with OSAS. 
Clonality and clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple nodules. To determine the clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, the integrated hepatitis B virus DNA patterns of the main tumor, satellites and/or metastatic lesions were analyzed by Southern-blot hybridization in 28 hepatocellular carcinomas, including three HBsAg-seronegative cases. Unicentric or multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological criteria in 89% of the cases. Among 17 unicentric hepatocellular carcinomas, minor changes of the integration pattern--including partial loss or addition of the integration sites or both--were detected in the metastatic lesions in 29% of the cases. Furthermore, none of five cases with free-form hepatitis B virus DNA in the primary tumor had detectable free hepatitis B virus DNA in the metastatic lesions. These results suggest that the alteration of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA pattern during the course of tumor growth and metastasis may occur more often than previously perceived and that the switch-off of virus replication may be related to tumor metastatic potential. In eight cases with unilateral, multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma, two clones were detected in six cases, three were seen in another and four were seen in one. One case of note was a 9-yr-old boy with two histological types and two different integration patterns, one associated with vascular invasion and lung metastasis. Three patients with bilateral hepatocellular carcinoma were confirmed to have bicentric or tricentric hepatocellular carcinoma rather than intrahepatic dissemination and had survival rates similar to those in unicentric hepatocellular carcinoma. Three invasive HBsAg-seronegative hepatocellular carcinomas were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA integration and were of unicentric origin. 
Electroencephalographic correlations of extracranial and epidural electrodes in temporal lobe epilepsy. Thirty patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin, but no structural abnormalities on neuroradiologic investigations, had both extracranial (scalp) and epidural EEG recordings. Fifteen patients (50%) had localized, unilateral, ictal, scalp EEGs, but one of these had bilateral independent temporal seizure onset according to epidural recordings. Of the 15 patients in whom scalp EEGs were non-localizing, 12 had well-localized epidural ictal EEGs, and 3 had multifocal or bilateral independent temporal ictal recordings. Epidural recordings provide information for determination of site of onset of temporal lobe seizures in selected patients. 
Acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors induced by interleukin-1 alpha: effects independent of tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein synthesized in response to the endotoxin bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is the classical mediator of acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. We have demonstrated that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), with a spectrum of activities very similar to those of TNF, also causes acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. Both TNF and IL-1 induce a cascade of events including the synthesis or release of each other. The present studies were thus undertaken to determine whether the hemorrhagic necrosis induced in tumors by IL-1 alpha is due to TNF. Kinetic parameters of IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage were similar to those observed with recombinant murine TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) or LPS in RIF-1 fibrosarcomas in C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) mice. However, the amount of TNF found in the sera or tumors of animals treated with LPS was more than 20-fold higher than in mice treated with IL-1 alpha, and LPS induced similar degrees of hemorrhagic necrosis, which was measured by determining the packed volume of red blood cells by 59Fe labeling. A low but significantly hemorrhagic dose of IL-1 alpha induced no detectable TNF in tumors. Pretreatment with 250 micrograms of neutralizing antibody to TNF had no effect on IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage, whereas TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced hemorrhagic effects were significantly reduced. These results demonstrate an important antitumor activity of IL-1 alpha that appears to be independent of TNF. 
Detection of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage after pancreas transplantation: value of CT and cystography. Leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of the graft is difficult to diagnose clinically. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with fluoroscopic cystography and CT to determine their relative merit in the diagnosis of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage as documented by surgical exploration in pancreas transplant recipients. Thirteen leaks were diagnosed by fluoroscopic cystography or by CT in 11 patients after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of pancreatic fluid. Conventional retrograde fluoroscopic cystography showed 11 leaks; CT with retrograde bladder opacification showed three leaks. Of the five CT studies that did not show a leak and that also were done within 7 days of a cystogram with abnormal findings, failure to use retrograde bladder opacification accounted for the majority (three cases) of missed diagnoses. Focal or free peritoneal abdominal fluid was seen in all CT examinations, with extravasation of contrast material seen into both walled-off collections and free ascites. Our experience suggests that retrograde bladder and duodenal stump opacification should be a routine part of the CT evaluation performed to detect leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation. 
Breast cancer in men: aspects of familial aggregation. Familial aggregation of breast cancer in males was investigated in a population-based case-control study. Cases were ascertained from 10 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registries in the United States between 1983 and 1986. Controls were identified by random-digit dialing and from lists of Medicare recipients. The relative odds of developing breast cancer were similar in men with affected paternal and maternal relatives and in men with affected mothers and sisters. The risk increased with the number of affected relatives. The relative odds of developing breast cancer were greater in men with first-degree relatives who developed their mammary neoplasm before the age of 45 than in men with older first-degree affected relatives; the enhancement of risk in men with an affected sister was greater in those under age 60 than in older men. These results are similar to those observed by others in studies of breast cancer in women. 
Mitral valve repair: a valuable procedure with good long term results even when performed infrequently. OBJECTIVE--To assess the results of mitral valve repair in a series with a low frequency of repair despite a policy to conserve the valve whenever possible. DESIGN--Retrospective review of case notes with clinical and echocardiographic examination of survivors. SETTING--Cardiac surgery unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS--62 consecutive patients undergoing mitral valve repair by one surgeon between 1979 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS--Mitral valve repair according to the criteria and techniques of Carpentier. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of repair, operative mortality, actuarial survival, freedom from reoperation and thromboembolism, clinical state, and echocardiographic state. RESULTS--The 62 patients, median age 58 years (interquartile range 51 to 64 years), represent 14% (70% confidence interval 12% to 15%) of the 454 mitral valve operations performed in the study period. Operative mortality was 8% (70% CI 5% to 13%). Actuarial survival was 62% (70% CI 43% to 81%) at nine years. At nine years actuarial freedom from reoperation was 91% (70% CI 79% to 102%) and freedom from thromboembolism 91% (70% CI 80% to 102%). At a median follow up of 33 months (interquartile range 21 to 74 months), 38 of 46 survivors had improved functional state. Of 21 patients who underwent echocardiography one had severe mitral regurgitation and one mitral stenosis. CONCLUSION--Although compared with other reports of mitral valve repair the prevalence of repair was low in this series the results are comparable and justify a positive approach to repair in all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery even if this can only be achieved in a small proportion of patients. 
A combination trial of human lymphoblastoid interferon and bestrabucil (KM2210) for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Both human lymphoblastoid interferon (HLBI) and bestrabucil, the conjugate of chlorambucil and beta-estradiol, have antitumor activity against adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Because an in vitro study showed that these two agents combined had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on MOLT-4 and WI-38VA13 cell lines, the authors evaluated the clinical efficacy of this combination in a pilot study with a poor-risk group of ATLL patients. The patients were treated daily with 6 x 10(6) IU of HLBI subcutaneously and 100 mg of bestrabucil orally. In patients with lymphoma-type ATLL or hypercalcemia, prednisolone also was given daily. Of 12 patients suitable for evaluation, nine had partial responses, one had a minor response, and two had no response. All five patients with skin infiltration and both patients with hypercalcemia responded. A history of prior chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. The time to clinical response was 3 to 16 days (median, 11 days) after initiation of treatment. The response duration was 4 to 108+ weeks (median, 9 weeks), but all patients except one relapsed, even during continuing treatment. No serious side effects were observed. Although the response rate with this combination treatment was high, the response duration was short, and other treatments would have to be added to achieve control of this aggressive disease. 
Fatal tonsillar herniation in pseudotumor cerebri. A 27-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri died after lumbar puncture secondary to tonsillar herniation. Five years earlier she had a respiratory arrest after lumbar puncture. MRI and autopsy ruled out the presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation or a mass lesion of the posterior fossa, but midsagittal views suggested the presence of low-lying cerebellar tonsils. 
Liesegang rings developing within intraperitoneal endometriotic implants. A case report. Liesegang rings are acellular, laminated structures that have been reported to accompany a variety of necrotizing and hemorrhagic tissue processes. Although most frequently seen in the kidneys and synovium, they can be present in other tissues. Liesegang rings are of importance because they are frequently confused by pathologists with helminth ova and nematodes, which they resemble. A case of Liesegang rings was associated with intraperitoneal endometriotic implants, with which the rings appeared to have originated. 
Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility. This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD. Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD. 
Surgical treatment for a case of postoperative Pseudallescheria boydii endophthalmitis. Pseudallescheria boydii (P. boydii) is an uncommon ocular pathogen which previously has been identified in only 10 of 905 fungal isolates identified by the Sid Richardson Microbiology Laboratory at the Cullen Eye Institute of Baylor College of Medicine. Furthermore, only one case of postoperative P. boydii endophthalmitis and four cases of endogenous P. boydii endophthalmitis have been reported. Three of the four patients with endogenous endophthalmitis died within 4 weeks of diagnosis. We describe a second case of postoperative endophthalmitis due to this fungus. The infection was successfully eradicated following vitrectomy, corneoscleral resection, and patch graft, in addition to intraocular, topical, and oral antifungal medication. Although in vitro sensitivities are variable, P. boydii is known to be relatively resistant to amphotericin B. This points to the importance of proper cultures and sensitivities when treating cases of suspected fungal endophthalmitis. Unfortunately, the patient's eye became phthisical 6 months following the initial intervention. 
Antibiotic treatment of tuboovarian abscess: comparison of broad-spectrum beta-lactam agents versus clindamycin-containing regimens. One hundred nineteen patients with tuboovarian abscess were evaluated for response to antibiotics. Results were stratified into three groups by antimicrobial regimen. Group 1 consisted of 37 patients treated with a single-agent broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic and oral doxycycline. Initial clinical response (defined as decreased pain, diminished white blood cell count, or defervescence) in group 1 was 31/37 (84%). Group 2 consisted of 64 patients treated with clindamycin in combination with an aminoglycoside with or without a penicillin. There was an initial clinical response in 45 of 64 (70%). Group 3 consisted of 18 patients from group 1 who were changed to a clindamycin-containing regimen after 2 to 3 days of initial treatment with a single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotic. The decision to switch antibiotics was not based on treatment failure but occurred when delayed ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of tuboovarian abscess. The switch reflected physician preference for clindamycin-containing regimens in the treatment of tuboovarian abscesses. The response rate in this subset of patients was 14 of 18 (78%). Overall initial clinical response rate was 90 of 119 (75%). There were no statistically significant demographic or clinical differences among the three groups. There was no statistical difference in the rate of early and late antibiotic failure rates among the groups. Our study demonstrates that extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefoxitin, in conjunction with doxycycline has efficacy that is equivalent to that of clindamycin-containing regimens. An overall medical treatment success rate of 75% suggests that conservative treatment of tuboovarian abscesses is warranted. 
Hemodynamic response with passive neck flexion in brain death. Twelve brain-dead patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology, Osaka University Hospital, from July 1988 to August 1989 were studied. A hemodynamic response elicited by passive neck flexion was observed in 10 of the 12 patients. After passive neck flexion, blood pressure began to rise, and the heart rate increased slightly. Blood pressure peaked about 2 minutes after the initiation of neck flexion and then decreased gradually to the baseline level within a few minutes. These responses were suppressed completely by administration of the ganglion blocker trimethaphan camsilate, which suggests that the efferent pathway of the response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation in Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis. Twenty-two patients with Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis had a posterior chamber intraocular lens implanted after extracapsular cataract extraction. After a mean follow-up period of 2.5 years (range, 6 to 70 months) half the patients had a visual acuity of 1.0 or more. The results compare favourably with those in the general population. 
The effect of hyperventilation in cluster headache patients. The effect of voluntary hyperventilation was assessed in 22 cluster headache patients (8 in a cluster period and 14 in a remission) and 19 healthy individuals. Using an ear oximeter and a capnograph with a nasal probe, the oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the end-tidal CO2 were monitored continuously. During the hyperventilation per se, cluster headache patients and controls showed absolute values of end-tidal CO2 and of SaO2 of the same order of magnitude. In the posthyperventilation phase, however, the average of the lowest SaO2 levels was lower in controls than in cluster headache patients. In the posthyperventilation phase, headache patients outside the cluster period showed a trend more similar to that of the controls with respect to SaO2 than did those inside the cluster period. The observed discrepancy might, if reproducible, be a consequence of an altered chemoreceptor sensitivity in cluster headache patients during the bout. 
Changes in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of "hepatic functional reserve." Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. 
Bedside diagnostic blood testing. Its accuracy, rapidity, and utility in blood conservation. OBJECTIVE.--Bedside diagnostic testing utilizing microchemistry instruments potentially offers physicians the opportunity to evaluate urgent blood test results rapidly and reliably using only drops (250 microL) of whole blood. The use of microchemistry technology may also represent an essential component of a blood conservation program in acutely ill patients. We tested the hypothesis that a microchemistry instrument would have important advantages in the intensive care unit, including rapid turnaround time, decreased iatrogenic blood loss, and the provision of accurate analyte results. DESIGN.--One-year prospective, random-sample comparative study. SETTING.--A tertiary, acute care, 1000-bed university teaching hospital and a 450-bed university-affiliated community hospital. PATIENTS.--Blood samples from 850 patients were analyzed. RESULTS.--There were strong correlations (for pH, R2 = .97; PCO2, R2 = .97; PO2, R2 = .99; sodium, R2 = .83; potassium, R2 = .94; chloride, R2 = .90; glucose, R2 = .98; and hematocrit, R2 = .92) when paired samples were analyzed simultaneously in the laboratory comparing the microchemistry instrument and currently accepted clinical laboratory instruments. There were significant correlations (for pH, R2 = .91; PCO2, R2 = .94; PO2, R2 = .97; sodium, R2 = .91; potassium, R2 = .86; chloride, R2 = .91; ionized calcium, R2 = .82; glucose, R2 = .96; and hematocrit, R2 = .75) but increased variability occurred in some analyte results when samples were first analyzed in the intensive care unit (using the microchemistry instrument) and then transported to the laboratory in the routine fashion for "stat" determinations. CONCLUSIONS.--The multichannel microchemistry instrument provided accurate analyte determinations when compared with accepted clinical laboratory instruments. Significant savings of time and blood were also realized by the use of a microchemistry instrument in the intensive care unit. Bedside microchemistry may provide clinically important advantages in emergency departments, operating rooms, and neonatal, pediatric, coronary, adult medical and surgical, trauma, and burn intensive care units. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen levels in peritoneal washings can predict peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of gastric cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were determined in the peritoneal washings from 120 patients with gastric cancer and 9 patients with benign diseases. Elevated values (greater than 100 ng/g of protein) were observed in 20 of 25 patients with gastric cancer with visible dissemination and 16 of 25 patients with serosal invasion but no dissemination. The same elevation was found in only 9 of 70 patients with no serosal invasion and none of the patients with benign disease. The 2-year survival rates after curative operation for the patients with and without elevation of CEA levels were 21% (19 patients) and 100% (66 patients), respectively (P less than 0.001). A negative correlation was found between CEA levels and survival times after noncurative operation. These results indicate that the CEA level in peritoneal washings could be a sensitive detector of invisible peritoneal dissemination and a new predictor for the postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer. 
The clinical management of cirrhosis. The discipline of hepatology is being rapidly advanced by several methods of investigation, most notably those of molecular and genetic biology. The polymerase chain reaction holds very great promise in unraveling the implications of hepatic virus infections. At the present time, we have no method of reversing established cirrhosis, and those with life threatening impairment of liver function can only look to liver transplants for salvage. The clinician can therefore best serve by identifying liver disease before cirrhosis and its complications occur. With effective case finding, and the continued development of therapeutic interventions directed toward known or suspected etiologic and pathogenic factors, many productive, high-quality years can be added to the lifespans of many patients. 
Ossified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. 
Iodine 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and biochemical analyses in suspected pheochromocytoma. Detection of abnormal catecholamine levels and localization of tumor mass are important factors in the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma. Iodine 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was performed in 64 patients with suspected pheochromocytoma if their urinary catecholamine levels were borderline or elevated, or if the clinical suspicion for pheochromocytoma was high in spite of normal urinary catecholamine determinations. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans were evaluated for abnormal localization of tracer. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed for vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Thirty of the 64 patients had pheochromocytomas. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan had a sensitivity and a specificity of 88%. The 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid and norepinephrine measurements had the best sensitivity (97%), while the vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid measurements had the best specificity (91%). In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and the 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were normal, no pheochromocytomas were found. In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were abnormal, a pheochromocytoma was always present. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan often documents the presence or absence of a pheochromocytoma and provides localization of the tumor in the preoperative evaluation of these patients. 
Propranolol in prevention of recurrent bleeding from severe portal hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhosis. The two main causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis are oesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Rebleeding from varices can be prevented by beta-blockers, but it is not clear whether these drugs effectively reduce rebleeding from PHG. 54 cirrhotic patients with acute or chronic bleeding from severe PHG took part in a randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of propranolol in prevention of rebleeding from PHG. 26 patients were randomised to receive propranolol daily at a dose that reduced the resting heart rate by 25% or to 55 bpm (20-160 mg twice daily), throughout mean follow-up of 21 (SD 11) months. 28 untreated controls were followed-up, with the same examinations, for 18 (13) months. The actuarial percentages of patients free of rebleeding from PHG were significantly higher in the propranolol-treated patients than in the untreated controls at 12 months (65% vs 38%; p less than 0.05) and at 30 months of follow-up (52% vs 7%; p less than 0.05). Propranolol-treated patients had fewer episodes of acute bleeding than controls (0.010 [0.004] vs 0.120 [0.040] per patient per month). Multivariate analysis showed that absence of propranolol treatment was the only predictive variable for rebleeding. Actuarial survival was slightly higher in the propranolol group than in the controls, but the difference was not significant. Thus, long-term propranolol treatment significantly reduces the frequency of rebleeding from severe PHG, and may improve the prognosis of cirrhotic patients with this disorder. 
Efficacy of pulmonary metastasectomy for recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. To evaluate surgical results of resection of second (recurrent) pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma, the survival of 39 patients was analyzed retrospectively. With the exclusion of two patients (one with interval metastases between staged resections and one without histologically proved metastases), three patients were found to have unresectable disease (median survival, 7 months). A significantly (P = 0.0001) longer median survival (28 months) was found for 34 patients whose recurrent metastases were completely resected. The only other factor predicting significantly longer post-thoracotomy survival was resection of a solitary metastatic nodule (median survival, 65 months). Patients who had two or more recurrent nodules resected had a median survival of 14 months only (P = 0.01). Although trends toward longer survival were noted for other prognostic factors, none reached statistical significance. We conclude that the complete resection of a solitary second (recurrent) pulmonary metastatic nodule from adult soft tissue sarcoma predicts long-term survival. 
Effects of interferon on intrahepatic human leukocyte antigens and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis. 
Thymic targets for Abelson murine leukemia virus are early gamma/delta T lymphocytes. Molecular analysis has shown that the majority of Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MuLV)-induced primary thymomas represent transformed gamma/delta thymocytes. Many of these thymomas are of monoclonal origin as judged by provirus integration pattern and contain rearranged genes encoding T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta chains but germ-line immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Some of the monoclonal tumors contain multiple rearranged alleles encoding TCR gamma, delta, and beta chains. Further, one Ab-MuLV thymoma cell line contained germ-line-configuration TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes, which became rearranged after in vitro propagation. Clones of this cell line were observed to rearrange these genes after intrathymic passage. Also, some subclones of this cell line underwent rearrangement of their immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in culture. These observations suggest that the thymic targets for Ab-MuLV transformation are early gamma/delta thymocytes, some of which continue to rearrange their TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes. 
Changing patterns in presentation and management of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in Northern Ireland, 1970-1988 The clinical features, diagnostic methods, management and survival in 16 cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome encountered in Northern Ireland between the years 1970 and 1988 are described. While the majority of patients in the first decade of the study period had surgical treatment, those presenting in the latter period have been managed with medical therapy in the form of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole. The increasing use of these agents seems to be altering the severe clinical features of this condition, reducing the indications for surgery and maintaining patients, with or without evidence of metastatic disease, in clinical remission. 
Ovarian cyst aspiration and the outcome of in vitro fertilization. This study was designed to ascertain whether any benefit would be derived from aspirating ovarian cysts identified before ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Thirty-seven patients who had ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups: group A (n = 14) with baseline ovarian cysts and group B (n = 23) with ovarian cysts that developed during pituitary suppression with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Each group was prospectively randomized into two subgroups depending on whether the ovarian cysts were aspirated or not. In group A, there was a significantly greater number of follicles and oocytes in the ovaries in which cysts were aspirated. However, there was no significant difference in the total number of follicles, oocytes retrieved and fertilized, or in the final outcome. In group B, there was no significant difference in folliculogenesis between the aspirated and nonaspirated subgroups. These observations suggest that the presence of a baseline ovarian cyst may reduce folliculogenesis but do not support routine cyst aspiration if the patient has two functional ovaries. 
Immediate effect of vagotomy on pancreatic insulin secretion. The effect of vagotomy and gastric resection on insulin secretion was examined by the glucagon stimulated C-peptide test in gastrectomy patients (n = 11) without truncal vagotomy and in total gastrectomy patients (n = 10) with truncal vagotomy. The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without truncal vagotomy was followed by a higher increase (48%) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with truncal vagotomy (13%). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without truncal vagotomy, whereas truncal vagotomy inhibited this increase. These results suggest that truncal vagotomy will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans. 
Cerebral hyperemia during spontaneous cluster headaches with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction to hyperoxia. Values for local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were measured in three dimensions utilizing xenon enhanced computerized tomography among patients during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches, during headache-free intervals and immediately after terminating attacks by inhalation of 100% oxygen. Results were compared with values measured among age-matched normal volunteers. LCBF values measured in five cluster patients while headache-free did not differ from similar measures among age-matched normal volunteers. In three patients during attacks of spontaneously occurring cluster headache, LCBF values for temporal cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical white matter were increased. Immediately after terminating attacks of cluster by 100% oxygen inhalation for five minutes, LCBF values for temporal cortex and basal ganglia became significantly decreased below normal values in five patients with spontaneously occurring cluster headache. Prompt relief of head pain by inhalation of 100% oxygen is associated with abolition of the hyperperfusion of both cortical and subcortical brain structures that occurs during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches and is followed by excessive cerebrovascular constriction. It remains to be determined whether the cerebral hyperemia occurring during cluster headaches is causally related to the head pain or is secondary to the pain itself. Rapid termination of head pain by hyperoxia associated with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction suggests that this vascular phenomenon is unique to cluster headache and offers clues to its pathogenesis. 
Lack of evidence for estrogen receptors in human and bovine parathyroid tissue. It has been hypothesized that estrogen may have a direct effect to reduce the set-point for PTH secretion which may be implicated in its hypocalcemic action. If this is so, estrogen receptors should be demonstrable within parathyroid tissue. Seven human parathyroid adenomas and five samples of normal bovine parathyroid tissue were examined using classical hormone-binding techniques. In no case was there evidence of displaceable estrogen binding of high affinity and low capacity. To exclude the presence of receptors within a small subset of the cells, five of the human adenomas were further studied by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the human estrogen receptor. In no case was there evidence of estrogen receptors. We conclude that the hypocalcemic action of estrogen replacement is unlikely to be mediated via a classical estrogen receptor within the parathyroid, although normal parathyroid tissue was not studied. 
Comparison of sucralfate and ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Ninety patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers, enrolled in this prospective, single-blind study, were randomized to sucralfate, 1 g q.i.d., 0.5 hour before meals on an empty stomach or at bedtime, or ranitidine, 150 mg b.i.d., for 4-8 weeks (phase I). Patients who healed during the treatment period were invited to participate in a maintenance therapy follow-up covering 1 year (phase II), during which they were treated with sucralfate, 1 g b.i.d. (before breakfast and at bedtime) or 150 mg of ranitidine at bedtime. After 4 weeks of treatment, healing rates were 30/40 (75.0%) with sucralfate and 36/42 (85.7%) with ranitidine, and healing rates were 39/40 (97.6%) and 40/42 (95.2%) respectively, after 8 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 6th and 12th months of phase II, respectively, relapse rates were 3/33 (9.4%) and 10/32 (31.3%) in the sucralfate group and 5/33 (15.2%) and 10/29 (34.5%) in the ranitidine group. Differences between sucralfate- and ranitidine-treated groups were not significant. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that sucralfate is as effective and safe as ranitidine in the short-term treatment and prevention of relapse in patients with ulcer disease. 
Aspirin in the prevention of thrombosis. More than a decade has passed since the introduction of the concept that inhibition of platelet function may be helpful in preventing the initiation of thrombus formation. Aspirin has been recognized as inhibiting normal platelet function and the mechanism has been clearly delineated. Legions of patients have been studied to answer the question of whether aspirin is efficacious in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. At the present time, however, a solid, clear answer is not available and firm recommendations cannot be made. A large number of studies evaluating aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in the prevention or delay of recurrent myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) have been completed and those studies reporting a favorable beneficial effect are in the minority. In these secondary prevention studies reporting success, the doses of aspirin employed were large enough to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase system and thromboxane A2 production as well as the synthesis of prostacyclin. Thus, in these studies if aspirin is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events, its efficacy is being mediated by an unknown mechanism. If the reader of the few studies that report positive results is convinced of the benefit of aspirin, it must be emphasized that thoughtful, cautious patient selection based upon the individual's cardiovascular risk profile must be exercised. Individual variation may exist with respect to aspirin's beneficial effect. It must be absolutely recognized that aspirin or any antiplatelet agent does not in any way substitute for the removal or treatment of coexisting risk factors such as tobacco, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic disease. In contrast to aspirin, control of the above risk factors has been established as beneficial. Aspirin is not free of undesirable side-effects; fatalities secondary to hemorrhage have been reported, and these must be known in detail and understood by both physician and patient before this agent is prescribed in the prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
A case report of massive vulvar edema during tocolysis of preterm labor. Bilateral vulvar edema that is not associated with preeclampsia has been reported only rarely during pregnancy or the puerperium. A primiparous patient in premature labor at 34 weeks' gestation with no history of lymphatic or venous obstruction underwent combination tocolysis with intravenous ritodrine and magnesium sulfate. On the fifth day of tocolysis, edema developed in the right labium majus pudendi and gradually spread to the left labia during the ensuing 24 hours. The patient remained afebrile, normotensive, and without signs of localized infection or anasarca. A trial of triple intravenous antibiotics and local skin care proved ineffective. By the ninth hospital day, the edema and discomfort had progressed, thereby precluding vaginal examination without sedation. In spite of progressive cervical dilatation with tocolysis, cesarean delivery was performed. With no further treatment, the vulvar edema gradually resolved during the next week. 
Steroid therapy for hydrops associated with antibody-mediated congenital heart block. Evaluation of fetal bradycardia noted during a routine prenatal visit at 24 weeks' gestation in a mother without symptoms showed an antibody-mediated heart block with anti-La (SSB) antibody present. The fetus had a pericardial effusion and ascites. After maternal steroid therapy, the ascites resolved and the pericardial effusion was substantially diminished. Steroid therapy may be a helpful adjunct for treatment of a premature infant with hydrops as a result of antibody-mediated heart block. 
Oral enoximone therapy in chronic heart failure: a placebo-controlled randomized trial. The Western Enoximone Study Group. In a parallel study design, 164 patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III heart failure were randomized to receive either enoximone given as 50 mg three times a day, or 100 mg three times a day, or a matching placebo. All patients were receiving digitalis and/or diuretics and had left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 45. Exercise tests were performed after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Enoximone produced significantly greater increases in exercise time than placebo treatment at weeks 4 and 8 (p = 0.012, p = 0.029, respectively) but not after 12 weeks. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly after the first dose of enoximone but not after 12 weeks of long-term therapy. Heart failure symptoms and the physicians' evaluations of cardiac status were significantly improved in both enoximone therapy groups during the first 4 weeks of evaluation when compared with evaluations of cardiac status in the placebo group. Diuretic doses were increased more frequently for patients who were receiving a placebo. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency in the placebo and 50 mg enoximone treatment groups; 100 mg enoximone resulted in a significantly greater incidence of adverse events. Mean heart rate and ventricular ectopic activity were not significantly different among the three treatment limbs. Enoximone appears to improve exercise tolerance, ventricular function, and symptoms of heart failure for 4 to 8 weeks. Heart rate, ventricular ectopic activity, and mortality rate were not increased. 
A 21-year experience with major hemorrhage after percutaneous liver biopsy Nine thousand two hundred twelve liver biopsies were performed according to a defined protocol, and data were prospectively recorded to identify risk factors for major bleeding. There were 10 fatal and 22 nonfatal hemorrhages (0.11% and 0.24%, respectively). By comparison with a control group that did not hemorrhage, malignancy, age, sex, and the number of passes were the only predictable risk factors. The risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients with malignancy is estimated to be 0.4%; for nonfatal hemorrhage, 0.57%. In patients undergoing liver biopsy for nonmalignant disease, the risks are 0.04% and 0.16%, respectively. 
Escherichia coli bacteremia in children. A review of 91 cases in 10 years. We reviewed 91 cases of pediatric Escherichia coli bacteremia during a 10-year period. Thirty one patients were afebrile; a significantly greater proportion of these patients were aged less than 1 month, had ampicillin-resistant E coli isolates, or had persistent bacteremia 24 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy. Infection was community acquired in 65 cases; associated urinary tract infection was six times more common in this setting than in nosocomially acquired infections. In 85 cases at least 1 underlying medical condition/focus of infection was identified at the time the positive blood culture was obtained, the most common were immune deficiency states (38 cases), urinary tract infection (29 cases), and lesions of the gastrointestinal tract (27 cases). Polymicrobial bacteremia occurred in five cases. Twelve patients died; significantly associated with death were hypotension requiring pressor therapy, presence of a central venous catheter, and neutropenia. 
Characterization of the mononuclear cell infiltrate and HLA-Dr expression in 19 oligodendrogliomas. We have studied frozen tissue from 19 oligodendrogliomas with a panel of antibodies to lymphocytes and their subsets, macrophages, natural killer cells, and HLA-Dr antigens. Macrophages were detected in moderate numbers in 60%-100% of tumors depending on the antibody used. T lymphocytes were fewer in number than macrophages and were present in 62% of cases. Most of the T lymphocytes were of the CD8 phenotype. CD4 lymphocytes were very few in number and present in only 18%. B cells and natural killer cells were absent from all cases. HLA-Dr antigens were expressed by macrophages in all cases but never on tumor cells. The implications of these findings are that macrophages and, to a lesser extent, CD8 lymphocytes are the predominant cells infiltrating oligodendrogliomas and that they may exert cellular immune functions. 
Rectal thiopental compared with intramuscular meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine for pediatric sedation. STUDY OBJECTIVES: We studied the hypothesis that rectal thiopental is an effective agent for emergency department pediatric sedation and may have advantages over a more traditional regimen. DESIGN: Rectal thiopental 25 mg/kg was compared with the combination of meperidine 2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Children between 18 months and 6 years of age presenting to our teaching hospital ED for laceration repair were entered after the clinical decision was made to sedate. Patients with altered sensorium, medical contraindications to sedation, or medication allergy were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: After informed consent, each patient received IM injection (drug combination or placebo) and rectal suspension (rectal thiopental or placebo) simultaneously. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and pediatric Glasgow Coma Scores were recorded before and every 15 minutes after sedation until discharge. Intradermal lidocaine and suturing began when the patient appeared adequately sedated, and response was numerically scored. Patients were discharged when able to stand. Twenty-nine patients 34 +/- 13 months old were studied. Fifteen patients received rectal thiopental, and 14 received the drug combination. Analysis using the Wilcoxon two-sample test revealed no differences in age, sex, weight, or wound location between groups. The time course of sedation was different for the two treatment regimens. At 15 and 30 minutes after administration, patients who received rectal thiopental were more deeply sedated than those who received the drug combination, as evidenced by significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores (P less than .05). Accordingly, time from medication administration to suturing was 29 +/- 12 minutes in the thiopental group and 54 +/- 33 minutes (P less than .01) in the drug combination group. Patients in the thiopental group also recovered more quickly and were discharged approximately one-half hour earlier than those in the drug combination group (89 +/- 25 vs 120 +/- 44 minutes, P less than .05). No difference in response to lidocaine injection or suturing was demonstrated between the groups. Laceration repair time was comparable between the groups. There were eight sedation failures (three of 15 in thiopental group and five of 14 in drug combination group, P = NS). Vital signs remained stable, no adverse reactions occurred, and no patient had decreased oxygen saturation to less than 95%. CONCLUSION: Rectal thiopental is superior to this drug combination for pediatric sedation because it can be administered painlessly, has a more rapid onset and offset of action, and is of equal safety and efficacy at the dosage studied. 
The orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: evaluation of autonomic function and treatment with octreotide and ergot alkaloids. Orthostatic tachycardia is a poorly understood syndrome in which patients develop dizziness, diaphoresis, or palpitations upon shifting from the supine to the upright posture. The present study was performed to determine whether autonomic neuropathy might be present in these patients, and whether the abnormal hemodynamic response to standing might be the result of failure of reflex vasoconstriction. We measured autonomic function in 9 patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and 2 patients with orthostatic tachycardia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared them to 33 age-matched controls. Although most patients with orthostatic tachycardia had normal vasomotor reflexes and normal surface potential amplitudes, the latency of the autonomic response, a measure of sympathetic nerve conduction velocity, was prolonged in the soles (2.44 +/- 0.08 s in patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia vs. 2.12 +/- 0.04 s in controls; P less than 0.005). In 6 of 9 patients, however, the latencies were within the normal range. Autonomic surface potentials were absent in 1 diabetic patient with orthostatic tachycardia; the latency of the response in the feet was greatly prolonged (2.95 s) in the second patient. We also assessed the response of orthostatic tachycardia patients to octreotide and dihydroergotamine, which are known to have a pressor effect in patients with recognized forms of autonomic neuropathy. These agents, in combination, suppressed orthostatic tachycardia (from 116 +/- 7 to 89 +/- 6 beats/min; P less than 0.001) in patients with this syndrome. In summary, our data indicate that evidence of autonomic dysfunction is present in only a minority of patients with orthostatic tachycardia. Nevertheless, administration of the vasoconstrictor drugs dihydroergotamine and octreotide can prevent the abnormal hemodynamic response to the upright posture shown by patients with this syndrome. 
Indium-111-leukocyte imaging in acute cholecystitis. Eleven patients with suspected acute cholecystitis underwent sequential 99mTc-iminodiacetic derivative (IDA) and 111In-white blood cell (WBC) imaging to determine if 111In-WBCs accumulate within an acutely inflamed hemorrhagic gallbladder wall and, thus, could be employed as a reasonable alternative to 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis. Seven patients had surgically confirmed acute cholecystitis. Of these cases, five had a true-positive 99mTc-IDA and 111In-WBC, one an indeterminate 111In-WBC and true-positive 99mTc-IDA, and one a true-positive 111In-WBC and false-negative 99mTc-IDA scan. The remaining four patients did not have acute cholecystitis. All visualized their gallbladder within 1 hr after 99mTc-IDA administration and none had 111In-WBC gallbladder wall uptake. Both 111In-WBC and 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy accurately detected acute cholecystitis: hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated a cystic duct obstruction and 111In-WBC imaging detected the inflammatory infiltrate within the gallbladder wall. The sensitivity and specificity of each was 86% and 100%, respectively. 
Variations in anatomy of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel: pitfalls in the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Two processes account for most instances of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: compression in the retroepicondylar groove, and compression by the humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade joining the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. While conventional electrodiagnostic criteria may localize an ulnar neuropathy to the elbow, separating retroepicondylar compression from humeroulnar arcade compression is more difficult. In 130 cadaver elbows, we examined the relationships between the medial epicondyle, flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar nerve. The humeroulnar arcade lay from 3 to 20 mm distal to the medial epicondyle, the intramuscular course of the nerve through the flexor carpi ulnaris ranged from 18 to 70 mm, and the nerve exited the flexor carpi ulnaris 28 to 69 mm distal to the medial epicondyle. In 6 specimens, dense fibrous bands bridged directly between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon proximal to the cubital tunnel proper; accessory epitrochleoanconeus muscles were present in 14 specimens: both may cause ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Anatomical variations may contribute to the difficulty in separating causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. 
Chronic persistent cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted. 
Peroneal nerve repair. Surgical results. Eleven patients had either repair (two) or nerve graft reconstruction (nine) of the common peroneal nerve or its superficial or deep divisions about the knee. The average follow-up period was 29.1 months. A good or excellent result was achieved in six (54.5%) patients. The results appeared best when direct nerve repair was possible or when a defect of 6 cm or less required grafting. Peroneal nerve exploration and repair or reconstruction as required seem indicated for known nerve disruption or unknown nerve continuity if there is no suggestion of continuing recovery by three to six months after the injury. 
Large-cell lymphoma presenting with hepatic sinusoidal infiltration. We describe a case of large-cell lymphoma of B-cell phenotype with clinicopathologic features resembling malignant histiocytosis. The clinical presentation was characterized by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzyme levels. These features and the finding of a predominantly sinusoidal infiltrate of neoplastic cells on liver biopsy raised the suspicion of malignant histiocytosis. The patient subsequently developed supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which proved to be due to a diffuse large-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypic studies performed on the lymph node and the original liver biopsy specimen established the B-cell nature of neoplastic cells at both sites. This case highlights a rare pattern of hepatic involvement by large-cell lymphoma, and contrasts the latter with other hematologic disorders associated with hepatic sinusoidal infiltrates. 
Anetodermic prurigo nodularis (with Pautrier's neuroma) responsive to arotinoid acid. A woman had symmetrically distributed pruritic nodules for more than 40 years. Microscopically they were characterized by proliferation of nonmyelinated nerve fibers (Pautrier's neuroma) and a total absence of epidermal involvement. Anetoderma developed at the site of former nodules. Her condition responded favorably to repeated retinoid therapy with regression of nodules in those sites in which retinoid dermatitis had developed. 
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney: CT, sonographic, and pathologic correlation. The sonographic and computed tomographic findings in 12 children aged 1-6 years with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney were reviewed retrospectively. Tumor size, calcification, and internal architecture were characterized and correlated with the gross pathologic findings. All tumors were unilateral and large (8.5-16 cm in diameter). Except for one, all masses were predominantly solid, and all contained some well-defined portions of low attenuation or hypoechogenicity that represented tumor necrosis. In addition, seven tumors contained uncomplicated fluid-filled cysts with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to 5 cm. Extension into the inferior vena cava was not noted. The radiologic features of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney are common to all malignant renal neoplasms. Some cases, however, may have features that simulate those of benign conditions, such as multilocular cystic nephroma or segmental cystic dysplasia. No pattern was discerned that would permit discrimination between clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and the most common renal neoplasm of childhood, Wilms tumor. 
Flow velocity waveforms of the fetal circulation preceding fetal death in a case of lupus anticoagulant. Flow velocity waveforms of the vascular system were evaluated at 25 weeks 2 days and 27 weeks 5 days of gestation in the case of a severely growth-retarded fetus. At the first scan, the cerebral vessels displayed low pulsatility indexes, reflecting the brain-sparing pattern that characterizes fetal stress. This compensatory reduction was lost at the time of the second, "preterminal" scan. 
Adenocarcinoma of rete testis. Role of inguinal orchiectomy plus retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Adenocarcinoma of the rete testis is diagnosed rarely. We describe the clinical and pathologic findings in a forty-seven-year-old man with this unusual tumor. Treatment modalities are reviewed emphasizing the role of radical orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. 
The clinical spectrum of renal osteodystrophy in 57 chronic hemodialysis patients: a correlation between biochemical parameters and bone pathology findings. Fifty-nine chronic hemodialysis patients who had been on dialysis for an average of 77 months underwent bone biopsies and the pathologic findings were correlated with biochemical and demographic data. All but two had evidence of renal osteodystrophy, 23 with osteitis fibrosa (OF), 19 with osteomalacia and/or adynamic disease (OM/AD), and 15 with mixed osteodystrophy (MOD). Patients in each group were similar with regard to age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis, unstimulated serum aluminum, calcium and phosphorus. Patients with osteitis fibrosa (OF) had statistically higher DFO stimulated aluminum, alkaline phosphatase and PTHC levels than the other two groups although there was marked individual variation. The bone biopsies were also evaluated for the amount of aluminum deposited in the osteoid seam. All 23 of the patients with OF and 11 of the 15 patients with MOD had no, mild, or minimal aluminum deposition but 12 of the 19 patients with OM/AD had moderate to marked aluminum deposition. Patients with minimal to mild aluminum deposition were similar in age, duration of dialysis, sex distribution, unstimulated and DFO stimulated aluminum levels, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase to those with moderate to marked deposition but had significantly higher parathormone levels. All patients had been treated in a similar fashion regarding diet, oral phosphate binders and vitamin D; therefore, the observed differences in bone pathology were not readily explicable. However, patients who were found to have osteitis fibrosa and those with minimal to mild aluminum deposition had significantly higher parathormone levels when compared with patients in the other groups at the inception of dialysis. 
Asthma deaths. Deaths from asthma seem to be increasing in spite of considerable improvements in drug treatment and management plans. There are many hypotheses to explain this, but little emphasis has been placed on the possibility that confidence in better drug treatments may modify patients' behavior so as to place them at greater risk of illness. It is well recognized that excessive confidence in bronchodilator inhalers and nebulizers can make patients stay away from hospitals too long during acute attacks. It is also very possible that prevention of symptoms by use of antiasthma drugs could allow patients to spend more time in environments containing antigens or other agents that provoke asthma, resulting in more serious and long-lasting bronchial inflammation and reactivity. 
Longitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. 
The importance of surface immunoglobulin, mouse rosettes, and CD5 in the immunophenotyping of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reactive lymphocytosis. Peripheral blood from 167 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 119 reactive lymphocytosis (RLC) patients were analyzed to evaluate the immunophenotypic diagnostic value of mouse rosettes (M-rosette), and weak expression of monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (SIg). In B-CLL, 145 cases were M-rosette+ (86.83%), 135 surface immunoglobulin (SIg)+ (80.84%), and 117 M-rosette+ SIg+ (70.06%). Of 32 SIg- cases, 28 were M-rosette+; and of 22 M-rosette-cases, 18 were SIg+. By combining results of the two assays and accepting positivity of either one or both as sufficient for diagnosis, B-CLL was diagnosed in 163 cases (97.60%). CD5 was performed in 49 cases of the 167 with paired data for SIg and M-rosettes. By combining the results of the three assays and accepting positivity of any two or all three as sufficient for diagnosis, all 49 cases (100%) were diagnosed. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between M-rosette, SIg, and CD5 expression. The results demonstrate the independent expression of the three markers, and their complementary role in immunophenotyping B-CLL. In RLC, all 119 cases were T-lineage and SIg-, and 115 were M-rosette-, indicating the role of the two markers in differentiating B-CLL from RLC. Three of the four M-rosette+ T-RLC were subsequently diagnosed as B-CLL, suggesting the necessity of follow-up of such cases. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Cerebral hemorrhagic risk of aspirin or heparin therapy with thrombolytic treatment in rabbits. We studied the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage in an animal model of embolic stroke to determine the safety of aspirin, heparin, and tissue plasminogen activator therapies. We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of rabbits with labeled blood clots and administered either tissue plasminogen activator, heparin, aspirin, tissue plasminogen activator plus aspirin, tissue plasminogen activator plus heparin, or saline at various times after stroke. Compared to saline controls, both the aspirin-only and the tissue plasminogen activator-plus-aspirin groups had a significantly higher incidence of cerebral hemorrhage, whereas the heparin and tissue plasminogen activator combination groups did not. We conclude that aspirin antiplatelet therapy alone may increase the risk of hemorrhagic infarction, whereas heparin or tissue plasminogen activator therapy appears to be relatively safe. 
Evaluation of the patient with stable angina following coronary artery bypass surgery. Bypass graft stenosis and occlusion are relatively common events, occurring eventually in the majority of patients who survive beyond 5 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These processes, in combination with progressive native coronary artery disease, lead to recurrent angina and an increased need for medication in most patients late after surgery. Patients with unstable ischemic symptoms generally should proceed directly to coronary arteriography, whereas patients with stable angina may be candidates for noninvasive testing to evaluate their risk and the extent of myocardial jeopardy. If the initial revascularization procedure is successful, preoperative thallium 201 imaging abnormalities should be reversed. Persistent abnormalities beyond 6 months after revascularization indicate incomplete revascularization or perioperative infarction. Defects noted in the immediate postoperative period may be areas of myocardial stunning or hibernation, which can require up to 6 months to reverse. If chest pain recurs after revascularization, a normal thallium 201 perfusion pattern indicates that the symptom is probably not ischemic in nature. Thallium 201 perfusion abnormalities may precede symptoms by several months and may be the only indication of significant myocardial ischemia in patients with silent ischemia. Advanced tomographic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), should theoretically improve disease detection and localization following revascularization. Practically speaking, only the left anterior descending coronary bed is well evaluated by these tomographic imaging techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT imaging for evaluation of posterior circulation abnormalities remains unacceptably low. Complexities of competitive flow and collateralization that may exist in the postoperative period make it difficult to relate perfusion abnormalities to a specific graft stenosis. However, tomographic perfusion imaging may provide useful correlative information on the functional impact of bypass graft stenoses in patients with recurrent angina who have undergone coronary angiography and in whom the angiographic indications for repeat surgery or angioplasty are not compelling. Newer tomographic and metabolic imaging techniques such as CT, NMRI, and PET remain unproven as diagnostic tests for the evaluation of unselected patient populations presenting with recurrent angina following revascularization surgery. 
Brain tumors occurring before 1 year of age: a retrospective reviews of 22 cases in an 11-year period (1977-1987). Congenital brain tumors have been reported infrequently and their management remains ill defined. An 11-year review (1977-1987) of all children with brain tumors with the onset of symptoms before 1 year of age was completed. Twenty-two children with the following histological diagnoses were treated: astrocytoma (7 patients), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (6 patients), papilloma or carcinoma of the choroid plexus (3 patients), malignant teratoma (2 patients), dermoid tumor (2 patients), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient), and chloroma (1 patient). Fifteen tumors were supratentorial in location, and 7 were infratentorial. Initial symptoms were hydrocephalus (32%), focal neurological deficit (23%), asymptomatic increase in head circumference (18%), failure to thrive (14%), and seizures (4.5%). The goal of treatment was a radical excision when possible, with primary chemotherapy in the last 6 years of the review period. Radiation therapy was the adjunct to surgery in the initial 5-year period. All patients with papillomas of the choroid plexus and dermoid lesions underwent a total resection with no recurrence. All 7 astrocytomas were supratentorial, with 6 occurring in the diencephalon. Five of the seven patients with astrocytomas survived more than 5 years. The 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors were located equally between the supra- and infratentorial spaces. Four of the 6 infants with these tumors received chemotherapy (2 received chemotherapy alone; 2 received chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and are tumor free 2 to 9 years later. A fifth child received radiation therapy alone early in the series and survived only 4 months. The family of the other child refused adjunctive treatment. 
Caring for older patients with high blood pressure. Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is common in older patients. Optimal selection of antihypertensive therapy in the elderly requires consideration of the unique risks, physiology and concomitant illnesses in this age group. Since the U.S. population is aging rapidly, appropriate management of hypertension in older patients is likely to remain an important concern. 
Current role of digitalis therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Digitalis has been used in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure for 215 years. In this article, numerous clinical studies and trials that have evaluated the efficacy of digitalis in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure are reviewed. The data indicate that digitalis is a valuable therapeutic agent for relieving symptoms and improving exercise performance and left ventricular function in patients with congestive heart failure. Comparison of the various advantages and disadvantages of digitalis with alternative therapies in patients with congestive heart failure shows an important continuing role for digitalis therapy. 
Persistence of symptoms after gall bladder clearance with cholecystolithotripsy. Forty six patients rendered stone and fragment free with successful cholecystolithotripsy without the use of oral chemolitholysis were followed by serial ultrasound for a period of two to 25 months (mean 11 months, median 10 months). Seven patients (15%), six of whom remain asymptomatic, developed recurrent calculi. Of the 39 gall stone free patients, 26 were asymptomatic. Six patients complained of persistent abdominal pain similar to that before treatment. One of these had a bile duct stone. Seven patients complained of a variety of non-biliary symptoms. The patient with recurrent gall stones and recurrent symptoms is eligible for further lithotripsy treatment. The overall 30% incidence of persistent abdominal symptoms is similar to that reported after elective cholecystectomy. 
Relevance of common tests of cerebrospinal fluid in screening for bacterial meningitis. This study tests the hypothesis that if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a nucleated blood cell count (NucBC) of less than 6/mm3, CSF tests other than bacterial culture need not be performed to exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients not receiving antimicrobial agents. The results of tests performed on the first specimen of CSF obtained for a given hospital visit from children younger than 3 years of age, exclusive of newborn infants admitted to the hospital on their date of birth, were analyzed. Of 3356 CSF specimens evaluated, 122 were from patients with bacterial meningitis; 460 specimens were analyzed separately because the erythrocyte count was greater than 1000/mm3. A negative CSF screening test result was defined as a CSF NucBC less than 6/mm3. In facilitating the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, this screening test had a sensitivity of 98.4%, a specificity of 75.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The other CSF tests varied widely in screening effectiveness: a Gram-stained smear had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the screening relevance of CSF tests. The CSF NucBC and CSF segmented NucBC performed indistinguishably and superiorly compared with the CSF protein or glucose concentration and the ratio of CSF glucose to serum glucose concentration. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NucBC alone is superior to any combination of the other CSF tests. In a prospective study of 215 children younger than 3 years of age undergoing a lumbar puncture in our emergency department, 85% had empiric criteria identifying them as appropriate for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. The CSF NucBC was less than 6/mm3 in 70% of the 181 patients who would have been eligible for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. These data suggest that a strategy for the sequential testing of CSF could be adopted that would exclude unnecessary determinations and thereby save time, effort, and health care dollars. 
Influence of local recurrence on survival: a controversy reviewed from the perspective of soft tissue sarcoma. The relationship between local recurrence and survival has been examined using the example of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Studies that appear to indicate that local recurrence does not jeopardize survival are shown to have been inappropriately analysed, to have inadequate patient numbers, or both. A survival deficit due to local tumour recurrence cannot be excluded on present data, and clinical decisions regarding conservative versus radical surgery will therefore continue to involve an element of value judgement. 
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with infantile spasms in five mentally retarded children: a morphological analysis on mesangiolysis. We report five cases of nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in mentally retarded children with severe infantile spasms. Four of the five children diagnosed as West syndrome, Lennox syndrome, or petit mal epilepsy also had cerebral palsy and microcephaly. The other patient had petit mal epilepsy without cerebral palsy and microcephaly. All patients first developed infantile spasms, with the time of onset ranging from 1 week to 2 years of age, and subsequently developed proteinuria, followed by the nephrotic syndrome at 3 to 14 years of age. Four of the five developed terminal renal failure between 7 and 11 years of age. Three subsequently died, but the other underwent kidney transplantation and is still living without further complications. The light, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies performed on the renal biopsies from all the patients and on the autopsy specimens from two cases exhibited FSGS-like lesions. Besides segmental hyalinosis, differing degrees of mesangiolysis were seen, which sometimes developed into dissecting microaneurysms of the glomerular capillary loops. The clinical picture described can be differentiated from congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) or infantile nephrotic syndrome (INS) with respect to the age of onset, outcome, and morphological appearance. We reviewed the previous literature and extended earlier observations about an unusual association between the nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS-like lesion, mental retardation, infantile spasms, and/or microcephaly in children. 
Timing for implantation and transplantation in mechanical bridge to transplantation. The implantation of a mechanical blood pump in a deteriorating candidate for heart transplantation is indicated in general if the cardiac index is less than 1.9 L/min/m2 despite maximal inotropic support. Deterioration of end organ function may be taken as a second factor indicating the need for mechanical support as patients with acute onset of shock may react differently from patients with chronic deterioration. Preoperative need for dialysis largely reduces the chances of long-term survival. The time on support should be long enough to normalize or at least improve secondarily damaged organ systems, but with time infectious and thromboembolic complications will increase. So optimal periods for artificial heart support range between two days and four weeks. Age less than 40 years is a positive predictor for outcome in TAH bridging. The general guidelines, however, do not preclude a favourable outcome in complicated cases, as we show in our own series. 
Survivorship analysis of the uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Sep;73(8):1274] Ninety-six patients who had a total of 108 replacements with an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee prosthesis were followed for an average of sixty-four months (range, thirty-nine to ninety-three months). At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-one implants (19 per cent) had failed, all due to problems with the tibial component. A patellar component was not used, and no noteworthy patellar problems were encountered after the operation. There were no infections about the prostheses, and no femoral implant was revised. The most common cause of failure was collapse of the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which occurred in fourteen knees. The prosthesis loosened without collapse of bone in two knees, and five knees were revised because of gross wear of the polyethylene. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which revision of the prosthesis was recommended, the cumulative rate of survival was 84 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, +/- 7 per cent) at five years and 77 +/- 10 per cent at six years. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which the knee replacement was actually done, the five-year rate of survival was the same. No significant differences were demonstrated between groups that were stratified by age, sex, weight, or primary diagnosis. We therefore do not recommend the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement of the design that was evaluated in this study. 
Inactivation of the Zfx gene on the mouse X chromosome [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Jul 1;88(13):5937] ZFX, an X chromosome-linked gene encoding a zinc-finger protein, has previously been shown to escape X inactivation in humans. Here we report studies of the inactivation status of the homolog, Zfx, on the mouse X chromosome. We took advantage of both the preferential inactivation of the normal X chromosome in females carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation and the high degree of nucleotide sequence variation between the laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and Mus spretus genomes. An EcoRV restriction fragment difference between laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and M. spretus was detected after amplification of Zfx transcripts using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using this allelic variation, we assessed expression of the two Zfx genes in females carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation (from laboratory strain of mouse [corrected]) and an intact X chromosome (from M. spretus). Such females exhibit Zfx transcription from the active laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] chromosome but not from the inactive M. spretus chromosome. These results indicate that the mouse Zfx gene is subject to X inactivation. 
Polymerase chain reaction identification of human papillomavirus DNA in CO2 laser plume from recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was identified in the plume produced during CO2 laser vaporization of respiratory tract papillomata. The plume produced from CO2 vaporization was collected on Gelfoam pledgets that were affixed to suction tips evacuating the vapor plume from the operative field. The Gelfoam pledgets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, processed, and examined for HPV-6 and HPV-11 DNA by a polymerase chain reaction technique. Tissue and vapor-plume specimens were collected from 22 patients undergoing CO2 laser excision of laryngeal lesions. Seven patients had adult-onset recurrent respiratory laryngeal papillomatosis (RRP), 12 had juvenile-onset RRP, two had laryngeal carcinoma, and one had nonspecific laryngitis. HPV-6 or HPV-11 was identified in 17 of 27 vapor-plume specimens from RRP and in none of three from non-RRP lesions. All but one RRP tissue specimen contained HPV-DNA, and none of the non-RRP tissues contained HPV-DNA. When HPV was present in vapor, the same HPV type was found in the corresponding tissue specimen. Identification of HPV-DNA in the laser plume raises concern regarding potential risks from exposure to the plume--particularly to the endoscopic surgeon and the operating team. The practical concerns and effectiveness of the plume scavenging systems are discussed. 
Race and the self-reported health of elderly persons. This research examined race differences in the structure and measurement of six self-reports of health that are widely used in studies of elderly persons. Second-order confirmatory factor analyses (LISREL) revealed race differences only in the validity of subjective interpretations of health state and in the measurement error of a chronic conditions indicator. No race differences were found in the form of the four-factor model of self-reported health. Results, interpreted within a cognitive illness-labeling framework, have implications for future race-comparative health research. 
Peritonitis due to Rhizopus in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 61-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed peritonitis due to infection with Rhizopus as a complication of receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the onset of infection, the patient was neither acidemic nor hyperglycemic; in addition, deferoxamine had not been administered and Elastoplast dressings had not been applied. The infection occurred after the technique for disinfection of the catheter used for CAPD had been changed. The catheter was removed, and therapy with amphotericin B was initiated. Although the patient died of apparently unrelated causes, an autopsy revealed active fungal infection with multiple abscesses and superficial invasion of the ileal wall. 
A case for early surgery in native left-sided endocarditis complicated by heart failure: results in 203 patients From January 1982 to December 1988, 203 consecutive patients were selected for early valve replacement (mean 10 days from time of admission) if they had clinical evidence of native valve endocarditis with 1) vegetations on echocardiography, 2) severe valvular lesions, and 3) heart failure. Surgery was performed within 7 days of admission in 56% of patients and was done urgently because of hemodynamic deterioration in 108 (53%). All vegetations were identified by echocardiography and confirmed macroscopically at surgery. One hundred ten patients had isolated aortic valve infection, 50 had isolated mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05 for aortic vs. mitral) and 43 had double-valve infection. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57, 38 and 67 min, respectively. Sixty-four patients (32%) had extensive infection involving the anulus or adjacent tissues, or both; such infection more frequently involved the aortic than the mitral valve (p less than 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (35%) with aortic valve infection had abscess formation compared with 1 patient (2%) with mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05). Only eight patients (4%) died in the hospital. There were seven patients (3%) with a periprosthetic leak and five patients (3%) with early prosthetic valve endocarditis. Long-term follow-up, available in 174 hospital survivors (89%), revealed 10 deaths and two new ring leaks at 38 +/- 22 months. In conclusion, among patients with endocarditis who need surgery for heart failure, aortic valve infection is more prevalent than mitral valve infection and is more often associated with extensive infection, including abscess formation. 
Human immunodeficiency virus-related lymphomas: a possible association between tumor proliferation, lack of ploidy anomalies, and immune deficiency In an attempt to identify a biologic basis for the aggressive clinical behavior of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphomas (HAL), dual-parameter flow-cytometric analysis was performed on 22 paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. Cases were analyzed for DNA ploidy, the percentage of cells in S-phase (proliferative activity), and content of a recently identified proliferation-associated nuclear antigen, p105. The DNA-content analysis of 22 HALs was compared with that of 109 cases of intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) unrelated to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) studied previously in our laboratory and 125 cases of high-grade NHL reported in the literature. The proliferative activity was higher in intermediate-grade HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL (24.0% v 10.4%; P = .03), and in high-grade HAL in comparison with NHLs of similar histology unassociated with HIV infection (24.8% v 19%), although the latter did not reach statistical significance. The number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields was found to correlate with the percentage of cells in S-phase (r = .68; P = .0004). Although p105 content tended to be higher in HAL than in an AIDS-related complex (ARC)-associated hyperplastic lymph node control, no statistically significant associations were found between p105 content and proliferative activity or the number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields. When compared with non-AIDS NHLs of comparable grade, there was a trend toward a lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy in both intermediate- (25% v 56%) and high-grade (38.5% v 60%) HALs. The higher proliferative activity and lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy found in HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL of comparable histologic grade may represent differences in pathogenesis and may underlie the poor prognosis of HIV-associated NHL. 
Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and heat-shock 27-kD protein in liver biopsy specimens from patients with hepatitis B virus infection. It has been proposed that in the human liver, the estrogen receptor gene may become inappropriately expressed as a consequence of HBV integration, contributing to cell transformation. This study was undertaken to examine estrogen receptor status in patients with hepatitis B virus infection and to analyze the expression of progesterone receptor and of a heat-shock 27,000-D protein (hsp27), both of which are estrogen regulated in estrogen target tissues. Receptor proteins were detected in liver biopsy specimens by immunocytochemistry using antireceptor monoclonal antibodies; a monoclonal antibody was also used to detect hsp27. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were mainly seen in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The presence of hepatitis B virus infection did not always result in elevated estrogen receptor expression, but in general the expression of this receptor protein was higher in hepatitis B virus-positive patients than in patients with the same pathological findings (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma) but without hepatitis B virus. This was more clearly seen in the patients with hepatitis. Although estrogen receptor expression was moderate to high in many samples, the expression of the two biochemical markers of estrogen action at postreceptor levels (progesterone receptor and hsp27) was low or absent in most of the liver tissues examined, suggesting that in the liver the interaction of estrogen-estrogen receptor-DNA has characteristics inherent to this tissue. 
Perspectives on human response to health and illness. Nursing's domain has been defined as the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health problems, yet debate rages over what "human responses" are. Without clear meanings for this and other terms used in nursing, the profession cannot claim that its practice is scientifically based, nor can it share that base among disciplines. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in children after selective dorsal root rhizotomy. The authors report their experience with low doses (0.007-0.015 mg/kg), moderate doses (0.016-0.025 mg/kg), and high doses (0.026-0.035 mg/kg) of intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia after selective dorsal root rhizotomy surgery in 50 children, aged 3 to 12 years. After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
The pharmacology of stuttering: a critical review. OBJECTIVE: The author critically examines the limited world literature on pharmacologic treatments of stuttering. METHOD: The literature on stuttering and drugs was identified by means of two computer-assisted searches. FINDINGS: A great variety of pharmacologic agents have been used to treat stuttering, reflecting the many theories about the origin and nature of the disorder. In some instances new hypotheses about the nature of stuttering have followed the chance discovery of agents having some efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have used adequate experimental designs. Promising avenues of research, both for the treatment of stuttering and for exploring its nature, include the use of calcium channel blocking agents and cholinergic drugs. 
Management of ventricular septal defect with associated aortic incompetence. Twenty-two patients with a ventricular septal defect and aortic incompetence underwent surgical repair. Mean age was 9.6 years (range, 9 to 15 years). Mean follow-up was 32.4 +/- 15.8 months. The ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 19 patients and doubly committed or juxtaarterial in 3. Most showed only a small left-to-right shunt. Mean diameter was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mm. Aortic incompetence was mild in 6 patients, moderate in 4, and severe in 12. In 16 patients closure of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valvoplasty were both performed through the aortic root. There were no deaths. All patients retained normal sinus rhythm. No complete heart block was found. In 3 patients secondary aortic valve replacement was required for severe incompetence; in 1 the cause was bacterial endocarditis, in another technical failure, and in a third progressive incompetence over an 8-month period. All patients showed substantial clinical improvement, marked decrease or disappearance of the valvar incompetence, diminution of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased cardiothoracic ratio. We conclude that primary repair is the operation of choice for this combination of lesions. This can avoid or delay considerably valvar replacement. The left-sided approach proves safe and is our preferred technique. 
Characterization of childhood acute leukemia with multiple myeloid and lymphoid markers at diagnosis and at relapse. To define the clinical and biologic significance of childhood acute mixed-lineage leukemia diagnosed by stringent criteria, we studied 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 myeloid-associated antigens (My+ ALL), and 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 lymphoid associated antigens (Ly+ AML). These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias. 
A new technique for sheathless percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation is helpful for controlling myocardial ischemia and providing hemodynamic support, but its applicability is limited by lower extremity ischemic complications in a significant percentage of patients. We developed a new sheathless technique for percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion which reduces the effective catheter diameter. A pilot study using this new technique resulted in a 10% rate of limb ischemia, without compromise of balloon function. We conclude that this technique may be useful in reducing the incidence of limb ischemia associated with intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. 
A mutation in the tRNA(Leu)(UUR) gene associated with the MELAS subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are usually divided into three distinct clinical subgroups: (1) mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); (2) myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres (MERRF); and (3) chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) including Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Large deletions of human mitochondrial DNA and a transition mutation at the mitochondrial transfer RNALys gene give rise to CPEO including Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MERRF, respectively. Here we report an A-to-G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 3,243 in the dihydrouridine loop of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu)(UUR) that is specific to patients with MELAS. Because this mutation creates an ApaI restriction site, we could perform a simple molecular diagnostic test for the disease. The mutation was present in 26 out of 31 independent MELAS patients and 1 out of 29 CPEO patients, but absent in the 5 MERRF and 50 controls tested. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the mutant DNA always coexists with the wild-type DNA (heteroplasmy). 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Effect of altered activation sequence on epicardial QRST area and refractory period in dogs. BACKGROUND. We investigated the effects of activation sequence on cardiac surface QRST areas and refractory periods in experiments on dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Right and left ventricular pacings were performed, and the pacing site was altered every 6 minutes. After 4 minutes of a given pacing, 54 unipolar electrograms distributed over the entire cardiac surface were recorded. Next, refractory periods at electrode sites near pacing electrodes were measured. Paired right ventricular/left ventricular (RV/LV) pacing data were obtained six or seven times in each sample. Although the QRST isoarea maps during the two activation orders were qualitatively similar, it was recognized consistently from the right ventricle-left ventricle difference map that leads around the RV free wall had positive values and that leads around the LV free wall and apex had negative values. Compared with the same leads at RV and LV pacing, QRST areas were larger when pacing sites were near the leads. The local QRST areas of individual leads at which we measured local refractory period were consistently larger during drive from proximal pacing sites than during drive from distant pacing sites. Refractory periods were consistently longer during proximal pacing than during distal pacing, and there was a positive correlation between change in local QRST area and change in refractory period (r = 0.64) during altered activation sequence, whereas there was an inverse correlation between change in QRST area and change in refractory period (r = -0.91) during localized myocardial warming. CONCLUSIONS. Both local QRST areas and local refractory periods were dependent on the activation sequence, and there was a positive correlation between QRST areas and refractory periods during various activation sequences compared with localized myocardial warming. 
Dramatic response of follicular thyroid carcinoma with superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal obstruction to external-beam radiotherapy. We report a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma progressing to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and tracheal obstruction despite multiple doses of radioactive iodine therapy but subsequently responding dramatically to external-beam radiotherapy (RT). Although RT is not considered to be the treatment of choice for follicular carcinoma, RT in our patient produced unequivocal improvement of SVC syndrome and tracheal obstruction. 
Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. 
Assessment of the human coronary circulation using a Doppler catheter. Arteriographic estimates of stenosis severity can fail to reflect the impact of an individual stenosis on delivery of blood to the myocardium. Whether a coronary stenosis is truly flow-limiting can be determined by measuring hyperemic blood flow or coronary flow reserve; however, until recently, the tools needed to measure coronary flow reserve in humans--namely, a method of quantitating coronary blood flow in individual arteries and another method for producing maximal microvascular vasodilation--were not available. Over the last 8 years, our laboratory group has developed a catheter for measuring coronary blood flow velocity in humans, using the Doppler principle, and studied the effects of microvascular vasodilators. These studies have enabled us to measure coronary flow reserve in humans and to characterize some of the effects of focal and diffuse atherosclerosis on the coronary circulation. In addition, we have used flow reserve measurements in the diagnosis of microvascular dysfunction in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries and as a means of assessing noninvasive methods for detecting focal coronary artery disease. 
Phenotypic heterogeneity in the syndromes of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Combined 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric aciduria, one of the more common urinary organic acid abnormalities, has been observed in at least three clinical syndromes. We studied an additional seven patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, four of whom were best categorized as having the type II syndrome, two as having an "unspecified" syndrome, and one who may have had a primary urea cycle defect. In cultured cells and autopsy tissues derived from patients with the type II and unspecified syndromes, we were unsuccessful in identifying a defect in the leucine degradative pathway distal to 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase. Further assessment of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in several patients with one of the two types of disease also provided no defined abnormality. The primary metabolic defects in the type II and unspecified syndromes remain undefined. 
Outpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience. As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique. Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large. One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site. Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension. Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate. It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary. 
Clinical anatomic study of pure dysarthria. Nine patients with pure dysarthria underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients had infarcts of lacunar or larger size in the internal capsule: four in the superior portion of the anterior limb or adjacent corona radiata and four in the superior portion of the genu or the adjacent corona radiata. In one patient, there was a small infarct in the bulbar motor cortex. Dysarthria was transient and characterized by poor articulation in all cases. Five patients also had contralateral facial weakness, and three patients with lesions in the genu had minimal and transient involvement of the contralateral fingers. These three cases appeared to be variants of the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. We submit that this syndrome should sometimes be regarded as a stroke syndrome rather than always as a lacunar syndrome. 
Cervicomedullary junction decompression in a case of Marshall-Smith syndrome. Case report. The case is reported of a 2-year-old boy born with Marshall-Smith syndrome who had difficulty in swallowing and who exhibited spasticity and quadriparesis due to compression of the medulla and cervical spine. This is the first child with this rare condition reported to have brain-stem compression from bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction and who has required surgery. 
Effect of intrathecal fibrinolytic therapy on clot lysis and vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (CT) findings after surgery. The patients included fulfilled the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the hemorrhage, CT showed only blood in the basal cisterns, and the patient had a single aneurysm or multiple aneurysms that could be treated surgically at the same operation. The patients were divided into groups of 10, with patients receiving 3, 10, or 13 mg of rt-PA in a single intracisternal injection at the end of the operation. There were no differences between the treatment groups in overall outcome. One patient from the 3-mg rt-PA group developed a postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, and one patient from the 10-mg rt-PA group had a postoperative epidural hematoma. There was one death in the 13-mg rt-PA group that was caused by inclusion of a segment of pericallosal artery in the clip. In all treatment groups a reduction was observed in the amount of blood seen on the postoperative CT scans compared to the preoperative CT scans. The reduction in SAH grade between the 10-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in the severity of angiographic vasospasm between the 3-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was also significant (p less than 0.05). 
Efficacy and safety of a perioperative enoxaparin regimen in total hip replacement under various anesthesias. Four trials in which enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, was used in patients having hip surgery are reported. In the first two trials, enoxaparin was given before general anesthesia. The protocol consisted of 40 mg of enoxaparin, 4,000 anti-factor Xa IU, subcutaneously 12 hours before surgery, followed by the same dose 12 hours after surgery and then once daily. In the third trial, this protocol was compared with unfractionated heparin calcium given in a standardized manner and appeared to be significantly superior both in efficacy and tolerance. In the fourth trial, the protocol was adapted for use in spinal subarachnoidal anesthesia; 20 mg of enoxaparin, 2,000 anti-factor Xa IU, was given subcutaneously 1 hour after anesthesia and 40 mg 12 hours later. In all these trials tolerance was good. Excessive bleeding did not occur with the 40 mg once daily regimen. Efficacy was good and compared favorably with other protocols in use. 
Calcium channel blockers. Potential medical benefits and side effects. Calcium channel blockers are recently developed antihypertensive drugs. In terms of mechanisms of action, their specificity is not so well established as that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but is better understood than that for diuretics or adrenergic-inhibiting drugs. Calcium channel blockers were originally developed for treatment of angina but were found to lower arterial pressure as well. Three of them are now in wide use in the United States; their therapeutic spectrum in regard to type of hypertension is broad. Sublingual nifedipine has replaced intravenously administered vasodilators as immediate treatment of severe hypertension, and all three drugs, given orally, have been shown to be effective in mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. The three drugs available in this country are verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. Pharmacological studies have shown that verapamil has the most negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of the three, with nifedipine producing the most vasodilation and having the potential for causing reflex tachycardia. Actually in practice, these various pharmacological differences have proved to have less significance than previously thought, and the drugs seem to have about equal antihypertensive effectiveness. Comparisons of calcium entry blockers with other drugs have shown them to be equally effective in whites as propranolol but more effective in blacks. Responsiveness appears to be related, as well, to pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Thus, the antihypertensive effect is directly related to age and inversely related to plasma renin activity. The side effects mostly relate to vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and edema; they are not frequent, and the drugs are well tolerated. 
Influence of phlebographic abnormalities on the natural history of venous ulceration. Eighty-five limbs in 73 patients with a healed venous ulcer were assessed by ascending and descending phlebography, foot volume plethysmography and transcutaneous oxygen measurements. Forty-four limbs had post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. In 24 (28 per cent) these extended into the femoral vein, while in 20 (24 per cent) only the calf veins were involved. In the 41 limbs (48 per cent) with normal deep veins on ascending phlebography, 11 had evidence of localized incompetence of the calf communicating veins, 14 had either long saphenous incompetence, deep vein reflux to the level of the knee or below, or both of these abnormalities, and 16 limbs had no phlebographic abnormalities. However all limbs had a decreased half volume refilling time on foot volume plethysmography. Limbs with post-thrombotic changes extending into the femoral vein were associated with a significantly longer history of ulceration and more ulcer recurrences than limbs with calf vein damage (P less than 0.05 for each) and limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01 for each). However, these limbs did not have lower transcutaneous oxygen ratios or longer times to achieve ulcer healing. Ascending phlebography identified a group of limbs with extensive post-thrombotic changes in which there was a higher incidence of ulcer breakdown, but this was not associated with a delay in ulcer healing. 
Bradycardic responses to vagally mediated bedside maneuvers in healthy volunteers. PURPOSE: To determine the relative potency in healthy individuals of the vagally mediated reflexes used clinically to inhibit sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease performed face immersion in cold water and the Valsalva maneuver twice, to maximum endurance and to the subjective point of first discomfort, and face immersion in warm water and the Muller maneuver to maximum endurance only. Right and left carotid massage and left, right, and bilateral eyeball compression were each performed for 15 seconds. Change in heart rate was taken as baseline minus the rate over the slowest three consecutive QRS cycles elicited by each maneuver. Fisher's least-significant-difference multiple comparison procedure was used to analyze heart rate responses. Significance was defined as p less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: Maximum pulse decrements from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in beats/minute were as follows: cold-water face immersion to maximum endurance 15.5 (12.3 to 18.5), cold-water face immersion to first discomfort 10.1 (6.7 to 13.1), Valsalva maneuver to maximum endurance 9.2 (6.3 to 12.4), Valsalva maneuver to first discomfort 8.3 (5.0 to 11.3), right carotid massage 7.3 (4.3 to 10.3), left carotid massage 5.2 (2.3 to 8.4), right eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), left eyeball compression 6.6 (3.6 to 9.5), bilateral eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), warm-water face immersion 7.0 (3.2 to 9.8), and Muller maneuver 1.6 (-1.3 to 4.9). Bradycardia was significantly greater for cold-water immersion of the face performed to maximum endurance than for all other maneuvers. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the diving reflex is the most potent of the vagally mediated reflexes utilized in clinical practice. Immersion of the face in cold water may prove effective at the bedside when other maneuvers fail to augment vagal tone adequately. 
Liver enzyme abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. If toxicant exposure contributes to the cause of Parkinson's disease, poor function of detoxifying enzymes could increase vulnerability for Parkinson's disease. Although no hepatic enzyme system has been shown universally to be dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease patients, several have been suggested to be dysfunctional in subgroups, such as those with young age at disease onset. Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase. If hepatic enzyme abnormalities contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease, molecular genetic techniques may allow the development of screening tests to identify at-risk subjects in order to intervene with protective therapies. 
Diagnosis and treatment of headache in the elderly. The diagnosis and management of some causes of headache in the elderly are reviewed. Etiologic theories have been presented for each condition. Treatment modalities include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical therapies. The treatment course set forth in this article can help the clinician provide proper relief for the patient in pain. 
Splenectomy does not correlate with length of survival in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses. The relationship between splenectomy and survival time after curative total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer was examined by reviewing retrospectively data on 252 patients treated in our clinics between 1965 and 1985. One hundred three patients (40.9%) did not undergo splenectomy and 149 (59.1%) did. In patients subjected to splenectomy, advanced stages of the malignancy were more frequent and metastasis was noticed in 8.1% of splenic hilar lymph nodes and in 10.1% of the lymph nodes associated with the splenic artery. A univariate analysis revealed that the survival time of patients with splenectomy was significantly less than those for whom splenectomy was not done (P less than 0.05). In a subgroup of our patients stratified to adjust for the stage of disease, there was no significant difference between the survival rates. Subsequently, multivariate analysis using the Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other covariates indicated that serosa invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size were the most important prognostic factors, and there was no correlation whatever with splenectomy. Our findings rule out any relationship between splenectomy and length of survival time in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. 
Preservation of hearing in neurofibromatosis 2. Preservation of hearing in the neurofibromatosis 2 (central neurofibromatosis) patient has been infrequently documented. This goal can be attained in selected patients and should be more frequently accomplished in the future with improved diagnostic capabilities and improved surgical techniques. We report three patients in whom this elusive goal has been accomplished. 
Comparison of exercise testing with studies of coronary flow reserve in patients with microvascular angina. Abnormal small coronary artery function may cause limited coronary flow responses to stress, resulting in anginal symptoms and ischemia in some patients with chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries. To assess the exercise hemodynamic correlates of coronary flow abnormalities measured in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, 105 patients with microvascular angina (defined as an increase in coronary vascular resistance during pacing stress after ergonovine administration in the absence of significant epicardial constriction and associated with provocation of the patient's typical chest pain) and 27 patients without any coronary flow abnormality (normal) were analyzed. Of the 105 patients with microvascular angina, 75 had normal electrocardiographic responses to treadmill exercise testing, 22 had ischemic responses, and eight had bundle branch block during exercise. All 27 normal patients had normal electrocardiographic responses to exercise. Patients with ischemic electrocardiographic responses (0 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01), and those with bundle branch block (-2 +/- 6%, p less than 0.01) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction responses to exercise compared with the normal group, who demonstrated an 8 +/- 6% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography during exercise, and microvascular angina patients with a normal electrocardiographic response to exercise, who demonstrated a 5 +/- 7% increase in ejection fraction. Although the microvascular response to ergonovine was no different among the three microvascular angina exercise groups, the administration of dipyridamole caused less coronary vasodilation in those patients with apparently ischemic or bundle branch block responses to exercise compared with those with normal electrocardiograms during exercise. 
Natriuretic peptides as cardiac hormones in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The ventricle is a major site of synthesis and secretion of brain natriuretic peptide. To study synthesis, storage, and secretion of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the heart, we have measured BNP mRNA and BNP concentrations in the hearts of Wistar-Kyoto rats and also have investigated its secretion from the isolated perfused heart. The atrium expressed the BNP gene at a high level, and a considerable amount of BNP mRNA also was present in the ventricle, which corresponded to approximately 40% of the atrial BNP mRNA concentration. When tissue weight was taken into account, the total content of BNP mRNA in the ventricle was approximately threefold larger than that in the atrium, although the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA content in the ventricle was only 7% of that in the atrium. By contrast, the BNP concentration in the ventricle was 4.07 +/- 0.97 pmol/g, which was less than 1% of that in the atrium (451 +/- 86 pmol/g). The basal secretory rate of BNP from the isolated perfused whole heart was 49.3 +/- 6.1 fmol/min, approximately 60% of which was maintained even after atrial removal, whereas the secretory rate of ANP was reduced to less than 5%. We also studied age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats-stroke prone. The rank order of the BNP mRNA concentration in the hearts of these rats was left ventricle greater than right ventricle greater than right atrium = left atrium, and the total BNP mRNA content and BNP secretory rate in the ventricle were twice as large as in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results demonstrate that BNP is a novel cardiac hormone in rats and is predominantly synthesized in and secreted from the ventricle. This is in striking contrast to ANP, which occurs mainly in the atrium. The results also suggest possible pathophysiological roles of BNP in certain cardiovascular disorders. 
Randomized trial of salbutamol in acute bronchiolitis. To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo. Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions. Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04). There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03). We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis. 
Altered stores of atrial natriuretic peptide in specific brain nuclei of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats. Previous studies from our laboratories have demonstrated a selective increase in stores of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the anterior hypothalamus of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) compared to NaCl-resistant Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls and have suggested that anterior hypothalamic ANP contributes to the pathogenesis of NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S by local inhibition of norepinephrine release. We have also observed blunting of cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflex function in SHR-S compared to WKY. In the current study, ANP stores in 12 brain nuclei thought to participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including locus coeruleus (LC), A1/C1 area (A1/C1), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), medial preoptic nucleus (MPON), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LN), and posterior hypothalamic area (PHA), were compared in 10-week-old male SHR-S and WKY rats following 3 weeks of 1% v 8% NaCl feeding. Individual brain nuclei were obtained by the micropunch technique and ANP content of bilateral brain nuclei from individual rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. ANP content was significantly decreased in NTS and LC and elevated in AHA of SHR-S compared to WKY rats on either diet. Dietary NaCl supplementation was associated with increased ANP content in PVN of both strains. These alterations in ANP content in SHR-S may be related to the reduced release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in AHA and to the presumed central defect in baroreceptor function. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of temporomandibular joint after surgical treatment of internal derangement. Sagittal and coronal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 21 patients who about 2 years earlier had surgery for temporomandibular joint internal derangement. Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints). At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic. Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints. Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints. Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning. Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6). It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule. 
Venous gangrene (phlegmasia caerulea dolens) complicating heart failure from severe mitral stenosis--a case history. Gangrene of the left upper limb was found to complicate severe mitral stenosis presenting with heart failure in a sixty-eight-year-old woman with a documented left atrial thrombus. Arterial obstruction as the cause of gangrene was excluded by Doppler-assisted assessment of the peripheral pulses. Venous gangrene can complicate severe mitral stenosis and must be distinguished from arterial embolization, in which urgent surgical treatment is imperative. 
Manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Meningitis is the most frequent manifestation of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans; pneumonia due to this organism, though less frequently recognized, is also a significant entity. A retrospective review was performed of all patients seen at Duke University Medical Center between January 1981 and July 1989 who were infected with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and C. neoformans. Of 31 patients with these concomitant infections, 12 had cryptococcal pneumonia (10 definite and two presumptive cases). Eleven of these 12 patients had evidence of extrapulmonary cryptococcal disease as well. Chest radiography showed interstitial infiltrates in 11 instances. For ten of the 12 patients, pulmonary cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all five patients who underwent bronchoscopy yielded the organism. Acute-phase mortality from cryptococcosis was 42% among patients with pneumonia. Cryptococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS is probably more common than has previously been recognized and typically presents as interstitial disease that may mimic other opportunistic infections. 
Expression of interleukin-4 receptors on early human B-lineage cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulates multiple stages of the antigen-dependent phase of B-cell development. However, its precise role in regulating B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow is not as well defined. We examined whether surface IgM- normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors (BCP) expressed IL-4 receptors using biotinylated IL-4. Constitutive expression of IL-4 receptors was detected on both normal and leukemic BCP. A higher percentage of normal BCP (82% +/- 15%) expressed IL-4 receptors compared with leukemic BCP (44% +/- 8%). Using mean fluorescent intensity as an indicator of receptor level on the IL-4 receptor positive cells, normal (91 +/- 41) and leukemic (44 +/- 37) BCP expressed comparable numbers of receptors. IL-4 induced the expression of CD23 on 30% of the leukemic BCP cases examined. IL-4 induced CD23 on surface IgM+ fetal bone marrow lymphoid cells but not on the surface IgM- normal BCP, despite the presence of detectable receptors on the surface IgM- cells. IL-4 did not stimulate proliferation of normal BCP, nor could it enhance the effect of recombinant IL-7 or low molecular weight B-cell growth factor. However, IL-4 increased the expression of surface IgM and surface Ig kappa on in vitro differentiated pre-B cells. Our collective results identify no role for IL-4 in the proliferation of normal or leukemic BCP, but identify a role in the enhancement of surface Ig expression during pre-B to B-cell differentiation. 
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone alters the hypothalamic effects of morphine in the rat. Female rats exhibit a generalized refractoriness to opiate stimulation during periods of steroid-induced LH secretion. In the present study we evaluated that role of LHRH in this steroid-induced effect on opiate-responsiveness. Central administration to ovariectomized rats of native LHRH or the LHRH agonist [Des-Gly10]LHRH ethylamide causes a dose-dependent refractoriness to the hypothermic effects of morphine. The potency relationship of these two LHRH agonists in antagonizing morphine's effect was consistent with their potency in inducing LH release. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate and progesterone in a regimen which induces a preovulatory-like LH surge, antagonized morphine-induced hypothermia, and the LHRH antagonist [D-Phe2, Pro3, D-Phe6] LHRH, reversed the effects of the gonadal steroids. These results indicate that the LHRH secretory dynamics associated with the preovulatory surge of LH may serve to modulate opiate responsiveness and thereby could serve to couple behavioral, sensory, and autonomic events with this neuroendocrine response to gonadal steroids. 
Meningioma: the role of a foreign body and irradiation in tumor formation. A case of meningioma is reported. At the age of 18 years, the patient had undergone insertion of a Torkildsen shunt through a posteroparietal burr hole for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a tumor of the pineal region, of which no biopsy had been made. After the hydrocephalus was relieved, he underwent irradiation of the tumor. Thirty years later, he was treated for an intracranial meningioma wrapped around the shunt. The tumor followed the shunt in all of its intracranial course. Microscopy disclosed pieces of the shunt tube within the meningioma. The role of a foreign body and irradiation in the induction of meningiomas is discussed, and a comprehensive review of the literature is presented. 
Epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia: a report of two cases. The simultaneous ipsilateral presence of an epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia has rarely been reported. We present two such cases, one of which is associated with bone formation, and we consider a possible pathogenetic mechanism. 
Latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for elbow extension. The latissimus dorsi mycocutaneous flap has developed a reputation for its versatility in both skin and soft tissue coverage and for restoration of elbow function in both flexion and extension. In a case presented, a large extra-abdominal desmoid was removed along with the entire deltoid and three-quarters of the triceps. The latissimus dorsi was elevated with a large overlying skin island and rotated on its neurovascular pedicle into the defect in the posterior shoulder and upper arm to replace the resected triceps and deltoid muscle, and to provide coverage in this region. 
Intensive therapy for small-cell lung cancer using carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mid-cycle vincristine, and radiotherapy. Forty patients with small-cell lung cancer (31 patients with limited-stage [LS] disease, and nine patients with extensive-stage [ES] disease but of good performance status) have been treated with an intensive therapy composed of carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with vincristine on day 14 of each carboplatin cycle. A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle. The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L. Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery. Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia. Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR). Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months. Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients. The median survival of the total group was 14 months with an actual 2-year survival of 30% and a minimum follow-up of 28 months. 
Program to increase the accessibility of screening mammography--Rhode Island, 1987-1988. The Rhode Island Department of Health's (RIDH) Breast Cancer Screening Program (RIBCSP) was initiated in 1987; it includes a broad promotional effort targeting women and physicians, a strong quality-assurance program, reductions in the cost of the breast cancer screening examination, and a telephone appointment and tracking system for screening examinations and follow-up care. This report describes and summarizes an evaluation of the RIBCSP. 
The interferons. Mechanisms of action and clinical applications. The interferons (IFN) are one of the body's natural defensive responses to such foreign components as microbes, tumors, and antigens. The IFN response begins with the production of the IFN proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma), which then induce the antiviral, antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunomodulatory actions of IFN. Recent advances have led to Food and Drug Administration approval of five clinical indications for IFN. Interferon alfa is approved for hairy-cell leukemia, condyloma acuminatum, Kaposi's sarcoma in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-A, non-B (type C) viral hepatitis. Interferon gamma has properties distinctive from those of IFNs alpha and beta and is approved as an immunomodulatory treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. Promising clinical results with IFNs have also been reported for basal cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, early human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, and laryngeal papillomatosis. Future clinical uses of IFNs may emphasize combination therapy with other cytokines, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hyperthermia, or hormones. 
Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in children. The symptoms, findings, associated conditions, and treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus were studied in 10 girls and one boy. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a benign but chronic condition of the anogenital area of girls and, less frequently, of boys. The characteristic lesions are hypo-pigmented plaques in a figure-of-8 pattern surrounding the vulva and anus and often involving the natal cleft. The affected hypopigmented skin is sharply demarcated from the normal skin. Hemorrhagic, bullous lesions are uncommon. Fissures and ulcers are seen on the labia, between the labia, and on the perineum, anus, and natal cleft in many children and on the glans penis in boys. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus causes painful defecation and anal and vulval bleeding. In two patients, one girl and one boy, anal stenosis due to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and laxative treatment developed. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus mimics sexual abuse and has led to false accusation and investigations. The anogenital lesions cleared in three patients at the ages of 9, 11, and 12 years, but lesions can persist into adulthood. 
Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of headache during withdrawal from drug-induced headache. In a pilot study (5 patients) we investigated the effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan, a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, on headache experienced during the withdrawal period of drug-induced headache. The pilot study indicated that the substance was effective mostly in patients who originally suffered from migraine. In a patient with tension headache the substance was less effective. In a second double-blind study on six migraine patients with severe drug-induced headache, the drug was highly effective in ameliorating headache and autonomic disturbances. Blood flow velocities measured in extracranial parts of internal and external carotid arteries by duplex-sonography and in middle cerebral and basilar arteries by transcranial Doppler showed no changes after administration of sumatriptan or placebo. This result suggests sumatriptan does not act primarily via constriction of the large cerebral arteries. 
Impaired diastolic function and coronary reserve in genetic hypertension. Role of interstitial fibrosis and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with genetic hypertension is accompanied by abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness and impaired coronary reserve. Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve. 
Certified cause of death in children and young adults with cerebral palsy. The status of 732 children suffering from cerebral palsy from the South East Thames region (births from 1970-9) was ascertained at the end of 1989, and copies of death certificates of the 73 children who have died, aged 4 weeks to nearly 16 years, were obtained. Infantile cerebral palsy (ICD Code 343-) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22%) cases. On 28 (38%) certificates there was no mention of any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28%) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented. 
Necrotizing myopathy with pipestem capillaries, microvascular deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), and minimal cellular infiltration. Three adult patients, two with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and one with carcinoma, had a distinctive pathologic reaction pattern consisting of necrotizing myopathy, minimal cellular infiltration, and a microangiopathy with thick "pipestem" vessels and microvascular deposits of complement membrane attack complex. Quantitative analysis revealed focal capillary depletion. This pattern represents an immune-mediated microangiopathy and is distinct from that observed in other inflammatory myopathies. 
Primary intracerebral osteosarcoma. A 64-year-old man was admitted because of a rapidly progressive left side hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan showed a right side intrathalamic mass, partially calcified. Surgical specimen proved to be an osteosarcoma. The patient died 3 days later from an acute myocardial infarct. Autopsy failed to discover any other significant lesion. A review of the literature disclosed that this case might be the second published primary intracerebral osteosarcoma and the first with immunocytochemical analysis. 
Echographic characteristics of ocular toxocariasis. Ocular toxocariasis most commonly presents as one of three distinct clinical syndromes: endophthalmitis, localized posterior granuloma, or peripheral granuloma. Using standardized echography, the authors studied 11 toxocariasis patients presenting with one of these syndromes. Common echographic findings were noted in ten of these patients, and included: (1) a solid, high-reflective peripheral mass, (2) a vitreous band or membranes extending between the posterior pole and the mass, and (3) a traction retinal detachment or fold from the posterior pole to the mass. These findings were present in patients presenting with leukocoria or endophthalmitis, as well as in patients in whom the peripheral nematode lesion could be visualized clinically. In combination with the history, clinical examination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), standardized echography may be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ocular toxocariasis in cases of leukocoria in which nematode endophthalmitis is suspected. 
When migraine is more than a headache. Stroke in a young patient. Stroke rarely occurs in a young patient with migraine. Nevertheless, vascular headache can lead to catastrophic neurologic consequences, and severe headache associated with persistent neurologic deficits poses a complex diagnostic problem. 
The perception of angina in diabetes: relation to somatic pain threshold and autonomic function. Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise. Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy. Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold. Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry. The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility. Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold. The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds. In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group. 
Effect of pregnancy and pain on cerebrospinal fluid immunoreactive enkephalins and norepinephrine in healthy humans. Endogenous spinal opioid or noradrenergic system activation may increase pain threshold during pregnancy and following a painful stress. Variation in spinal antinociceptive activity is also postulated to explain in part the large variability in postoperative opioid analgesic requirements. In this study, spinal noradrenergic and opioid activity, as reflected by the CSF concentrations of norepinephrine and immunoreactive enkephalins (total enkephalin-containing peptides), was determined in 58 women prior to surgery. The CSF concentration of these substances did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women. CSF norepinephrine tended to be greater in pregnant women who had experienced painful labor than in those who had not (1240 +/- 300 vs. 570 +/- 160 pmol/l; P = 0.056) and these women self-administered less morphine following cesarean section than those without labor pain (64 +/- 4 vs. 86 +/- 7 mg/24 h; P less than 0.01). However, CSF concentration of norepinephrine or immunoreactive enkephalins did not correlate with postoperative morphine use. These results suggest that spinal immunoreactive enkephalin and noradrenergic activity are not increased during pregnancy. However, pain may activate spinal noradrenergic pathways affecting pain sensation. 
Operative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain. Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone. In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions. 
Sinemet (CR4): an open-label study in moderately severe Parkinson's disease. Almost all patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa and progress steadily, requiring an increased overall dosage with time. Sinemet CR4 offers a theoretically attractive method of achieving gradual sustained release of levodopa over time which may be more physiological to striatal dopamine receptors in the early stages of the disease. This study evaluated 20 patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease who were treated with Sinemet CR4 over a 1-year period. Eleven patients completed the full year on therapy, and nine subjects withdrew. Of the withdrawals, two subjects died from non-Parkinson's disease-related illness, three showed no therapeutic benefit, and four responded well for a minimal 6-month period, but then lost therapeutic benefit and developed more severe dystonias. A higher overall levodopa dosage was required by all patients, and side-effects of levodopa were still present in most patients. However, the nocturnal benefit of this long-acting preparation was observed by all the patients in the study. Slow onset of action of Sinemet CR4 resulted in early-morning immobility. Sinemet CR4 cannot replace standard Sinemet, but appears to be a useful form of adjunct therapy in selected patients. 
A randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiation therapy in stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix. Because of the poor results in stage III B carcinoma of the cervix with standard treatment using radiotherapy alone, we designed a randomized trial to determine whether administration of chemotherapy before pelvic irradiation would improve survival. Between May 1984 and August 1986, 107 patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma were randomly assigned, after stratification by age (less than 50 v greater than 50 years), extent of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral), and lymphangiographic findings (negative v positive) to pelvic radiotherapy (RT; arm A) or three cycles of chemotherapy (CT; bleomycin, vincristine, mitomycin, and cisplatin [BOMP]), followed by the same radiotherapy regimen (CT + RT; arm B). The groups were balanced by age, performance status, extent of parametrial involvement, bulkiness of cervical disease, nodal involvement, and presence of hydronephrosis. Minimal follow-up is 34 months. A complete local response was observed in 32.5% of the patients in arm A and in 47% of the patients in arm B (P = .19). Overall 5-year survival rates were 39% for the RT arm and 23% for the CT + RT approach (P = .02). Toxicity was severe in arm B and included fatal pulmonary toxicity in four patients. Locoregional and distant failures were similar in both groups. We conclude that, despite a satisfactory response rate, neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy adversely affects survival in stage III B cervical cancer and is associated with unacceptable toxicity. 
A new surgical approach to subcortical lesions: balloon inflation and cortical gluing. Technical note. A cortical incision performed with inflation of a balloon to create a channel has been used in an approach to deep lesions with minimal damage to cerebral tissue. The balloon is slipped over a blunt needle and, once in place, is inflated through the needle. Postoperative sealing of the incision with fibrin glue avoids the subdural collection of cerebrospinal fluid such as is sometimes observed when the ventricle is opened during surgery. 
Endoscopic sonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic sonography was used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract of 550 patients referred for evaluation of abnormal findings seen on conventional endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, and CT. This essay illustrates the potential uses and limitations of this technique. Special emphasis has been given to the use of landmarks to facilitate orientation of the transducer in both the esophagus and stomach. Specific examples demonstrate involvement of individual layers of the bowel wall in both benign and malignant processes. It is stressed that this is a combined procedure requiring both an endoscopist and a radiologist. Endoscopic sonography is a valuable new technology with substantial potential in the evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Health implications of obesity. The health risks of obesity increase with its severity and reach significance at a weight greater than 20% above optimal, by using life insurance tables, or at a body mass index greater than 27. Risks include hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in some studies, high total-and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. There is an increased mortality from endometrial cancer in women and from colorectal cancer in men. Chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, sleep apnea, gout, and degenerative joint disease can occur with more severe obesity. The distribution of body fat is directly related to these health risks. Abdominal obesity is more dangerous than gluteal-femoral obesity because the amount of intraabdominal fat seems to determine much of the increased peril; therefore, risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes increase with abdominal obesity, even independently of total fat mass. 
Good-quality semen recovered from a paraplegic man with physostigmine salicylate treatment. A case report. A subcutaneous injection of physostigmine was employed to treat paraplegic anejaculation. The sperm motility was greater than in previously reported studies in which electroejaculation techniques were used for seminal emission. 
Status epilepticus in benign rolandic epilepsy manifesting as anterior operculum syndrome. We report the fourth case of partial status epilepticus (SE) in benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS). The child suffered long-lasting attacks involving the mouth and pharynx, clinically manifest as speech arrest, sialorrhea, and drooling. Both clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were compatible with the diagnosis of BECRS. Only during SE was the clinical picture similar to that observed in the operculum or Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome. SE remission was obtained with the usual antiepileptic drug therapy (diazepam, clobazam, valproate). EEG records showed additional patterns of continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and specific inhibition and blocking of interictal centrotemporal spikes by mouth and/or tongue voluntary movements. 
Bleeding time prolongation and bleeding during infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in dogs: potentiation by aspirin and reversal with aprotinin. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with a bleeding tendency that may be exacerbated by adjunctive antiplatelet agents. The effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) alone or in combination with aspirin on serial measurements of template bleeding time, ex vivo platelet aggregation and coagulation factors and the frequency of bleeding was studied in dogs. During infusion of rt-PA (15, 30 or 60 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min), a dose-related increase in bleeding time was observed. In a randomized blinded study of 25 dogs, the baseline bleeding time (mean +/- SD) was 3.5 +/- 1 min in control animals and 4 +/- 2 min after oral aspirin (15 mg/kg body weight). Infusion of rt-PA (15 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min) prolonged the bleeding time to a maximum of 15 +/- 12 min. In contrast, combined aspirin and rt-PA therapy produced an increase to greater than 30 min during infusion, reverting to 13 +/- 10 min within 2 h after cessation of infusion. Recurrent continuous bleeding from incision sites occurred in one of six dogs given aspirin alone, two of seven given rt-PA alone and all six dogs given both aspirin and rt-PA (p = 0.02). Bleeding time greater than 9 min correlated significantly with bleeding frequency (p less than 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87%. Intravenous bolus injection of aprotinin (20,000 kallikrein inhibitor units/kg body weight) in six dogs given both rt-PA and aspirin produced a decrease in bleeding time from greater than 30 min to 9.5 +/- 9 min and resulted in cessation of bleeding. Thus, bleeding and bleeding time prolongation in this canine model are potentiated by a marked interactive effect of rt-PA and aspirin that is rapidly reversible. Template bleeding times may provide a useful quantitative index for monitoring the bleeding tendency associated with thrombolytic therapy. 
Whole-abdominal irradiation for the management of gastrointestinal and abdominal manifestations of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A patient with a long-standing history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia developed weight loss and ascites secondary to gastric/small bowel infiltration and peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue. Moderate doses of radiation were very effective in controlling her gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast to previous reports, clinical improvement after irradiation was a slow, gradual process, requiring 5 months for complete resolution of the patient's ascites. Hematologic suppression may be profound and careful attention to the rate of change in leukocyte and platelet counts is necessary to avoid severe toxicity. 
Abnormal methylation of the calcitonin gene marks progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The clinical aspects of disease progression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are well established, but the nature of the molecular events responsible is not known. We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML. 
Obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery is not a specific CT finding of carcinoma of the pancreas. Partial or complete obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery on CT is considered so characteristic of pancreatic carcinoma that many consider it diagnostic. However, this finding may be present on CT scans of some treatable tumors. During a 2-year period, we retrospectively collected 10 cases of nonpancreatic tumors that obliterated the fat surrounding the celiac axis and/or superior mesenteric artery. Four patients had metastatic disease, three had lymphoma, two had primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma, and one had a diffuse retroperitoneal endocrine tumor. The scans were analyzed for presence, location, and morphology of the mass and biliary and/or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Of the patients with metastatic disease, three had focal, retropancreatic, periceliac masses without ductal dilatation. One had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas and causing biliary dilatation. Of the patients with lymphoma, two had focal masses in the mesenteric root without ductal dilatation, and one had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process. Of the two patients with primary carcinoma of the small bowel, one had a mesenteric mass without ductal dilatation and the other had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreatic head and obstructing the ducts. The patient with the neuroendocrine tumor had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas without ductal dilatation. Obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery is not a specific CT finding of carcinoma of the pancreas. One cannot rely solely on its presence for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma but should use other important findings such as a focal pancreatic mass and ductal dilatation. 
Combination of cimetidine and alginic acid: an improvement in the treatment of oesophageal reflux disease. Cooperative Oesophageal Group. A new chewable tablet containing cimetidine 200 mg and alginic acid 500 mg, at a dosage of one tablet four times daily, was compared in a 12 week randomised study with the standard dosage of cimetidine (400 mg four times daily) in the management of oesophageal reflux disease. The dose of cimetidine continued unchanged throughout the study but the dose of the combination drugs could be increased after six weeks to two tablets four times a day if response was unsatisfactory. A total of 312 patients had data suitable for analysis. Sixty three per cent of those on the combination tablet completed the study without increasing their dose - that is taking cimetidine equivalent to half the standard dosage used in the control group. The improvement in heartburn symptoms was significantly greater in the combination group than in the group taking full dose cimetidine. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in healing and improvement of the appearances of oesophagitis after 12 weeks, and healing rates were as expected from previous studies. The addition of alginic acid to cimetidine in this fixed combination tablet is an improvement in symptomatic treatment of oesophageal reflux disease. 
Reducing the risk of stroke: identifying patients to refer for carotid endarterectomy. The most common causes of stroke are two diseases of aging: hypertension and atherosclerosis. Therefore, although stroke may occur at any age, the incidence is highest among the elderly population. Noninvasive efforts to reduce the risk of stroke in the elderly include control of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, low-cholesterol dietary habits, and moderate exercise. Routine low-dose aspirin also provides some protective effect. High-risk patients (with asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, TIAs, or prior stroke) should be considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy in the absence of contraindications to surgery. 
Remission of hepatitis B-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with several renal diseases, the most common being membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). The role of concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in affecting the course of the renal involvement is largely unknown. We report the case of a HIV-infected adult male with chronic HBV-associated MGN who had complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome associated with spontaneous seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive to HBeAg-negative. The present case illustrates that HIV infection does not preclude improvement of chronic HBV infection or an associated membranous nephropathy. Such improvement may be dependent on the ability of the host immune system to clear HBeAg. 
Tumor proliferative fraction in solid malignant neoplasms. A comparative study of Ki-67 immunostaining and flow cytometric determinations. Tumor proliferative fraction (TPF) has been shown to correlate with prognosis in some malignancies. A method for its determination that is practical, accurate, and reproducible is still being sought. In this comparative study of techniques, TPF values were determined in mirror-image samples of 126 consecutive solid malignant neoplasms using flow cytometry and immunostaining with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an unknown nuclear antigen expressed during the entire cell proliferation cycle but not in resting cells. The mean TPF values for all cases were 19.5 +/- 15.6% (percentage of tumor cells stained) by Ki-67 (range, 1-86%) and 15.7 +/- 9.6% (S + G2M) by flow cytometry (range, 3-60%), which correlated significantly at r = 0.53 and P = 0.005. The correlation was less strong in tumors with low S-phase values (less than or equal to 10%, r = 0.28) than in tumors with intermediate and high S-phase values (r = 0.66). Ki-67 staining percentages did not correlate with patient age, sex, or tissue origin of the tumor. Ki-67 staining appears comparable to flow cytometry determination of TPF in solid malignancies with intermediate and high S-phase values. In tumors with low S-phase values, Ki-67 immunostaining shows higher TPF values, which perhaps reflect an increase in the proportion of G1-phase cells or dilutional effect of nonneoplastic cells in the tumors with low proliferative fraction. 
Effective thrombolysis without marked plasminemia after bolus intravenous administration of vampire bat salivary plasminogen activator in rabbits BACKGROUND. The use of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombolytic therapy is frequently associated with significant fibrinogenolysis. In contrast, recombinant vampire bat salivary plasminogen activator (Bat-PA) displays strict fibrin specificity, an attribute that could be desirable in a fibrinolytic agent. METHODS AND RESULTS. The efficacy and fibrin selectivity of Bat-PA was evaluated and compared with that of t-PA using a rabbit model of femoral arterial thrombosis. Administration of 8.1, 14, and 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg by bolus intravenous injection restored flow in 50%, 75%, and 80% of the rabbits, respectively. The incidence of reperfusion after bolus intravenous injection of 14 and 42 nmol t-PA/kg was 15% and 78%, respectively. The maximal femoral artery reperfusion flows were equivalent after treatment with 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg or 42 nmol t-PA/kg, but the time to reach maximal flow for Bat-PA was approximately one half that of t-PA. Furthermore, the rapid restoration of flow by 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg, in contrast to equimolar t-PA, was accomplished without fibrinogenolysis and with only small decreases in the plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. Equipotent doses of Bat-PA and t-PA both resulted in approximate 2.5-fold increases in the template bleeding times of aspirin-pretreated rabbits. The clearance of Bat-PA from rabbits exhibited biexponential elimination kinetics; approximately 80% was cleared by the relatively slow beta phase (half-life of 17.1 minutes). Overall, Bat-PA was cleared approximately fourfold slower than t-PA. CONCLUSIONS. Bolus intravenous administration of Bat-PA would facilitate prompt initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and the avoidance of plasminemia could result in fewer and less severe bleeding complications. 
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated, Canadian multicenter trial of topical edoxudine 3.0% cream in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. Canadian Cooperative Study Group. Treatment for recurrent genital herpes using edoxudine 3% cream for 5 days was evaluated in 200 patients in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated trial. Lesion tenderness was predictive of and more sensitive and longer-lasting than the symptom of pain. Among patients receiving placebo, times to crusting (P = .043), cessation of investigator-observed signs (P = .005), lesion-associated signs (P = .02), and groin signs (P = .05) were longer in women. Edoxudine reduced viral shedding in men (mean 2.7 vs. 3.4 days, P = .009) and women (2.0 days vs. 3.5 days, P = .0001). Loss of investigator-observed signs (4.4 vs. 6.2 days, P = .002), investigator-observed lesion tenderness (P = .01), lesion signs (P = .02), groin adenopathy (P = .01), and tenderness (P = .01) occurred earlier in women taking edoxudine. Edoxudine was well-tolerated and reduced several signs of herpes in women. Its clinical role in recurrent genital herpes remains to be fully determined. 
Pathologic fibrosis and matrix connective tissue in the subaortic myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To evaluate scar-type and matrix connective tissue and to assess their role in the diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, surgically resected subaortic myectomy specimens and several autopsy hearts from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. Eighteen specimens were differentially stained by a newly developed method that precisely determines relative collagen content; these tissues were compared with postmortem hypertrophied and normal control subaortic specimens. Quantitation revealed a 72% higher level (36.5 vs. 22.1 micrograms collagen/mg protein) of stainable collagen in the hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in hypertrophied control hearts. The endocardial plaque was quantitated morphometrically, and it constituted only 4.6 +/- 1.7% of the total increased collagen content in the cardiomyopathy specimens. For the matrix studies, the cardiomyopathy specimens were stained by a silver impregnation technique that identifies connective tissue elements not normally visible with routine histologic methods. There was a marked increase in content of all matrix components, both in areas of pathologic scarring and in "normal" zones. Whorls of matrix connective tissue were noted in regions of myocyte whorls, as well as independent of them. Thus, these studies revealed a striking increase of both scar-type and matrix connective tissue in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The extensive scarring and the pronounced interstitial and intercellular matrix connective tissue may contribute to the increased ventricular chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation in this disease. 
Astroviruses as a cause of gastroenteritis in children. BACKGROUND. Infection with astroviruses has been associated with gastroenteritis in children, and serologic surveys indicate that this infection may be frequent. The importance of astroviruses as agents of gastroenteritis has not been shown in a controlled study, however. METHODS. We used monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays to detect astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and rotaviruses in stool samples obtained from age-matched children with and children without gastroenteritis. The samples were obtained in two studies, three years apart, among patients attending an outpatient clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. RESULTS. In the first study, astroviruses were detected in 8.6 percent (96 of 1111) of the children with gastroenteritis and in 2.0 percent (19 of 947) of the children without gastroenteritis. In the second study the rates were 8.6 percent (50 of 580) and 2.1 percent (11 of 512), respectively. For both studies combined, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 2.6 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 0.5 percent of the controls, whereas rotaviruses were detected in 19 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 1.0 percent of the controls. The clinical findings associated with astrovirus infection were similar to those associated with rotavirus infection, except for a trend toward greater dehydration in the children infected with rotaviruses. CONCLUSIONS. These two controlled studies involving a total of 3150 Thai children provide evidence that astroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Astroviruses were found in association with gastroenteritis more frequently than were enteric adenoviruses, and with nearly half the frequency of rotaviruses. 
Lipolytic response to metabolic stress in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure whole-body lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification in critically ill patients. DESIGN: The rates of appearance of glycerol and palmitic acid in blood plasma were measured by infusing stable isotope tracers [2H5]glycerol and [1-13C]palmitic acid, respectively. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. SETTING: Medical ICU of The University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital, a university-based referral center. PATIENTS: Five uninjured critically ill patients. Four patients were hospitalized because of respiratory insufficiency and one because of myocardial infarction. Three patients died during their hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: Metabolic studies were performed in each patient after an overnight (12-hr) fast. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/- SE glycerol and fatty acid rates of appearance were 4.5 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg.min, respectively. The ratio of fatty acid to glycerol rate of appearance was 2.9 +/- 0.5. Resting energy expenditure was 132 +/- 6% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated rate of lipolysis is part of the metabolic response to severe stress, regardless of its etiology. Because the rate of fatty acid release far exceeded energy requirements, fatty acids that were not oxidized as fuel were re-esterified to triglyceride, presumably in the liver. 
Definition and measurement of fatigue. Although fatigue is a key component of the chronic fatigue syndrome, its definition and measurement remain relatively undeveloped. Most research on fatigue has been oriented towards work or performance of tasks and has involved laboratory studies of healthy individuals, while the study of fatigue as encountered in clinical settings has received minimal attention from investigators. This paper recommends that the natural history of chronic fatigue in its various clinical presentations be studied and that standardized assessment tools be used in this process. An investigation of the tools available for the assessment of fatigue yielded single-item, unidimensional, and multidimensional instruments. Additionally, the apparent association between affective illness and the chronic fatigue syndrome is addressed, and the fact that this relationship depends on issues of measurement is explored. 
Five-hour balloon inflation to resolve recurrent reocclusion during coronary angioplasty [published erratum appears in Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn 1991 May;23(1):71] A 63-year-old male presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction with initial clinical reperfusion following thrombolysis. Due to recurrent reocclusion, emergency catheterization was performed, demonstrating a 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery. Angioplasty was complicated by multiple reocclusions, ultimately requiring 5-h autoperfusion balloon inflation to maintain patency. 
Symptomatic treatment versus combination chemotherapy for patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer. In a randomized clinical trial, 87 patients with inoperable, extensive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to receive either combination chemotherapy (cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 200 mg/m2 orally on days 2 and 3) or symptomatic treatment. No statistically significant differences in survival time were found between the two treatment techniques. A major problem in the interpretation of the results was the use of semicurative radiation therapy (3000 to 4200 cGy) to the primary tumor and mediastinum, which was given with symptomatic intent. Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group. 
Acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy. We studied 13 patients with supranuclear lower cranial nerve ("pseudobulbar" or "suprabulbar") palsy of acute onset. While seven patients had had a prior stroke, six patients had no history of stroke. Eight patients experienced a complete bilateral supranuclear lower cranial nerve palsy, which was isolated in five patients and associated with hemiplegia and with hemiparesis in three patients. Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course. 
Cell associated urokinase activity and colonic epithelial cells in health and disease. It is not known if urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is associated with normal colonic epithelial cells. The aims of this study were to determine if normal colonic epithelial cells have uPA activity and whether this is concentrated at the cell membrane. In addition, the contribution of colonic epithelial cell associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of colonic epithelial cells was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of colonic epithelial cells was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5.6 (1.1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5'-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9.8 (3.1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3.8 (0.7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4.4 (1.2) v 5.9 (3.6), n = 9). Thus normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors. 
Formation of the tetraploid intermediate is associated with the development of cells with more than four centrioles in the elastase-simian virus 40 tumor antigen transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Sep 15;88(18):8282] The development of pancreatic cancer in transgenic mice expressing the simian virus 40 tumor antigen placed under controlling regions of the elastase I gene is characterized by the sequential appearance of tetraploid and then multiple aneuploid cell populations. Pancreatic tissues from such transgenic mice were studied between 8 and 32 days of age. Virtually 100% of acinar cell nuclei had immunohistochemically detectable tumor antigen by 18 days. Tetraploid cells were demonstrated by DNA content flow cytometry by 20 days and were associated with the appearance of interphase cells that had 5-11 centrioles per cell in single thin sections of pancreatic tissue examined by electron microscopy. Mitotic cells also were observed that had 5 or more centrioles per cell that were incorporated into the poles of bipolar or at least tripolar spindle apparatuses. These observations indicate that formation of the tetraploid intermediate in the diploid----tetraploid----aneuploid sequence of pancreatic tumor formation in elastase-simian virus 40 tumor antigen transgenic mice is accompanied by the development of cells with 5 or more centrioles that can be incorporated into the poles of abnormal mitotic spindles. We speculate that cells with more than 4 centrioles are predisposed to the formation of multipolar mitoses that may yield daughter cells with chromosomal gains and losses, resulting in the subsequent development of aneuploid tumors. 
Receptor-mediated endocytosis of an extracellular steroid-binding protein (TeBG) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Previous studies suggested that an extracellular steroid-binding protein, testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin (TeBG), can enter a variety of cells. Experiments were conducted to determine whether uptake of TeBG occurs by nonspecific fluid phase endocytosis or via a specific receptor-mediated process. In human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) maintained on serum-free medium, exposure to radiolabeled TeBG resulted in cellular uptake, which reached a plateau by 6 h and could be inhibited 80% by competition with unlabeled TeBG. Uptake was temperature dependent with cell-associated radioactivity at 37 C being 1.6-fold higher than at 4 C. Subsequent exposure of cells to pronase resulted in release of the cell-associated TeBG by 88% and 44% at 4 C and 37 C, respectively. After transfer to media devoid of TeBG, approximately 35% of cell-associated radioactivity was release into the medium at 37 C; it was not possible to distinguish whether this was released from the cell surface or from inside the cell. Investigation of the localization of TeBG-gold complexes by electron microscopy revealed that TeBG first binds to the plasmalemma. Within 15 min label appears in receptosomes, which fuse to form multivesicular endosomes. By 1 h all label is observed in multivesicular endosomes and lysosomes, most of which are in the Golgi zone. Localization of the internalized radioactivity using classical cell fractionation techniques showed it appears in a symmetrical band exhibiting the same buoyant density as the lysosomal marker acid phosphatase. The observations reported here show that: 1) TeBG binds to MCF-7 cells; 2) some of the bound TeBG is taken up via a mechanism with all the characteristics of receptor-mediated endocytosis; and 3) within these cells TeBG is localized in endosomes and lysosomes. 
Physical overdistension converts ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property and regulate ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide production. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is present in adult atria but at very low concentrations in normal adult mammalian ventricles. In the atria, the production of ANP is regulated by physical distension of the atrial wall. The same phenomenon was investigated in the ventricles of rats and men. Cardiac tissues from human ventricular aneurysm (n = 5), spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 30), and rats that had overloaded left ventricles induced by surgery (n = 84) were studied with the methods of light microscopic immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic immunogold staining, and RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. It was found that the levels of ANP gene expression, ANP immunoreactivity, and ANP-containing specific granules in the overburdened ventricles were elevated and their degrees of fluctuation were directly proportional to the force of physical distension applied to the ventricular cardiomyocytes. In rats, ANP mRNA and ANP immunoreactivity returned to the control level seven days after the ventricular overload was surgically released. The changes of ANP and its mRNA in the ventricles were related more closely to the changes of intraventricular pressure than to cardiocytic hypertrophy. In addition, ANP immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Purkinje cells and periarteriolar cardiomyocytes in the ventricles of normotensive rats. In conclusion, physical overstretch of the ventricle wall is likely to be the triggering factor affecting ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property, and also to regulate the production of ventricular ANP, thereby contributing to the control of the blood volume and the blood pressure. 
Vitamin K therapy in severe liver disease. A middle-aged man with parenchymatous liver disease and a decrease in vitamin K-dependent factors was given large doses of intravenous phylloquinone (10 mg/d for 20 days) without improvement in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent factors. During subsequent liver transplantation, he exsanguinated. Although the exact role of over treatment with phylloquinone in this case is unclear, plasma levels of phylloquinone 300 times normal were attained after 5 days of treatment without effect on factors II, VII, IX, and X. Further therapy with vitamin K was unnecessary. 
Dichotic listening failure in dysphoric neuropsychiatric patients who endorse multiple seizure-like symptoms. In the present investigation, the dichotic word listening performance of a sample of 25 dysphoric neuropsychiatric patients who endorsed multiple partial seizure-like symptoms was compared with that of matched samples of normal controls and patients with mood disorders who did not endorse multiple seizure-like symptoms. Eighty percent of the patients who endorsed multiple episodic phenomena failed the dichotic listening task, compared with 8% of normal controls and 28% of patients with typical mood disorders. After treatment with carbamazepine, a subsample of polysymptomatic patients manifested significantly fewer seizure-like symptoms. This clinical improvement was typically associated with markedly improved dichotic listening performance in most cases. The results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that "subclinical" electrophysiological dysfunction may severely disrupt the normal transmission and processing of auditory information. Because it is sensitive to this type of presumed cerebral dysfunction and relatively specific, impaired dichotic listening performance is likely to be a useful clinical marker for this complex neuropsychiatric syndrome. 
Sciatic nerve entrapment in a child. Case report. A child was brought for evaluation of signs of unilateral chronic progressive sciatic nerve dysfunction found to be due to nerve entrapment in the thigh by a fibrovascular band. Sectioning of the band was followed by marked improvement in the nerve function. Compression by a band is a rare but treatable cause of sciatic neuropathy. 
Memory T cells represent the predominant lymphocyte subset in acute and chronic liver inflammation. T cells can be divided into two main phenotypic subpopulations-i.e., the CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) "naive" subset and the CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) "memory" subset. In light of this recent functional reinterpretation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, we reinvestigated the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsy specimens from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. In normal liver, the few scattered mononuclear cells present in portal tracts and in the intralobular parenchyma consisted of both CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) naive and CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells. In inflammatory liver diseases, portal tract and periportal and intralobular areas of inflammation consisted virtually only of CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells, which strongly expressed the CDw29 (4B4) antigen, and the adhesion molecules LFA-1, CD2, LFA-3, CD44 and VLA-4 and the activation marker human leukocyte antigen-DR. These results indicate that activated memory T cells represent the predominant subpopulation of lymphocytes in areas of liver inflammation. Memory T cells strongly express various homing receptors and adhesion molecules, which probably allow them to accumulate at inflammatory sites and to strengthen interaction with target cells. Furthermore, the increased number of memory T cells with enhanced interferon-gamma production in areas of liver inflammation may contribute to the maintenance and up-regulation of immune responses occurring in inflammatory liver diseases. 
Intrauterine applications of the resectoscope. The resectoscope, used for decades in the surgical treatment of the bladder, has important applications for gynecologic procedures as well. The surgeon may either resect intrauterine disease or ablate the endometrium with the use of the resectoscope. Both of these outpatient procedures offer women significant reduction in risk and cost compared with extensive surgical procedures that they replace. The resectoscope delivers surgical energy of equal effect to the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser at a fraction of the cost. Gynecologists who wish to learn this new technique must be familiar with hysteroscopy as well as fluid imbalance problems. 
Leu-22 (L60). A more sensitive marker than UCHL1 for peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly large-cell types. Paraffin-embedded sections of 77 peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) were stained with several monoclonal antibodies, including the preferential T-cell markers Leu-22 (L60[CD43]) and UCHL1 (CD45RO). The staining characteristics of L60 and UCHL1 were compared to determine the value of each in the immunophenotypic analysis of PTCLs. Lineage specificity was evaluated among 39 B-cell lymphomas and 33 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). L60 and/or UCHL1 stained 95% of PTCLs, whereas L60 and UCHL1 alone stained 90% and 69% of cases, respectively. L60 demonstrated significantly greater numbers of immunopositive tumor cells than UCHL1 in 37% of the PTCL cases, principally because of enhanced marking of large, neoplastic cells. UCHL1 was a better marker in only 10% of the PTCL cases. L60 stained 33% of B-cell lymphomas, usually small lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic types. UCHL1 stained only 8% of B-cell lymphomas, all large-cell types. L60 and UCHL1 stained Reed-Sternberg cells and variants in three cases of nodular sclerosing HD. These results suggest that both L60 and UCHL1 are useful markers of PTCLs in routinely processed tissue. L60 is a more sensitive marker of large neoplastic T-cells than UCHL1 but is less lineage-specific. These antibodies are most effective when used as part of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. 
Herniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. The authors present two cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature reveals that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. 
Hemodynamic response with passive neck flexion in brain death. Twelve brain-dead patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology, Osaka University Hospital, from July 1988 to August 1989 were studied. A hemodynamic response elicited by passive neck flexion was observed in 10 of the 12 patients. After passive neck flexion, blood pressure began to rise, and the heart rate increased slightly. Blood pressure peaked about 2 minutes after the initiation of neck flexion and then decreased gradually to the baseline level within a few minutes. These responses were suppressed completely by administration of the ganglion blocker trimethaphan camsilate, which suggests that the efferent pathway of the response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Tissue characterization of an unusual right atrial mass by magnetic resonance imaging. In a 70-year-old man who had angina, exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, and presyncopal symptoms, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography disclosed a large atrial mass that resembled a myxoma. Subsequent evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging identified the mass as an intracardiac lipoma attached to the posterior wall of the right atrium, a diagnosis that was confirmed by surgical intervention. Thus, the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging as an adjunct to echocardiographic evaluation of intracardiac masses was demonstrated. 
Posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst in an adult: case report. We report the case of an adult with a posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst that caused a circumscribed osteolytic skull lesion. Local pain, the only symptom of the lesion, regressed after surgery. Intradiploic leptomeningeal cysts must be distinguished from intradiploic arachnoid cysts, which are of congenital origin. 
Evidence for a new tumor-suppressor gene involved in gastrointestinal malignancies. Inactivation or loss of tumor-suppressor genes is believed to lead to the development or progression of malignancies. To determine whether a tumor-suppressor gene is located on chromosome 8, DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissue of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic specimens, and allele loss was investigated by Southern hybridization techniques with the chromosome 8 probe D8S7. Twenty-five percent of pancreatic carcinomas, 50% of gastric carcinomas, and 50% of colorectal carcinomas were found to have lost an allele on chromosome 8. These findings suggest the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 8, which is involved in colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. Definition of the frequency with which this tumor-suppressor gene is involved in gastrointestinal malignancies will await the study of many patients who are classified as informative and the use of multiple probes for chromosome 8. 
Physical activity and risk of developing colorectal cancer among college alumni. The assessment of physical activity at a single time to evaluate its association with cancer may be limited, since such a measure may not adequately reflect activity over the long term. To overcome this limitation, we studied 17,148 Harvard alumni aged 30-79 years who were followed prospectively for the occurrence of colon cancer (n = 225) and rectal cancer (n = 44) from 1965 through 1988. Physical activity, based on self-reported stair climbing, walking, and sports play, was assessed in either 1962 or 1966 (1962/1966) and again in 1977. The increased activity evaluated using either assessment (1962/1966 or 1977) taken alone was not associated with risk of colon cancer. However, alumni who were highly active (energy expenditure of greater than 2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had half the risk of developing colon cancer relative to those who were inactive (less than 1000 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments (age-adjusted rate ratio = 0.50; 90% confidence interval = 0.27-0.93), whereas those who were moderately active (1000-2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had an age-adjusted rate ratio of 0.52 (90% confidence interval = 0.28-0.94). We conclude that either consistently higher levels of activity are necessary to protect against colon cancer or combining two assessments increased the precision of physical activity measurement. We found no evidence that increased physical activity protected against rectal cancer. 
Clinical diagnosis for metastatic adenocarcinoma of spine of unknown origin. A comparative study. The diagnostic values of the presence of Virchow's node (VN) or rectal shelf (RS) in spinal metastasis from adenocarcinoma of unknown origin were studied prospectively in 60 patients during 1986-1988. These were compared with 14 cases with other malignancies of the spine and 37 controls with nonneoplastic spinal lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study in all malignant cases. The results were analyzed by diagnostic test analysis and McNemar chi 2 testing. This yields 18.3-21.6%, 97.2-100%, and 92.8-100% sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, respectively, for a positive test for VN and RS to differentiate significantly adenocarcinoma from other malignancies and control patients (P less than 0.005). These findings may thus be considered as a simple and economic guide for physicians to determine the proper approach to patients with a spinal lesion suspected to be malignant. 
Combined effect of neonatal sympathectomy and adrenal demedullation on blood pressure and vascular changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Neonatal sympathectomy using a combined treatment with antiserum to nerve growth factor and guanethidine during the first 4 weeks after birth was carried out in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Bilateral adrenal demedullation was performed in 4-week-old sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats. The development of hypertension in SHR was prevented by sympathectomy, but the blood pressure (BP) was still higher than in age-matched WKY rats. Demedullation reduced the BP of sympathectomized SHR to the same level as that of WKY rats. Heart rates of SHR and WKY rats were not affected by the treatments. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that sympathectomy significantly reduced the medial mass in the mesenteric arteries of SHR, mainly through a reduction in the number of smooth muscle cell layers. In sympathectomized SHR, demedullation increased the lumen size of muscular arteries under maximally relaxed conditions, which might explain the further reduction in BP in these animals. Demedullation in sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats caused a decrease in smooth muscle cell layers in the superior mesenteric artery, but the same treatment resulted in a slight increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large and small mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats. Adventitial area was increased in some mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats by sympathectomy, and demedullation caused a further increase in the size of adventitia in WKY rats. Heart weight in SHR was normalized to the level found in WKY rats by sympathectomy and demedullation. We conclude that in sympathectomized SHR, the elevated BP was maintained by the adrenal medulla. 
Virological investigations of acute encephalopathy in India A total of 740 consecutive children aged between 6 months and 12 years who presented with acute encephalopathic illnesses during a three year period were assessed both clinically and by laboratory investigations. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined for the presence of cells or other abnormal substances, and any organisms were cultured. Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable. Japanese encephalitis is an important cause of acute childhood encephalopathy in this region. Clinical features of the illness may be mimicked by several disorders which require specific treatment. Thirty four of the 92 died (37%). 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
An immunochemical and immunohistochemical study of aldolase isozymes in renal cell carcinoma. To assess changes in aldolase isozyme patterns (A, B, and C) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues and to evaluate whether serum aldolase A might be a useful marker for RCC, quantitative analysis by enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemical localization were performed. Concentrations of aldolase A in RCC (7300 +/- 6300 ng./mg. protein n = 26) were significantly higher than those of normal cortex (720 +/- 410 ng./mg. protein, n = 14, p less than 0.01); concentrations of aldolase C in RCC (48.0 +/- 8.0 ng./mg. protein) were also significantly higher than those of normal cortex (8.7 +/- 4.7 ng./mg. protein, p less than 0.01). On the other hand, concentrations of aldolase B in normal cortex were 18,100 +/- 10,100 ng./mg. protein (n = 14), whereas the values in RCC were only 130 +/- 270 ng./mg. protein, a significant lowering (p less than 0.01). Immunohistochemically, aldolases A and C were found localized in all RCC tissues (n = 10); aldolase B was faintly stained in only a few tumor cells of two cases (20%). Levels of serum aldolase A were elevated (greater than 300 ng./ml.) in 30 (75%) of 40 patients with RCC as compared to three (6.3%) of 48 individuals with urogenital benign diseases and in seven (21%) of 34 cases with non-RCC urogenital malignancies. Since it is generally accepted that RCC are derived from renal proximal tubules, these findings indicate that aldolase B, the predominant isozyme in the normal case, changes into aldolases A and C during carcinogenesis and that serum aldolase A could be a new useful biomarker for RCC. 
Uhthoff's symptom in optic neuritis: relationship to magnetic resonance imaging and development of multiple sclerosis. Eighty-one patients with a first attack of isolated optic neuritis, 40 with Uhthoff's symptom (Group 1) and 41 without (Group 2), were studied. All had a neurovisual examination, 74 of 81 patients had the pattern visual evoked potential recorded at rest, and 43 had magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. The pattern visual evoked potential P100 latency was prolonged, Group 1 with a mean of 136 +/- 19 msec. Group 2 with a mean of 131 +/- 19 msec (control subjects, 102 +/- 5 msec; n = 84), and the P100 amplitude was reduced, without significant difference between the groups. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans were present in significantly more patients in Group 1 (p less than 0.025). Treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids had no effect on the evolution or duration of Uhthoff's symptom. Overall, 35 of 81 (43%) patients, followed for a mean of 3.5 years, developed multiple sclerosis. The incidence was significantly greater in Group 1 (p less than 0.01). Uhthoff's symptom also correlated with a higher incidence of recurrent optic neuritis. We conclude that Uhthoff's symptom is a prognostic indicator for the early development of multiple sclerosis. 
An ectopic pregnancy in the upper retroperitoneum following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Thirty-seven days after successful embryo transfer, a chorionic vesicle was recovered from the upper abdominal retroperitoneal space in a patient presenting with an acute life-threatening hemorrhage. This is the first case report of a retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy which, although uncommon, is a potentially fatal complication of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. 
Insulin and glucagon levels in fulminant hepatic failure in man. The behavior of insulin and glucagon and related metabolic substrates was assayed in plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. All 12 subjects were provided the same nutritional support. High levels of insulin and glucagon were present at all times and no difference was observed between surviving patients (four) and those who died (8). Elevated values for branched-chain and aromatic amino acids as well as alanine were present. Statistically significant lower levels of aromatic amino acids and consequently a greater branched chain-aromatic amino acid ratio was found in surviving vs nonsurviving patients. A significantly greater level of alpha-fetoprotein was found in patients who survived as compared to those who died. 
Spinal cord stimulation for chronic, intractable pain: superiority of "multi-channel" devices. Spinal cord stimulation has evolved over the past 20 years into an easily implemented technique, with low morbidity, for the treatment of intractable, chronic pain in properly selected patients. We report our experience with a series of 62 patients implanted between 1983 and 1987, with percutaneous and laminectomy electrodes, and with single- and "multi-channel" (programmable, multi-contact) devices. Fifty had chronic, intractable low back and leg pain ("failed back surgery syndrome," lumbar arachnoid fibrosis), five had spinal cord injuries, and seven "peripheral" pathology or stump pain. Statistical analysis of these and other patient characteristics and technical factors was undertaken to identify predictors of outcome. All patients were interviewed by a disinterested third party at a mean of 2.14 years following implantation. A majority of patients reported at least 50% sustained relief of pain and indicated that they would go through the procedure again for the same result. There was corresponding improvement in ability to perform various everyday activities, and decrease in use of analgesics. Ten of 40 failed back patients who were disabled before the procedure returned to work postoperatively. Superposition of stimulation paresthesias upon a patient's topography of pain was found to be a statistically significant predictor of successful relief of pain, by linear regression methods. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient characteristics and technical factors as predictors of outcome demonstrated significant advantages for female patients, and for patients implanted with "multi-channel" devices. With these devices, electrode geometries with central cathode(s) flanked by rostral and caudal anode(s) were favored disproportionately. Technical improvements in implanted spinal cord stimulation devices, in particular the development of multi-contact percutaneous electrode arrays and supporting programmable electronics, have significantly improved clinical results. 
Primary repair of colon injuries in a developing country. Because there are several specific disadvantages to a colostomy in a developing country, primary repair for colon injury was electively performed. Sixty-one consecutive patients with colon injury were seen between 1978 and 1989 and 57 of these (93 per cent) underwent primary repair. In four a colostomy was constructed. Emergency repair was carried out regardless of site or mode of injury, presence of hypotension or peritoneal contamination. There was one death unrelated to anastomotic complications and one anastomotic leakage. The faecal fistula closed spontaneously in 4 weeks. The wound infection rate was 10 per cent. These data support the emerging view that primary repair of colon injury is the management of choice. 
Reducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. 
Estramustine binding protein in human brain-tumor tissue. Estramustine, an estradiol-17 beta and nornitrogen mustard complex, is used in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. A specific estramustine binding protein (EMBP) is important for its cytotoxic action, and the presence of EMBP has previously been demonstrated in rat and human prostatic cancer tissue. Significant levels of EMBP were detected by radioimmunoassay in human brain-tumor tissue. The EMBP concentrations (expressed as ng/mg protein) in 16 astrocytomas (mean 2.6 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mg) and seven meningiomas (mean 5.1 ng/mg, range 0.3 to 9.3 ng/mg) were significantly higher than that found in four samples of epileptic brain (mean 0.7 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 1 ng/mg) and 18 samples of normal brain (mean 0.5 ng/mg, range 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mg). The uptake, metabolism, and antiproliferative effects of the prostatic anticancer agent estramustine have been previously demonstrated in cultured glioma cells. The presence of EMBP may suggest a selective binding and effectiveness in human brain-tumor tissue. 
The disappearance of the "cold patch" in recovered migraine patients: thermographic findings. In a previous paper we suggested that the vascular cold patch may be a useful prognostic index to followup migraine patients. Considerable criticism against our contention has been raised by Swerdlow and Dieter (Headache 29:562-568, 1989, ref. 1), who claim that the cold patch constitutes a "fixed geography" of the vasculature of migraine patients. In the present paper we replicate and extend our previous findings reporting the results of facial thermography in a sample of 246 consecutive migraine patients. Of these the 206 exhibiting a typical cold patch or a significant asymmetry in the forehead thermal dissipation were admitted to prophylactic treatment (beta blocker or calcium channel blocker). The thermography was performed at entry in the study and after six months of active treatment. The clinical outcome was compared to the thermographic findings. The patients were subdivided in three classes on the basis of the clinical outcome. Among the 136 patients who experienced complete or substantial relief from headache the cold patch disappeared or markedly improved in 85% of the cases. In the 46 patients with partial relief the thermogram showed an improved pattern in 48% of cases, most of the time of smaller extent than in the previous class. In 24 patients we observed no clinical improvement. Among these the thermogram remained unchanged in 85% of cases. Taken together these findings corroborate our previous suggestion that thermography is useful to monitor the clinical course of the disease. One additional suggestion from the present data is that thermography closely parallels the clinical course so as to represent a useful criterion for the decision of discontinuing the therapy. 
Biochemical and molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in Leigh's syndrome. We studied three patients with Leigh's syndrome (LS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. Biochemical studies in brain, muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and fibroblasts disclosed a generalized COX deficiency. Kinetic studies of COX activity in brain mitochondria showed a low Vmax and a normal Km for reduced cytochrome c. Immunologic studies showed decrease of all COX subunits studied, without a specific defect of any one of them. Southern blot analysis excluded large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) but revealed a generalized increase in mtDNA quantity. Although Northern blot analysis showed no alteration in the 12 COX subunit mRNAs studied, two of three patients showed a decreased steady state rate of COX transcription in brain. COX deficiency in LS thus appears to be related to a decreased amount of otherwise normal COX holoenzyme. 
Balloon dilatation of restrictive interatrial communications in congenital heart disease. An adequate interatrial communication is necessary for survival in several forms of congenital heart disease. Three children are presented in whom blade atrial septostomy proved either technically impossible or failed to achieve adequate interatrial communication. In all three an adequate communication was obtained by a balloon dilatation technique similar to that used for pulmonary valve dilatation. In one critically ill infant with mitral atresia the procedure was life saving. 
Effect of enlarged adenoids on arterial blood gases in children. The enlarged adenoid is a common disorder in children resulting in nasopharyngeal obstruction. Many authors suggest that increased nasal resistance to respiration may cause disturbances in the pulmonary ventilation and carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea and/or cardiopulmonary syndrome. This study comprised 30 children complaining of long-standing nasal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids. Adenoidectomy was performed and the arterial blood gases were measured before and one month after surgery. Twelve normal children were also included as controls. Statistical evaluation of the results showed that O2 saturation and arterial O2 tension (PaO2) were significantly low before the operation, and increased significantly after surgery. Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was insignificantly low before operation, but decreased significantly after adenoidectomy. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid may be associated with ventilatory impairment which is reversible after adenoidectomy. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of home parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. A case report. Severe cholestasis associated with long-term home parenteral nutrition is rare, and no treatment is known to be effective. This study shows a case of a patient who developed jaundice while receiving long-term home parenteral nutrition. Causes of jaundice, other than the patient's parenteral feedings, were excluded. The patient's jaundice did not respond to alterations in his parenteral feeding program or to metronidazole. Ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) led to a prompt and sustained improvement in his hyperbilirubinemia. When ursodeoxycholic acid was stopped, the patient again became jaundiced, but this resolved with reinstitution of ursodeoxycholic acid. This case suggests that ursodeoxycholic acid may be an effective treatment for home parenteral nutrition--associated cholestasis and should be evaluated further in patients with cholestasis associated with parenteral feeding. 
Gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda. We report a rare case of gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda that developed in a 49-year-old Japanese man. Early gastric cancer (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was present at the edge of an ulcer in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. In addition, a carcinoid tumor was found adjacent to adenocarcinoma. This tumor displayed ribbonlike or trabecular patterns, and numerous constituent cells were positive for the argyrophil reaction with Grimelius' stain and serotonin. Electron microscopic features of this tumor confirmed typical carcinoid. There was no merged appearance between both tumors, suggesting collision-type tumor. 
Value of planar 201Tl imaging in risk stratification of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction. Although exercise ECG testing has been shown to have important prognostic value after acute myocardial infarction, exercise 201Tl scintigraphy offers several potential advantages, including: 1) increased sensitivity for detecting residual myocardial ischemia; 2) the ability to localize ischemia to a specific area or areas subtended by a specific coronary artery; 3) the ability to identify exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction, which is manifested by increased lung uptake or transient left ventricular dilation; and 4) more reliable risk stratification of individual patients. The more optimal prognostic efficiency of 201Tl scintigraphy partially results from the fact that the error rate in falsely classifying patients as low risk is significantly smaller with 201Tl scintigraphy than with stress ECG. Because of these substantial advantages, there seems to be adequate rationale for recommending exercise perfusion imaging rather than exercise ECG alone as the preferred method for evaluating mortality and morbidity risks after acute myocardial infarction. 
A prospective evaluation of myocardial contusion: correlation of significant arrhythmias and cardiac output with CPK-MB measurements. Over a nine-month period, patients with chest trauma were prospectively evaluated for myocardial contusion. Ninety-two patients with evidence of anterior chest trauma were entered into the study and had 1) an ECG on admission and daily for three days; 2) monitoring of the myocardial band fraction of creatine phosphokinase (CPK-MB) on admission and every eight hours for 24 hours; 3) continuous electrocardiographic Holter monitoring for three to five days; and 4) noninvasive pulsed-Doppler cardiac output measurements daily for three days. Twenty-three patients developed 25 significant arrhythmias (SARRs): 1 atrial fibrillation, 1 AV dissociation, 5 supraventricular tachycardias, and 18 paroxysmal ventricular tachycardias. Cardiac outputs were significantly higher in those patients without SARRs. The CPK-MB levels correlated with the SARRs but were neither sensitive nor specific. No patients required specific therapy and none developed adverse sequelae of the SARRs. We conclude that 1) CPK-MB monitoring should not be routinely used for screening and diagnosis; 2) continuous arrhythmia monitoring deserves further clinical investigation but not routine application; 3) stable patients at risk for myocardial contusion should be monitored for 24 hours; and 4) the Abbreviated Injury Score for "minor" myocardial contusion should be deleted for purposes of ISS tabulation. 
Clipping of an aneurysm 20 years after encasement with methyl methacrylate. Case report. A variety of agents have been used to coat aneurysms as an alternative to clipping. These agents were employed more frequently prior to the routine use of the operating microscope and the presently available variety of aneurysm clips. One such coating agent is methyl methacrylate. This report describes a patient with an anterior communicating aneurysm that rebled 20 years after being encased in methyl methacrylate. At operation, the pulsating aneurysm had eroded the adjacent layer of methyl methacrylate, creating a small intervening space. This space allowed removal under the microscope (with a high-speed air drill and a diamond bit) of the methyl methacrylate from the anterior cerebral arteries and aneurysm, exposing it for definitive clip placement. The feasibility of clipping encased aneurysms is discussed. 
A tRNA(Lys) mutation in the mtDNA is the causal genetic lesion underlying myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) syndrome. Skeletal muscle mtDNA of three patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, characterized clinically by myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) syndrome, has been sequenced to determine the underlying molecular defect(s). An A-to-G substitution of nt 8344 in the tRNA(Lys) gene, a substitution suggested to be associated with MERRF encephalomyopathy, was detected in these patients. Abnormal patterns of mitochondrial translation products were observed in the skeletal muscle of patients, consistent with the expected consequential defect in protein synthesis. The genealogical studies of the three patients, as well as mtDNA from one published MERRF patient and from nine other normal and disease controls, revealed that the tRNA(Lys) mutations in the MERRF patients have arisen independently. These observations provided evidence that the base substitution is a causal mutation for MERRF. 
Screening for dementia and investigating its causes. OBJECTIVE: To examine, from the perspective of primary care physicians, the value of mental status findings and ancillary tests in diagnosing dementia or its causes. DATA SOURCES: Studies identified using MEDLINE and bibliographies of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Selection based on availability of information on specific findings or tests, the criterion standard used to confirm diagnoses, the disease spectrum, and the richness of the reported data. DATA EXTRACTION: Data collected on sensitivity and specificity. In many cases, the originally reported data are re-analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of alternative cut-off values or to answer specific clinical questions. Likelihood ratios estimated to summarize test results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Probability of dementia is greatly reduced (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.2) when either normal serial 7s, 7-digit span, 3-item recall, or clock drawing test results are obtained; abnormal results only moderately increase the odds of disease. Low (less than or equal to 20), intermediate (21 to 25), or high (greater than or equal to 26) scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) increase (likelihood ratio greater than or equal to 8.2), have little effect (likelihood ratio, 1.3 to 2.4), or decrease (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.1) the odds of disease. The usefulness of tests to investigate the cause of dementia varies depending on the pretest probability of the specific condition. CONCLUSIONS: Several useful methods exist to screen for cognitive impairment, and clinicians need to be familiar with the strengths and limitations of their preferred screening methods. In investigating the cause of dementia, routinely obtaining a VDRL test, cerebral imaging studies, serum cobalamin level, or folate level is unwarranted. 
Fluticasone propionate in Crohn's disease. Fluticasone propionate, a topically active corticosteroid of low systemic bioavailability after oral administration, has been used in a pilot study for the treatment of mild and moderately active Crohn's disease. Twelve patients received oral fluticasone propionate for three weeks, and the effects were monitored using the Crohn's disease activity index and by 111In granulocyte scanning, assessing inflammation from scan appearances, four day faecal excretion of radioactivity, and whole body excretion of radioactivity. All patients completed the trial. No serious side effects were reported. There was a significant fall in Crohn's disease activity index values over the three week treatment period (193 (84) v 122 (51), p less than 0.01). 111In leucocyte scan images were improved (seven patients) or unchanged (five patients). There was a significant fall in excretion of injected radioactivity calculated from whole body data (28 (21)% v 14 (0.7)%, p less than 0.05). There were no changes in plasma cortisol values, either basal or synacthen stimulated. Fluticasone propionate is a promising therapeutic agent for Crohn's disease that offers the possibility of controlling inflammation without inducing systemic corticosteroid side effects and which merits evaluation in a double blind trial versus conventional corticosteroids. 
Intravenous phentolamine test: diagnostic and prognostic use in reflex sympathetic dystrophy. In some patients, ongoing and evoked neurogenic pain is relieved by pharmacological or destructive block of the sympathetic innervation of the affected part. In others, sympatholysis is ineffective. The present report shows that these two groups of patients can be distinguished by a safe and simple diagnostic test. Individuals in whom the pain was transiently relieved by intravenous phentolamine (Regitine) were very likely to respond favourably to subsequent sympatholytic treatment with i.v. regional guanethidine. Individuals in whom the phentolamine test was negative did not enjoy pain relief from this type of sympatholysis. 
The moving, projected, annual total. A kinetic prognostic entity. A simple, inexpensive method of prognostically calculating and graphically recording annual case loads of the various deaths investigated by today's medicolegal offices is presented. Graphic depiction of the numerical data provides a convenient way to compare current prognostications with the records of preceding years. 
Study of brain electrolytes and organic osmolytes during correction of chronic hyponatremia. Implications for the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis. Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as "idiogenic osmoles" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. 
Interleukin-2-induced lung injury is mediated by oxygen free radicals. Interleukin-2 therapy leads to respiratory dysfunction caused by increased vascular permeability. This study examines the role of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR). Sheep (n = 6) with chronic lung lymph fistulae were given interleukin-2, 10(5) units/kg, as an intravenous bolus. The mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 13 to 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at 1 hour and remained elevated for 4 hours, although the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged at 4 mm Hg. Arterial oxygen tension fell from 88 to 77 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Lung lymph flow rose from 2.2 to 6.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05) at 3 hours. This rise coincided with an increase in the lymph/plasma protein ratio from 0.67 to 0.77 (p less than 0.05) and lymph protein clearance from 1.5 to 4.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05), indicating increased lung microvascular permeability. Interleukin-2 led to transient increases in plasma thromboxane B2 from 168 to 388 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and lung lymph thromboxane B2 from 235 to 694 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count fell from 8156 to 4375/mm3 (p less than 0.05) primarily caused by a 78% drop in lymphocyte count. Platelet count declined from 292 to 184 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea, 1 gm/kg, intravenously, (n = 6) prevented the interleukin-2-induced increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure, lung lymph flow, lymph/plasma protein ration, lymph protein clearance, and thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and lung lymph. The arterial oxygen tension decreased from 85 to 80 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count declined from 7854 to 6229/mm3 (p less than 0.05), but this was not as low nor as prolonged as the interleukin-2 group. Further, the decrease in platelet count was prevented (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 incubated with sheep or human leukocytes led to a dose-dependent increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry of dichlorofluorescein oxidation. These data indicate that interleukin-2 stimulates OFR generation and that OFR moderate the interleukin-2-induced increased lung permeability. 
Alterations in circulating lymphocyte number and function after circulation through colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-six patients undergoing curative resection for colorectal cancer were studied to determine the effect of the tumor on lymphocytes circulating through it. In the venous blood draining the tumor, there was an increased percentage of natural killer (NK) cells (p = 0.001), no difference in overall NK cell function, and decreased T-lymphocyte activation (p = 0.035) and proliferation (p = 0.002) compared with the lymphocytes in the arterial blood supplying the tumor. There were no significant differences in the control group of 16 patients. Local effects of colorectal cancer may include the ability to down-regulate T and NK cell function while increasing the number of NK cells. Means of enhancing antitumor activity therapeutically in an adjuvant setting, possibly through the portal vein during surgery, need to be considered, especially in the light of the immunosuppressive effects of surgery. 
Conventional therapy for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children. In children, the most frequent type of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Its treatment is aimed at inducing remission, preventing relapses and avoiding side-effects. Minimal-change disease is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. The conventional treatment consists of glucocorticosteroids and the most widely used derivative is prednisone. Initial treatment should be intensive, for example, prednisone for 12 weeks, in order to reduce the risk of subsequent relapse. Treatment of relapses should be standardized in order to categorize the patient's disease for further treatment. If a frequent relapser develops signs of steroid toxicity, alkylating drugs should be prescribed: cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil for eight weeks for frequent relapsers who are not steroid-dependent; cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks for those who are. In steroid-resistant cases, a renal biopsy is indicated and treatment should be administered according to histological changes. 
Intravenous adenosine in the emergency department management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. STUDY PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of adenosine in the treatment of emergency department patients with spontaneous paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DESIGN: An eight-month prospective outcome study. POPULATION: Patients 16 or more years old with PSVT by surface ECG criteria. Patients were excluded if there was clinical or hemodynamic evidence of hypoperfusion. MEASUREMENTS: Patient age, sex, PSVT rate, pretreatment blood pressure, history of cardiac disease, chronic drug therapy, and response to IV adenosine. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with 27 episodes of suspected PSVT met inclusion criteria. After IV adenosine, two patients were found to have atrial flutter, and one was found to have ventricular tachycardia. Twenty-four episodes of PSVT were diagnosed in the remaining 21 patients. There were eight male and 13 female patients with a mean age of 51 +/- 19 years (range, 16 to 80 years). Sixteen patients related a history of cardiovascular disease. The mean QRS rate during PSVT was 181 +/- 23. Twenty-three of 24 episodes (96%) were converted to sinus rhythm within 20 to 45 seconds of adenosine therapy. However, 13 of 23 of initial conversions (57%) were followed by recurrence of PSVT within five minutes. All 13 recurrences required therapy with other antiarrhythmic drugs for conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Complications of adenosine were noted in only four patients and were transient and clinically unimportant. CONCLUSION: IV adenosine effectively terminates PSVT in ED patients with spontaneous PSVT; recurrence of PSVT after adenosine is common in the ED population and should be treated with other antiarrhythmic agents, not repeated doses of adenosine; adenosine is useful in the differential diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias; and doubling the initial dose of adenosine to 12 mg would increase the likelihood of conversion with the first dose. 
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast: mammographic appearance and histologic correlation. The mammograms and histologic slides of 58 cases of atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast were retrospectively reviewed to determine the geographic correlation (direct, near, or remote) between mammographic abnormalities (if present) and the histologic findings. A direct mammographic-histologic correlation was found in 24 of the 58 cases (41%), near correlation in 15 (26%), and remote correlation in 19 (33%). Clustered microcalcifications were the most common mammographic abnormality that was directly correlated with AH at histologic examination. Atypical ductal hyperplasia was much more frequently associated with a direct mammographic-histologic correlation than was atypical lobular hyperplasia (48% vs 9%). The authors conclude that, although no pathognomonic appearance of AH was discovered, mammographic abnormalities similar to those of small cancers could be directly correlated with histologic findings in 41% of cases. Since AH has been shown to be associated with a five- to tenfold increased risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma, frequent clinical and at least yearly mammographic follow-up is suggested once AH is discovered. 
Effect of taurine on total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. A decrease in the formation/secretion of bile has been well documented in animals on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Either an excess or an imbalance of amino acids (AA) has been most often implicated. In view of recent work showing that taurine promotes bile flow, bile acid secretion, and protects against hepatotoxic bile acids, the effect of adding taurine (15 mg/dL) to an AA solution was examined in guinea pigs on TPN for 3 days. The TPN-taurine group had a larger bile flow than the group without taurine and had bile acid secretory rates (BASR) similar to those of controls who were on saline by central catheter and had free access to food. Bile composition showed an increase in the secondary bile acid, 7-ketolithocholate and a concomitant decrease in chenodeoxycholate (CDC) in both experimental groups. Taurine led to a reversal of the usual predominance of glycine over taurine conjugated bile acids as well as to increases in HCO3 in cholesterol secretion. In response to a challenge with a large load of CDC, the TPN-taurine animals increased their BASR beyond those observed in the two other groups. These observations suggest that the addition of taurine to TPN solutions could play a role in the prevention of altered biliary function associated with AA solutions. 
Phase I study of liposomal MTP-PE-activated autologous monocytes administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We have conducted a phase I study with autologous monocytes activated ex vivo and administered intraperitoneally in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Blood monocytes were collected by leukapheresis and then purified by counterflow elutriation (up to 10(9) cells, with a purity of greater than 90%). Ex vivo activation was obtained by incubating these cells with 1 micrograms liposomal MTP-PE/10(6) monocytes for 18 hours in hydrophobic culture bags at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide humidified air. The activated monocytes were then infused in the peritoneal cavity once a week for 5 consecutive weeks through an implanted peritoneal infusion system, Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul, MN), on an intrapatient dose-escalating schedule (10(7) to 10(9) monocytes). No severe adverse reactions occurred. Toxicity was mild, the chief acute reactions being fever (27%), chills (13%), and abdominal pain (25%). None of the side effects led to dose reduction. No consistent change in hemostatic function, liver function, or renal function was observed. Significant increases in granulocyte counts, neopterine, and acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) occurred in the peripheral blood. In vitro monocyte activation was demonstrated by the relapse of procoagulant activity and monokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha]) in the supernatants of cultured monocytes. Evidence for in vivo monocyte activation was provided by the increase of these monokines in the peritoneal fluids. Kinetic studies with indium-111 (111In)-labeled activated autologous monocytes in five patients suggest that these infused monocytes may remain in the peritoneal cavity for up to 7 days. This locoregional immunotherapeutic approach seems to be encouraging in view of adjuvant therapeutic modality in ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual intraabdominal disease following second-look laparotomy. 
Prognosis of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: an evaluation based on multivariate analysis of 90 cases. A multivariate analysis of data from 90 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was performed using Cox's regression model to identify factors possibly affecting their prognoses. Thirty-one patients underwent arterial anticancer chemotherapy, and the remaining 59 patients received transcatheter arterial embolization with anticancer agents. Four of 27 variables tested for all the patients (i.e., encapsulation [p less than 0.05], gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma [p less than 0.01], clinical stage [p less than 0.01] and therapy [p less than 0.01]) were found to be prognostically significant. Five of 27 variables tested were prognostically significant for the transcatheter arterial embolization group; they were an extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (p less than 0.01), encapsulation (p less than 0.01), alpha-fetoprotein (p less than 0.01), prothrombin time (p less than 0.01) and serum sodium (p less than 0.01). Regression equations were used to describe a prognostic index. A prognostic index was defined as the regression equation derived from the results of a total of 90 patients; PI-1 = eY, where PI-1 = prognostic index 1 Y = 1.549 (gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.344) + 0.778 (encapsulation - 1.622) + 0.818 (clinical stage - 1.800) + 1.760 (therapy - 1.344) and prognostic index 2, the regression equation derived from the results of the transcatheter arterial embolization group of patients; PI-2 = eY, where PI-2 = prognostic index 2 Y = 1.210 (extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.576) + 1.179 (encapsulation - 1.475) + 0.0001277 (alpha-fetoprotein - 1420.792) -0.039 (prothrombin time - 72.237) - 0.214 (serum sodium - 138.427). 
alpha 1-antagonists in the treatment of hypertension. A number of agents are now available to treat hypertension. One relatively new class of agents is the selective alpha 1-inhibitors, which have distinct advantages over earlier nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents. Three alpha 1-inhibitors are reviewed in this article: prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. These alpha 1-inhibitors are similar in chemical structure and pharmacological action. alpha 1-Inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing vascular tone in resistance and capacitance vessels. alpha 1-Inhibitors are similar in effectiveness in blood pressure lowering to other commonly used antihypertensive agents like the thiazide diuretic drugs and beta-blockers, which are efficacious as monotherapy in lowering pressure, as initial agents, or in combination with other antihypertensive agents in multidrug therapeutic regimens. alpha 1-Inhibitors are associated with a reasonably low incidence of serious adverse effects and are essentially free of any adverse metabolic effects. alpha 1-Inhibitors have been shown to beneficially effect blood lipids in several studies. The favorable lipid effect makes alpha 1-inhibitors especially appropriate to use in diabetic hypertensive and other patients with elevated serum lipid levels. The beneficial lipid effects may enhance the ability of alpha 1-inhibitors to prevent coronary heart disease, an outcome that has been difficult to demonstrate in thiazide-based trials. 
Glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload as consequences of exogenously generated free radicals in rabbit hearts. Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury, but it is unclear how they exert their deleterious effects on cellular metabolism. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that free radicals elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inhibit glycolysis as part of their mechanism of injury. We tested these ideas directly in hearts subjected to hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts before, during, and after 4 min of perfusion with H2O2 (0.75 mM) and Fe(3+)-chelate (0.1 mM). Isovolumic left ventricular pressure exhibited progressive functional deterioration and contracture after exposure to H2O2 + Fe3+. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed partial ATP depletion and sugar phosphate accumulation indicative of glycolytic inhibition. To measure [Ca2+]i, fluorine NMR spectra were acquired in a separate group of hearts loaded with the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA [5,5'-difluoro derivative of 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid]. Mean time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased from 347 +/- 14 nM in control to 1,026 +/- 295 nM 4 min after free radical generation (means +/- SEM, n = 7), and remained elevated thereafter. We conclude that free radicals induce clear-cut, specific derangements of cellular metabolism in the form of glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload. The observed increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that the deleterious effects of free radicals are at least partially mediated by secondary changes in cellular calcium homeostasis. 
Successful removal of massive intragastric gallstones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy and mechanical lithotripsy. We describe a case of massive gallstones discharged into the stomach through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and the successful removal of these stones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EEHL) and endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy (EML) for the prevention of gallstone ileus. A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea. Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach. To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted. They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally. Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol. The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic. 
Expression of specific UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in carcinogen-induced preneoplastic rat liver nodules. The expression of specific UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in 2-acetylaminofluorane-induced rat liver preneoplastic nodules was studied; livers from pair-fed littermates were used as controls. For comparison, liver and kidney from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated or untreated (control) rats were used. Steady-state UDP-glucuronosyltransferase mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis or in situ hybridization of tissue sections using a 30-mer oligonucleotide specific for the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (which is active toward 4-nitrophenol) or a double-stranded cDNA probe specific for androsterone-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. For 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the mRNA level was very low in control liver; there was a 15-fold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. This mRNA was present at relatively high concentration in the kidney and there was a threefold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene administration. In livers with preneoplastic nodules 1 mo after cessation of carcinogen administration, this mRNA concentration was approximately 15 times greater than in control liver. Similar changes in the level of the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were also observed by in situ hybridization of tissue sections. Immunocytochemical studies using an antiserum that recognizes the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase showed a marked increase in the concentration of this isoform in preneoplastic nodules compared with the adjacent nonnodular liver. 
Deleted HTLV-I provirus in blood and cutaneous lesions of patients with mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides. 
Bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in reoperative and primary coronary bypass surgery Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting is recognized as a preferred method of myocardial revascularization. However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%. No significant difference was found in the equality of survival distribution for the two groups. 
Developing anxiety-reduction procedures for a ventilator-dependent pediatric patient. This study evaluated two strategies to reduce anxiety behaviors which interfered with the daily tracheostomy care and ventilator maintenance of an eight-year-old ventilator-dependent boy. A multiple-baseline design (across ventilator and tracheostomy procedures) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an information-only procedure and combined relaxation and cognitive distraction procedures. Partial-interval recording was used to measure heart rate, disruptive mouth noises, and demands and complaints to staff members. The patient's behavior did not change during a no-intervention baseline or during the information-only condition. Cognitive distraction and relaxation procedures were introduced, first during ventilator checks and then during tracheostomy care; corresponding decreases in heart rate, mouth noises, and demands and complaints were noted. Gains were maintained at one year follow-up. Results suggest that information alone may not effectively reduce anxiety behaviors for some ventilator-dependent patients unless additional anxiety-reduction procedures are implemented. 
Hemilaryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failures. Radiation therapy has been the treatment most frequently used for early vocal cord cancer with surgery usually in the form of total laryngectomy held in reserve as a salvage option. We report our experience in selected patients who, having failed radiation therapy for their early vocal cord cancers, underwent frontolateral hemilaryngectomy as attempted salvage surgery. Between 1977 and 1986, fourteen patients at the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital underwent hemilaryngectomy for salvage of their stage I vocal cord squamous cell carcinoma after full-course radiation therapy had been unsuccessful. Over this same time period, 77 patients underwent total laryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failure. Three patients failed hemilaryngectomy, two of whom were ultimately salvaged with total laryngectomy. Thus a 79% salvage rate was achieved with hemilaryngectomy with an average followup of 90 months. The overall cure rate was 93% (13 of 14) with voice preservation in 86% (12 of 14). Decannulation, postoperative infection, and initiation of oral intake were not influenced by age. Such problems occurred more often in patients undergoing radiation therapy compared to those undergoing hemilaryngectomy without previous radiation therapy. These results indicate that hemilaryngectomy may be used for the salvage of radiation therapy failures of stage I vocal cord carcinoma with good success and without undue morbidity. 
Comparative effects of oral molsidomine and nifedipine on methylergometrine-induced coronary artery spasm. Twelve consecutive patients (10 men and 2 women, mean +/- standard deviation age 49 +/- 9 years) with chest pain, angiographically normal coronary arteries and coronary artery spasm documented by methylergometrine testing received a single oral dose of molsidomine (4 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion at a 24-hour interval. Coronary artery spasm was documented during coronary angiography in 6 patients (left anterior descending artery, 3; right coronary artery, 2; left circumflex, 1). In the remaining 6 patients, coronary artery spasm was documented by a positive methylergometrine test performed at the bedside, which provoked ST-segment elevation in the inferior (n = 3), anterior (n = 1) or lateral (n = 2) leads. Ninety minutes after administration of the study medication, methylergometrine testing was performed at the bedside, using incremental doses of up to 0.4 mg of methylergometrine. After molsidomine, 10 patients (83%) had a negative and 2 had a positive test; after nifedipine, 9 patients (75%) had a negative and 3 a positive test. Only 1 patient had a methylergometrine test that remained positive after either molsidomine or nifedipine. Therefore, molsidomine appears as effective as nifedipine in suppressing methylergometrine-induced coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina. In addition, patients not responding to 1 of the study medications may respond to the other. 
Characterisation of inflammatory cells associated with "idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis". During ureterolysis in a patient with "idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis", fresh samples of peri-ureteric and peri-aortic tissue were obtained. An abdominal CT scan confirmed the peri-aortic distribution of the inflammation associated with advanced abdominal aortic atherosclerosis. Histology confirmed the presence of fibrosis and a variable chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify the inflammatory cells. B and T lymphocytes were present with the majority of T lymphocytes of the T helper phenotype. The majority of lymphocytes and macrophages and most vascular endothelial cells were HLA-DR positive. Ki67 and BerH2 staining was found in B cells and T helper cells, indicating that these cells were proliferating and activated. These findings compare with the characterisation of inflammatory cells associated with "inflammatory aneurysms" and with the inflammatory cells present in the spectrum of inflammation seen as a complication of advanced atherosclerosis--conditions known as "chronic peri-aortitis". It is suggested that our findings support the view that idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis represents clinical chronic peri-aortitis seen in an undilated aorta. 
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in persons aged 80 years and over. Seventy-one patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years (mean +/- standard deviation 82 +/- 2) with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement alone (n = 35, group 1) or in combination with a coronary artery bypass procedure without any other valve procedure (n = 36, group 2). Preoperatively, 91% had severe cardiac limitations (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Hospital mortality was 12.7% overall (9 of 71), 5.7% (2 of 35) for group 1 and 19.4% (7 of 36) for group 2. Perioperatively, 1 patient (1.4%) had a stroke. Survival from late cardiac death at 1 and 3 years was 98.2 and 95.5%, respectively, for all patients, 100% for patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, and 96.3 and 91.2%, respectively, for patients who underwent aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass. Eighty-three percent of surviving patients had marked symptomatic improvement. Freedom from all valve-related complications (thromboembolism, anticoagulant, endocarditis, reoperation or prosthetic failure) was 93.3 and 80.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Thus, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years are encouragingly low, although the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting increases short- and long-term mortality. 
Internal jugular vein thrombosis after ovulation induction with gonadotropins. An unusual case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complicated by internal jugular vein and mediastinal thrombosis is presented. Hemoconcentration and perhaps immobilization appear to be the most probable causative factors. The patient was successfully treated with heparin anticoagulation. An uneventful twin pregnancy resulted from the stimulation cycle. 
Nutritional support in liver failure. The most important manifestations of advanced liver disease are malnutrition, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Appropriate and optimal nutritional and metabolic support with specially formulated solutions enriched in branched-chain amino acids, together with other advanced treatments such as plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis, can correct the most important metabolic and clinical aberrations and temporarily improve the quality of life. However, the ultimately poor prognosis of patients with severe liver failure has not been altered significantly to date by the provision of nonspecific or specifically tailored nutrient regimens. The prognosis appears to depend on the arrest, correction, or reversal of the primary pathophysiologic process. 
Twelve cases of Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of skin. In seven of 12 cases of Ber-H2 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL) disease remained localised to skin, and in five there was extracutaneous spread. Four patients had histological evidence of pre-existing or coexisting mycosis fungoides, and three patients had a long standing history of eczema or ichthyosis. In two cases the presence of a T phenotype was shown in frozen sections, and in a further six cases a T phenotype was firmly established in paraffin wax sections. Four patients died less than one year after presentation (two with disseminated lymphoma; two from other causes); one died at five years with widespread lymphoma and the remaining seven cases were alive one to 14 1/2 years after presentation. Three of the four patients with associated mycosis fungoides had prolonged survival, contrary to the findings of previous reports which suggest secondary Ki-1 ALCL behaves aggressively. The recognition of these tumours is important because of their relatively good prognosis. The diagnosis can be readily substantiated immunohistochemically, using a simple panel of antibodies. 
Electrophysiological and binding studies on intact NCB-20 cells suggest presence of a low affinity sigma receptor. Whole cell voltage clamp studies were performed on NCB-20 cells to examine physiological responses to drugs possessing affinities for sigma receptors. Those drugs [haloperidol, alpha-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinebutano l (BMY-14802), pentazocine, N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10047), 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine (3-PPP), phencyclidine, 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP), (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801)] caused an apparent inward current, which was due to blockade of a tonic, outward potassium current. The rank order of drug potencies in producing this effect generally resembled the rank orders of sigma-receptor affinities for the drugs, except that a reverse stereoselectivity was observed for several drugs. [3H](+)-SKF-10047 labeled two sites in intact NCB-20 cells (Kd = 49 nM, Bmax = 1.0 pmol/mg protein and Kd = 9.6 microM, Bmax = 69 pmol/mg protein). The high affinity site was similar pharmacologically to the sigma receptor assayed in membrane fragments from NCB-20 cells. However, the low affinity site showed a slightly different profile, highlighted by a reverse stereoselectivity. The rank order of drug potencies was as follows at the low affinity site: haloperidol greater than BMY-14802 greater than (-)-pentazocine greater than (+)-pentazocine greater than (-)-SKF-10047 greater than (-)-3-PPP greater than (+)-SKF-10047 greater than (+)-3-PPP greater than phencyclidine greater than TCP greater than MK-801. 
Endothelin and calcium signaling in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells. Endothelin (ET)-mediated Ca++ signaling in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells was studied by measuring free intracellular Ca++ (Ca++i) levels with the fluorescent Ca++ indicator, fura-2. ET-1 produced biphasic increases in Ca++i consisting of a transient peak elevation followed by a sustained plateau phase. Both peak and plateau Ca++i responses to 5 nM ET-1 were reduced by depletion of extracellular Ca++. Peak responses were also attenuated by inhibitors of inositol phosphate metabolism, whereas plateau responses were affected by dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonists and antagonists and by differentiation. These results suggest that peak Ca++i responses to ET-1 involve mobilization of Ca++ from inositol phosphate-sensitive intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca++ through nonclassical Ca++ channels, whereas plateau responses are mediated by Ca++ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-gated channels. 
Endoscopic biopsy technique for acquiring larger mucosal samples. Biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine are most often obtained using the traditional advance-and-close method with flexible endoscopes by extending an open forceps several millimeters beyond the endoscope tip to sample the mucosa, all under direct vision. We developed an alternative "turn-and-suction" endoscopic biopsy technique that permits the acquisition of larger mucosal samples. The biopsy forceps is advanced into the lumen, opened, and withdrawn backward until it is flush with the endoscope tip. Next, the endoscope tip is turned gently into the wall while air is suctioned from the lumen, and the biopsy forceps is very slightly advanced and then closed, usually without direct visualization. After straightening the endoscope tip, the biopsy is obtained by withdrawing the forceps and avulsing a superficial mucosal sample. By using this new method, we have safely taken over 10,000 biopsies without complications in endoscopic surveillance research protocols in patients at risk for gastrointestinal cancer. To compare the sizes of biopsies obtained with these two techniques, histologic sections of 341 mucosal samples from 12 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis were studied retrospectively. The mean greatest length of biopsy sections using the traditional technique was 4.72 mm, and using our new technique was 7.35 mm (56% longer). The turn-and-suction endoscopic biopsy method is best applied when flat mucosa is randomly sampled to seek microscopic pathologic changes that are not visible endoscopically, and may be advantageous for various non-histologic research analyses of gastrointestinal mucosa which are limited by tissue quantity. 
A multi-centre collaborative study into the treatment of menorrhagia by Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium. OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and clinical effectiveness of Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium in the treatment of menorrhagia. DESIGN--A prospective 3-year observational multi-centre study. SETTING--Gynaecological units in the UK and USA with special interest in endoscopic laser surgery. SUBJECTS--859 women with menorrhagia resistant to medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Duration of laser ablation, intra- and post-operative complications, amenorrhoea rate, oligomenorrhoea rate, and woman's subjective assessment of treatment. RESULTS--No major complications occurred in 859 treatments. Four (0.4%) cases of transient fluid overload, 4 (0.4%) of infection, and 3 (0.3%) of uterine perforation occurred. Each of the perforations occurred during insertion of the rigid instruments and none was produced by the laser. There were no major haemorrhages, no blood transfusions were needed, and no woman required a laparotomy. The mean duration of the laser ablation was 24 min, and the average stay in hospital was less than 24 h. Of the 479 women followed up for at least 6 months after treatment 288 (60%) developed complete amenorrhoea and 152 (32%) reported continuing but satisfactorily reduced menstruation; 39 (8%) failed to improve with the first treatment, but 26 of them responded to a second laser ablation. Overall 466 (97%) had a satisfactory response to laser ablation and only 13 (3%) required subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSION--Endometrial laser ablation would appear to be a popular, safe, effective and economical alternative to hysterectomy for the treatment of menorrhagia. 
Angiographic assessment of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis The severity of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis was quantitatively assessed in 91 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were allocated to treatment in the acute stage with either a thrombolytic agent (100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator given over 3 h, 49 patients) or a placebo (42 patients). Heparin and aspirin were given to both groups until angiography was performed. Digital subtracted images of the infarct-related coronary vessel were obtained 10 to 14 days after hospital admission and were subsequently analyzed with the use of a computer-assisted coronary stenosis measurement system. Neither treatment group differed significantly in age, gender or location of the culprit coronary lesion. Median values (90% range) in the thrombolysis and control groups were, respectively, 1.95 (0.9 to 5.3) mm versus 1.7 (0.9 to 3.4) mm for stenosis length; 1.4 (0.8 to 2.7) mm versus 1.4 (0.9 to 1.8) mm for minimal luminal diameter; 57% (36% to 75%) versus 58% (44% to 71%) for diameter obstruction; 82% (59% to 95%) versus 82% (68% to 92%) for geometric area obstruction; and 78% (58% to 91%) versus 79% (66% to 90%) for densitometric area obstruction. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for any of these measurements. Thus, in this study no significant differences in anatomy or severity of residual coronary stenosis could be demonstrated at 10 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with a recanalized infarct-related vessel, whether or not thrombolytic therapy was given on admission. These results indicate that with effective antithrombotic treatment, gradual endogenous fibrinolysis or more rapid lysis induced by the infusion of a thrombolytic agent results in a similar infarct-related coronary lesion at the time of hospital discharge. 
Hypertensive renal damage. The primary focus of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy should be to control systemic blood pressure in a simple, affordable, and nontoxic fashion that provides an adequate quality of life. Although newer agents provide hope for greater capability of preventing renal dysfunction, their cost may prevent their broad availability in the black hypertensive population (see Chapter 5). Judicious use of traditional therapies, combined with newer approaches when possible, may offer prescribing physicians the best opportunity to control blood pressure in ways to avoid renal dysfunction. The lessons of the past 20 years have taught us that lowering blood pressure by any means helps in reducing target organ damage. More recent observations in hypertensive blacks illustrate the need for improved therapies to prevent renal dysfunction. A more physiologic approach to blood pressure control in the black patient that conserves perfusion to the kidney may delay the development of nephrosclerosis. Increased awareness, educational support, and encouragement will be necessary to insure compliance with therapy for a disease that is largely asymptomatic. 
Epstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection. 
Chronic pain: a PET study of the central effects of percutaneous high cervical cordotomy. We have studied 5 patients with unilateral, severe chronic pain due to cancer before and after percutaneous, ventrolateral cervical cordotomy to investigate the central effects of the procedure. The aim was to identify the functional anatomical correlates of abolishing unilateral nociceptive input to the brain. Patients were investigated by positron emission tomography using C15O2 to evaluate cerebral blood flow. Comparisons were made between the patients with unilateral pain before cordotomy and normal volunteers. These demonstrated significantly less blood flow in 3 out of 4 of the individual quadrants of the hemithalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.01-0.05). These differences were abolished by cordotomy. Comparison of the patients before and after cordotomy showed a significant decrease in blood flow in the dorsal anterior quadrant of the thalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.05) which was normalised after cordotomy. There were no significant changes in the prefrontal or primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that chronic pain results in a decrease of synaptic activity at thalamic level either from decreased activity in neurones projecting to that region and/or attenuated local neuronal firing. We have demonstrated no secondary remote effects in cortex, indicating the importance of subcortical mechanisms in central responses to chronic pain. 
A fatality after antipyrine administration. An 87-year-old woman died after the administration of an intravenous injection of antipyrine during the course of an investigation of the efficacy of oxerutins in venous ulceration. This is believed to be the first such fatality. 
Evaluation of neck lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma We studied a series of 150 patients treated for thoracic esophageal carcinoma at our institution. The patients were divided into two matched groups. Group B underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy only; group A also underwent bilateral neck lymph node dissection. The rates of operative mortality and operative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. The 5-year survival rate was 38.7% overall (48.7% in group A and 33.7% in group B). Group A had a significantly better survival curve than group B. Twenty patients (26.0%) in group A had metastasis in the dissected neck lymph nodes. The 4-year survival rate of these patients was 47.9%. The significantly better survival of group A and the satisfactory prognosis in the patients with positive cervical lymph nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of neck lymph node dissection in radical operation for thoracic esophageal carcinoma. 
Danazol-induced hepatocellular adenomas. A case report and review of the literature. We report a case of hepatocellular adenomas in a 39-year-old woman who had been taking danazol for uterine fibroids. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which multiple hepatocellular adenomas were discovered after only 6 months of danazol intake. 
Extramedullary nasal plasmacytoma. The literature on this rare tumour has been reviewed and three cases of nasal plasmacytoma are described. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic IgA and Kappa determinants in all cases. Two patients are disease-free at the present time, the third developed an IgG-k multiple myeloma, previously not described in the literature. 
The nature of elder impairment and its impact on family caregivers' health and psychosocial functioning. This study assessed the nature of elder impairment and its impact on the health and psychosocial functioning of family caregivers. All caregivers were daughters or daughters-in-law living with an elderly parent. Contrary to expectations and previous research, no differences were revealed among caregivers of cognitively impaired, functionally impaired, and nonimpaired elderly relatives in terms of self-reported health or psychosocial functioning. Thus, other aspects of the caregiving context, such as familial generation, gender, and living arrangement, may affect caregiver health and psychosocial functioning more than the nature of the elder's impairment. 
Leukoaraiosis correlates with cerebral hypoperfusion in vascular dementia. Leukoaraiosis quantified by computerized densitometric measurements of reduced Hounsfield numbers was correlated with local cerebral blood flow on the same computed tomographic images of 35 patients with multi-infarct dementia and 16 age-matched elderly normal volunteers. The ratio for area of frontal leukoaraiosis to total area of parenchyma among the patients was significantly greater than that among the normal volunteers (5.8 +/- 2.3% compared with 3.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.001). Severity of leukoaraiosis around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles correlated significantly with severity of leukoaraiosis of the centrum semiovale adjacent to the bodies of the lateral ventricles. Cerebral blood flow values for all representative cerebral regions except the parietal white matter were reduced among the patients compared with the normal volunteers. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that reduced cerebral perfusion in the putamen and thalamus correlated significantly with the severity of leukoaraiosis. Cerebral hypoperfusion in territories supplied by deep penetrating arteries may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis. 
Ataxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. 
Responsiveness of peripheral veins to vasodilators and the effect of nifedipine on alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in hypertension. Vasodilators have varying hemodynamic properties that may be important in determining their efficacy for different disorders. We used the dorsal hand vein technique to measure the effects of several vasodilators infused locally and to measure the action of systemically administered nifedipine. The venodilatory effects of hydralazine, verapamil, diazoxide, and nitroglycerin were determined in peripheral veins of healthy subjects. The potency (ED50, the dose producing half-maximal response) was as follows: nitroglycerin (0.0007 micrograms/min) greater than verapamil (6.5 micrograms/min) greater than diazoxide (75 micrograms/min) greater than hydralazine (660 micrograms/min). The effect of oral nifedipine on alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of hand veins was determined. Nifedipine given in therapeutic doses for the treatment of hypertension was associated with a threefold increase in the ED50 for phenylephrine (92 to 277 ng/min; p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (2.9 to 11.5 ng/min; p less than 0.05). Therapeutic doses of nifedipine are associated with measurable shifts in the dose-response curves to these two alpha-adrenergic agonists in the hand vein. The hand vein technique can be used not only to compare the potency of locally infused drugs but also to measure venous effects of vasoactive drugs at therapeutic concentrations achieved after systemic administration. 
Cytomegalovirus esophagitis in AIDS: diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy. We have reviewed 28 esophageal biopsies from 28 patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), over a 1-yr period. Indications for esophageal biopsy were dysphagia persisting after antifungal therapy and/or radiologic evidence of esophageal ulcer. We compared the frequency of detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain with immunoperoxidase staining for CMV antigens. Five biopsies were positive for CMV by H&E stain and immunoperoxidase. Infected cells could often be identified in the granulation tissue and, in one severe case, in stromal papillae of the intact mucosa. Squamous cells were never positive. Thirteen biopsies consisted only of squamous epithelium, and all of these were negative by both techniques. Among the remaining 10 cases, no CMV inclusions were identified by H&E. Three of these biopsies displayed staining for viral antigens. In all cases positive by immunoperoxidase, numerous cells positive for viral antigens did not display any of the CMV-specific morphologic diagnostic criteria. Other coexisting diagnoses included candidiasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and malignant lymphoma. We conclude 1) CMV infection of the esophagus is common in AIDS patients with esophageal ulcer or esophagitis resistant to antifungal therapy; 2) multiple infections or neoplasms may coexist; 3) since CMV apparently does not infect squamous epithelium and only rarely endothelium in stromal papillae, deep biopsies are necessary for diagnosis; and 4) immunoperoxidase staining is required for maximum diagnostic yield. 
Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children. Using magnetic resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects. Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population. 
Noninfectious colitis associated with short gut syndrome in infants. We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month period. The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino acid-containing formula. Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema, patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without ulcerations or pseudomembranes. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings. 
Stroke and hypertension and its prevention. Systolic and diastolic hypertension in both men and women is a well-established risk factor for the development of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Antihypertensive treatment decreases the risk, but questions remain as to the precise level of hypertension to be treated, whether the effects of antihypertensive treatment are blunted with increasing age, and the best type of antihypertensive drug or combination of drugs to be used. Further questions remain concerning the incidence of pseudohypertension and the potentially harmful effects of its treatment on the brain, and the possibility that fluctuations in blood pressure may be worse than elevation alone. A pragmatic approach would be to treat hypertension with vigor in the young, with caution in the mature, and with reluctance in the old. 
Relative roles of cardiac and arterial baroreceptors in vasopressin regulation during hemorrhage in conscious dogs. To determine the relative roles of cardiac and sinoaortic baroreceptors in mediation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, hemorrhage was performed in five groups of conscious splenectomized dogs: 1) all nerves intact; 2) either chronic surgical or acute pharmacological (intrapericardial lidocaine) cardiac denervation (CD); 3) chronic sinoarotic denervation (SAD); 4) combined chronic sinoartic denervation plus either chronic or acute cardiac denervation (SAD + CD); and 5) all nerves intact, but with ganglionic blockade. Hemorrhage (0.5 ml/min/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure similarly in the intact and CD groups. Decreases in mean arterial pressure were augmented in SAD, SAD + CD, and ganglion-blocked groups compared with responses in intact and CD groups. There were no differences in responses of plasma AVP to hemorrhage in the intact and CD groups, but the AVP response was significantly blunted in the SAD + CD group as compared with SAD alone. When compared during the early stage of hemorrhage, at the same reduction in mean arterial pressure, the rise in AVP was greater in the ganglion-blocked group than in the SAD + CD group, but was less than in the intact group. With a protocol to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg over the same period (42 +/- 0.6 minutes) in four of the groups, the blood volume required to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg was similar in the intact (20 +/- 1 ml/kg) and CD (21 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups, but was less in the SAD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) and SAD + CD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups. Again, similar increases were observed in AVP between the intact (50 +/- 9 pg/ml) and CD (51 +/- 9 pg/ml) groups, whereas increases in AVP were diminished in the SAD (11 +/- 3 pg/ml) and SAD + CD (7 +/- 2 pg/ml) groups. In the presence of an AVP antagonist, decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in total peripheral resistance with hemorrhage were affected similarly in both the intact and CD groups, whereas hemodynamic impairment by AVP blockade was less marked in the SAD and SAD + CD groups. These results indicate that cardiac receptors are not the major regulators of AVP release during progressive hemorrhage in conscious dogs. However, when the complicating influences of sinoaortic reflexes were eliminated, a modest role for cardiac receptors was uncovered. 
Excimer laser-facilitated balloon angioplasty of a nondilatable lesion. Preliminary clinical experience with excimer laser coronary angioplasty shows that it is a safe and effective means of achieving nonsurgical coronary revascularization in selected patients but specific indications for its use are as yet undefined. In the present report a specific indication is proposed for the use of the excimer laser: to facilitate balloon inflation in a rigid stenosis that fails to dilate despite high balloon inflation pressures. 
Disc degeneration in magnetic resonance imaging. A comparative biochemical, histologic, and radiologic study in cadaver spines. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of 89 autopsied intervertebral discs from 22 cadaveric lumbar spines were correlated with biochemical composition, conventional radiography, and histologic structure to study the nature of disc intensity changes seen in MRI. Discs with a low signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI were characterized by shortening of relaxation times, dehydration, and decreases in total proteoglycan content and chondroitin-keratan sulfate ratios in the nucleus pulposus. This corresponded well with previously published studies. In histologic structure, no obvious differences between MRI findings were found. In conclusion, a low signal intensity in a lumbar disc on T2-weighted MRI probably reflects a true biochemical disc degeneration, but its relation to structural degenerative changes is uncertain. Therefore, MRI seems to be a sensitive and a specific imaging modality for detecting pathologic biochemical disc changes in the spine of a young adult. 
Marijuana as antiemetic medicine: a survey of oncologists' experiences and attitudes. A random-sample, anonymous survey of the members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was conducted in spring 1990 measuring the attitudes and experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was mailed to about one third (N = 2,430) of all United States-based ASCO members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1,035). More than 44% of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer chemotherapy patient. Almost one half (48%) would prescribe marijuana to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group, respondents considered smoked marijuana to be somewhat more effective than the legally available oral synthetic dronabinol ([THC] Marinol; Unimed, Somerville, NJ) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be available by prescription. These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a "currently accepted medical use," at issue in an ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is more extensive, and their opinions of it are more favorable, than the regulatory authorities appear to have believed. 
Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients. A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events. 
Reversible renal insufficiency due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertensive nephrosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To review the incidence of reversible renal insufficiency in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis undergoing antihypertensive therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 73 patients in a long-term blood pressure control study that compared the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus conventional antihypertensive agents compared with placebo plus antihypertensive agents. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient treatment center. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into group 1, which received enalapril plus conventional antihypertensives, and group 2, which received placebo plus conventional antihypertensives. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were measured, and imaging studies of the main renal arteries were done. MAIN RESULTS: In group 1, eight of 42 patients (19%, 95% CI, 9% to 34%) developed reversible renal insufficiency, defined as an unexpected increase in serum creatinine of 88 mumol/L or higher. Six episodes of reversible renal insufficiency occurred during July and August when temperatures were 32.2 degrees C to 37.8 degrees C (90 degrees F to 100 degrees F). Renal artery stenosis was excluded by renal arteriogram or ultrasonic duplex scanning. All eight group-1 patients had a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure below their baseline level during reversible renal insufficiency (mean change, -28 +/- 10 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). The increase in the serum creatinine level was inversely correlated with the decrease in the mean arterial pressure (r = -0.68, P less than 0.01). Reversible renal insufficiency was successfully managed by withdrawing or reducing enalapril as well as other antihypertensive agents. Subsequently, enalapril was tolerated by seven of the eight patients without recurrence of renal insufficiency. In contrast, none of 31 (CI, 0% to 11%) patients in group 2 developed reversible renal insufficiency despite the fact that both the incidence of decreases in mean arterial pressure in 6 of 31 patients (19%) and the magnitude of the decreases in mean arterial pressure (mean change, -33 +/- 16 mm Hg) were similar to those observed in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible renal insufficiency in hypertensive nephrosclerosis associated with ACE inhibitor therapy correlates with relative hypotension, is not dependent on renal artery stenosis, and can usually be managed by dose reduction. 
Partial lamellar sclerouvectomy for ciliary body and choroidal tumors. The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy. This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina. In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%). Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis. A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey. Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery. The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor. Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%). There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma. Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors. 
Anaesthetic management of myocardial infarction in a parturient. Myocardial infarction is encountered rarely during pregnancy, but when it occurs the event is life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Data on maternal and fetal outcome are limited, but overall maternal mortality approaches 35%, and 40% of deaths occur during the third trimester. We present a case of myocardial infarction occurring at 38 weeks gestation, and discuss the anaesthetic management of the problems encountered during labour and delivery. 
National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group report on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Blood pressure measurements obtained in a physician's office may not represent a patient's blood pressure during an entire day. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides multiple readings over time. This review of the literature on ABPM addresses the current state of ABPM methods, normal blood pressure profiles, the clinical and research uses of ABPM, cost considerations, and recommendations for use of ABPM in selected circumstances. Current ABPM devices use either auscultatory or oscillometric methods to determine blood pressure. A rigorous comparison of these methods is needed to determine whether one method is more reliable. A nonbiased assessment of all available equipment is necessary. Normative data provided by ABPM research are needed for populations by age, race, gender, body habitus, and conditions, such as pregnancy. While ABPM is not cost-effective for all hypertensive patients, it can assist in the evaluation of such problems as target organ complications, syncopal episodes, episodic hypertension, and autonomic dysfunction. 
Reversible hypertriiodothyroninaemia due to adrenal insufficiency. It is well known that an excess of glucocorticoids affects thyroid tests. The effect of adrenal deficiency on thyroid hormones is less well defined. We here describe the case of a 33-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who was cured by trans-sphenoidal surgery. During the postoperative period, a secondary adrenal insufficiency developed. The thyroid blood tests then revealed elevated L-triiodothyronine (T3) levels and a decrease in reverse T3. These findings suggest that secondary adrenal deficiency may be associated with high T3 levels, which may be due to an increase in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. 
Survival and vehicular spread of human rotaviruses: possible relation to seasonality of outbreaks. In developing countries rotavirus infections account for nearly 6% of all diarrheal episodes and for 20% of diarrhea-associated deaths of young children. Even in industrialized countries rotavirus diarrhea in the young is among the leading causes of hospitalization. In temperate regions institutional outbreaks of the disease occur mainly in cold dry weather, whereas in tropical settings the seasonality is less well defined. Waterborne outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis have been recorded; air, hands, fomities, and food may also act as vehicles for this infection. Rotaviruses can survive for weeks in potable and recreational waters and for at least 4 hours on human hands. In air and on nonporous inanimate surfaces, the survival of rotaviruses is favored by a relative humidity of less than or equal to 50% and viral infectivity can be retained for several days. Rotaviruses are relatively resistant to commonly used hard-surface disinfectants and hygienic hand-wash agents. 
Stress hormone and blood glucose response following acute stroke in the elderly. We studied the relation of reactive hyperglycemia, stress hormone response, and outcome in 23 consecutive elderly patients (median age 80 [range 75-92] years) following an acute first stroke. The median delay from the onset of the stroke to the first blood sample (day 0) was 9 (range 4-22) hours. Subsequent blood samples were taken, after fasting, for the determination of blood glucose, cortisol, catecholamine, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and lactate concentrations on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90. For all 23 patients, a significant relation was found between the blood glucose concentration and survival (p = 0.03) and the blood glucose concentration decreased with time (p less than 0.001). There was also a significant relation between blood glucose concentration and outcome (p = 0.02). For the 15 patients with complete data, the major determinants of the blood glucose concentration were the cortisol, insulin, and glucagon concentrations (all p less than 0.001), which accounted for 42% of the variance. When all the indexes were analyzed together by logistic regression, only the cortisol concentration was related to outcome (p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia following a stroke probably reflects the intensity of the stress hormone response. We have confirmed that hyperglycemia is a predictor of outcome in persons with stroke. 
Diagnostic relevance of trigeminal evoked potentials following infraorbital nerve stimulation. A new tool in neurophysiological exploration of the trigeminal nerve has recently been introduced. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem. The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma). They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia. Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases). Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone. 
The 72-hour examination as a predictor of recovery in motor complete quadriplegia. Twenty-nine C4 to C7 motor-complete spinal cord injured subjects were evaluated to determine whether the manual muscle test (MMT) performed within 24 hours of injury or at 72 hours after injury better predicts short-term functional muscle recovery. A single muscle in the zone of injury that had a muscle grade between 1 and 3, inclusive, was evaluated serially in each patient from admission to three months. Increase in muscle strength to grade 4 or better was defined as success. Outcomes were evaluated by the Fisher exact test. Using the less-than-24-hour MMT, 12 of 17 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs four of 12 subjects with grade 1 or 2 muscle strength achieved success (p greater than .05). Using the 72-hour MMT, all 11 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs five of the 18 subjects with less than grade 3 muscle strength achieved success (p less than .001). Short-term functional muscle recovery in the zone of injury in cervical motor-complete quadriplegia is better predicted by the 72-hour MMT than by the less-than-24-hour MMT. 
Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. 
Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor on rodent gliomas and normal brain. In a study examining the possible therapeutic effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) on malignant gliomas without expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptors, RG-2 glioma cells were tested in vitro as well as in a rat experimental glioma model. A growth inhibition assay revealed no inhibiting effect in vitro up to a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml rHuTNF-alpha. Receptor-binding studies showed that RG-2 cells did not present specific receptors for rHuTNF-alpha. The pharmacokinetics of rHuTNF-alpha after intravenous injection were studied with respect to serum, tissue, and brain tumor concentrations and showed increased glioma concentrations of (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 0.47 +/- 0.18 ng TNF/mg brain compared to 0.15 +/- 0.05 ng TNF/mg brain in the normal contralateral hemisphere. No therapeutic effect on solid RG-2 gliomas could be observed after stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF/10 microliter buffer solution into the tumor in 10 animals. Immunohistochemical studies after stereotactic injection of rHuTNF-alpha showed total disappearance of the substance after 24 hours without internalization into tumor cells. Stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF 10 microliters into normal brain resulted in marked inflammatory response around the injection track, including microvascular thrombosis. These results demonstrate that rHuTNF has neither direct nor indirect cytotoxic activity on RG-2 glioma cells. Furthermore, before clinical use of rHuTNF-alpha in malignant gliomas, the authors suggest that receptor studies be done in each patient. In receptor-positive patients undergoing treatment with rHuTNF-alpha, precautions should be taken to prevent local encephalitic reactions. 
Mid-brain pathology of Wilson's disease: MRI analysis of three cases. MRI scans were obtained from three patients with Wilson's disease, all of whom showed rigidity and dysarthria; two also showed tremor and dystonia. Two had been treated with D-penicillamine for seven and 14 years, respectively and their neurological abnormalities had improved, but the third patient had not been treated. T2-weighted MRI of the mid-brain in all three revealed the characteristic "face of the giant panda" sign, consisting of high signal intensity in the tegmentum except for red nucleus, preservation of signal intensity of the lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and hypo-intensity of the superior colliculus. The clinical significance of these MRI abnormalities is discussed. 
In vitro activities of acridone alkaloids against Pneumocystis carinii. Acridone alkaloids isolated from plants of the family Rutaceae have antiplasmodial activity in rodent models of malaria. Because a variety of antimalarial agents have also been shown to have activity against Pneumocystis carinii, we tested six of these alkaloids in an established culture model for P. carinii. Atalaphillinine and glycobismine A inhibited growth of cultured P. carinii at concentrations of 2.7 and 1.7 microM, respectively. This potency of effect is similar to that of chloroquine (3 microM) but somewhat less than that of primaquine (0.4 microM), which was previously evaluated in the same system. 
Survivorship analysis and confidence intervals. An assessment with reference to the Stanmore total knee replacement. Survivorship analysis is a useful way of expressing the long-term results of joint replacement: it provides a means of comparing the life span of one type of prosthesis with another. However, such studies should include a full life-table and the confidence intervals for the survival rates at given times. At least 40 surviving prostheses are required to provide reliable results. 
Proteus syndrome. Ultrastructural study of linear verrucous and depigmented nevi. Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by multifocal overgrowths that can involve any structure of the body. Clinical manifestations include macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, subcutaneous masses, exostosis, cerebroid thickening of palms and soles, and linear skin lesions. About 50 cases have been described, but the ultrastructural features of the linear skin lesions have not been characterized. We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities. 
An apparent cluster of congenital hypopituitarism in central Massachusetts: magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal studies. Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland. 
Pediatric heart transplantation for congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Orthotopic heart transplantation has become an accepted therapy for adult patients with end-stage heart disease. In newborns and infants, this procedure is still controversial because of the unknown long-term results and the lack of donor organs. Since March 1988, we have performed orthotopic heart transplantation in 11 infants and children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 6), cardiomyopathy (n = 4), or congenital endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 1). The smallest infant was 3 days old and weighed 2,650 g. Four of 15 potential donors had to be refused for various medical reasons, and 4 were transferred to our hospital for organ retrieval. Seven hearts were procured remotely. We accepted weight mismatches up to 105% between donor and recipient. There were three perioperative deaths, two in patients 5 and 17 days old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 1 in a 2-year-old patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy. All 3 patients had drug-resistant right heart failure. A 2-year-old girl with a dilated cardiomyopathy died 2 months after transplantation owing to severe pulmonary embolism originating from the superior vena cava. The remaining 7 patients are alive and well between 1 month and 31 months after transplantation. Angiographic follow-up has not revealed signs of graft atherosclerosis at 2 years. 
Metastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of twelve cases with a review of the literature. Metastatic basal cell carcinoma was found in 12 patients at the University of Wisconsin Mohs Surgery Clinic during the period 1936 to 1989. All patients were white men. The time of onset of the primary tumor ranged from childhood to 71 years. Eleven patients had previous treatment for basal cell carcinoma; two patients had received x-ray radiation to the face for teenage acne. The locations of the primary basal cell carcinomas were the face (n = 10), back (n = 1), and arm (n = 1). The primary tumors ranged from 3.6 x 3.0 to 20.0 x 7.0 cm. The interval from onset to the first sign of metastases ranged from 7 to 34 years. In all cases, the primary tumor was histologically identical to the metastatic lesion. Perineural extension of the basal cell carcinoma in the primary lesion was found in five cases. Regional lymph nodes were the most frequent site of metastasis. Treatment consisted of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Only two patients survived more than 5 years after surgical treatment. One patient has survived 25 years and is still alive. 
Complete external iliac artery disruption after percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty in two young children: successful repair with hypogastric artery transposition. The majority of vascular injuries in young children are iatrogenic. This is a report of two complete external iliac artery disruptions occurring during percutaneous transfemoral balloon aortic valvuloplasty in a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old child. The damaged external iliac artery was bypassed by extensively mobilizing the hypogastric surgery and rotating it upward to anastomose it to the proximal common femoral artery. Normal limb pulses, function, and growth were noted in follow-up. 
Sarcomatous change in a teratoma after treatment of testicular carcinoma. Treatment can transform the metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell carcinoma into histologically mature teratoma. These lesions typically have a benign clinical course. The authors present a case of leiomyosarcoma occurring within such a lesion. It arose 18 years after therapy for metastatic embryonal carcinoma of the testis and appears to have been radiation induced. 
Embolization of cardiac myxomas masquerading as polyarteritis nodosa. Cardiac myxomas are rare tumors which can mimic other diseases. We describe a 19-year-old man who presented clinically with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Muscle biopsy showed vasculitis, but corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was initially effective. Cardiac myxomas were found by echocardiogram when the disease relapsed and were resected surgically. Segmental arterial aneurysms and stenoses were found on angiography after leg ischemia. We suggest that echocardiography should be performed in all cases of clinically suspected PAN. 
Streptococcus salivarius meningitis and colonic carcinoma. Streptococcus salivarius caused fulminant meningitis in an elderly patient. A gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an asymptomatic colonic adenocarcinoma. This first reported instance of S salivarius sepsis associated with a colonic neoplasm is not unexpected, since the organism is bacteriologically similar to S bovis, the prime bacterial indicator of occult malignancy. Exact speciation of streptococcal strains is fraught with technical difficulties, and gastrointestinal investigation may be warranted in an expanded variety of streptococcal infections. 
Acute bronchitis in children: building a clinical definition. Much about acute bronchitis in children is uncertain, even its definition. This study was undertaken to help build a clinical definition to serve as a guide for further research. Charts of 180 children 1 to 12 years old were reviewed. Each had received a diagnosis of acute bronchitis (54 patients), upper respiratory infection with a cough (128 patients), or a new diagnosis of asthma (26 patients) during the previous 12 months. A history of sputum production (odds ration 25.0, p = 0.0001), the finding of rales or rhonchi on examination (OR 11.6, p less than 0.0001), and a past history of lower respiratory illness (OR 3.0, p = 0.01) were associated with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, but fever and duration of illness were not. In addition, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis was strongly associated with a prescription for an antibiotic. In a child with a cough, acute bronchitis is more likely to be diagnosed if there is a history of sputum production, rales or rhonchi on examination, and a past history of lower respiratory disease. 
Shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones: results and 12-month follow-up in 174 patients. At the authors' institution, as part of the on-going Dornier National Biliary Lithotripsy Study, 174 patients with gallstones were randomly assigned to receive either ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or placebo for 6 months after undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Six weeks after ESWL, 40 (23%) patients were re-treated for gallstone fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter. No significant difference in the UDCA- and placebo-treated patients was noted. The overall 6- and 12-month stone-free rates for all patients with initially noncalcified stones were as follows: UDCA patients, 31% and 36%, respectively, and placebo patients, 21% and 23%, respectively (P less than .05). In patients with a single, noncalcified gallstone that was at most 20 mm in diameter, the 12-month stone-free rates were as follows: UDCA patients, 60%, and placebo patients, 33% (P less than .01). Patients with noncalcified stones that were 11-20 mm in diameter who were treated with UDCA had a higher rate of stone clearance than placebo patients. At 6 months, the authors' previous study demonstrated no significant difference in the two groups of patients. However, the stone-free rate at 12 months was noted to be significantly higher for patients with a single, noncalcified stone that was at most 20 mm in diameter begun on UDCA than for all other groups of patients. 
In vivo thrombin inhibition enhances and sustains arterial recanalization with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. The effects of heparin and the synthetic competitive thrombin inhibitor (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfon yl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrate (Argatroban) on thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in groups of six or seven rabbits with arterial thrombosis. The model consisted of a whole-blood clot produced in a 1-cm isolated femoral arterial segment with superimposed endothelial damage and distal high-grade stenosis. rt-PA was injected as an intravenous bolus of 0.45 mg/kg body wt at 15-minute intervals until recanalization, or up to a maximum of four boluses. In seven rabbits given an intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg aspirin, rt-PA induced transient reflow in only one animal. In seven rabbits that received intravenous heparin (200 units/kg over 60 minutes), rt-PA administration produced reflow in five animals, which was persistent in two rabbits. Combined administration of aspirin and heparin in seven rabbits was associated with similar rt-PA-induced recanalization. rt-PA administration in six rabbits given intravenous Argatroban (100 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes) caused recanalization in five, with persistent patency in three. In six rabbits given aspirin and Argatroban, rt-PA caused recanalization in all, with persistent patency in five animals. Reflow occurred significantly more rapidly with Argatroban (14 +/- 7 minutes) than with heparin (35 +/- 11 minutes), reflow was obtained with fewer boluses of rt-PA in combination with Argatroban (median value of one bolus) than with heparin (median value, three boluses), and reocclusion after reflow was less frequent with Argatroban (0 of 11 versus 5 of 10 rabbits). Furthermore, the degree of thrombolysis determined by pathological analysis was significantly more extensive with Argatroban than with heparin, and patency persisted during a 3-hour observation period, despite elimination of Argatroban from the circulation. Thus, Argatroban, relative to heparin, enhances and sustains thrombolysis with rt-PA. It may offer promise as an adjunctive agent for thrombolytic therapy of arterial thrombosis. 
The use of color flow mapping for intraoperative assessment of valve repair. Repair procedures that preserve a patient's native valve are associated with a lower perioperative and late mortality, a lower incidence of thromboembolic events, and better preservation of left ventricular function than prosthetic replacement. Traditionally employed procedures for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of repair, such as fluid injection into the arrested ventricle for assessment of valve leakage, measurement of atrial pressure and height of V-waves, and palpation of the atria for the presence of systolic thrills, have not proved to be reliable approaches in the intraoperative evaluation of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and in the assessment of the adequacy of repair procedures. Intraoperative color Doppler, using either the epicardial or the transesophageal approach, offers rapid and accurate information about the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation at the time of surgery. This technique provides instantaneous evaluation of the adequacy of mitral and tricuspid valvuloplasty and appears capable of predicting postoperative outcome. Intraoperative color Doppler is useful for evaluation of the adequacy of repair before chest closure and may thus help to avoid the need for reoperation. This approach may ultimately allow valve repair procedures to be performed in greater numbers of patients with better control over outcome and with lower reoperation rates. 
Histological diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in patients with AIDS. Fifty nine patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diarrhoea and 20 with weight loss were investigated for microsporidiosis using light and electron microscopical examination of duodenal and jejunal biopsy specimens. Eight cases of microsporidiosis were found, in five of whom it was the sole pathogen. In all eight cases the organism was identified at light microscopy without prior knowledge of the electron microscopical findings. All stages of the life cycle are best seen in resin sections cut at 1 micron and stained with Giemsa, but spores could easily be identified in paraffin sections cut at 5 microns and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. In all cases the parasite was identified both in duodenal pinch and jejunal "Crosby" capsule biopsy specimens. All cases of microsporidiosis occurred in patients with diarrhoea. Both electron and light microscopical examination suggested that the pathogenic mechanism involves the shedding of infected enterocytes containing large numbers of spores. It is suggested that the optimal way to diagnose microsporidiosis is by light microscopical examination of duodenal pinch biopsy specimens. 
Spontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. 
Fluid distribution and pulmonary dysfunction following burn shock. Respiratory function and body fluid changes were measured in 46 burned patients for up to 7 days postburn (DPB). The patients in this prospective study were divided into an HLS group [n = 17, burn size 61 +/- 0.5% BSA (mean +/- SEM), resuscitated with hypertonic lactated saline] and an iso-Na group (n = 29, burn size 60 +/- 4.5% BSA, resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution). During DPB 3 to 5, the Respiratory Index (A-aDO2/PaO2), functional extracellular fluid volume (f-ECFV), an ratio of plasma volume to interstitial fluid volume (PV/ISFV) were increased in the iso-Na group compared with the HLS group. During the same period, the Respiratory Index and PV/ISFV correlated significantly; respiratory dysfunction was less in the HLS group. Nearly 50% of the iso-Na group required endotracheal intubation. Sodium loads were the same in both groups; the HLS group required less water. These results suggest that extracellular fluid distribution differs between the two treatments; HLS may be associated with ameliorated respiratory function not only because of less volume loading during resuscitation, but also because the PV/ISFV ratio is less than when lactated Ringer's is administered. 
Carotid baroreceptor function in dogs with chronic norepinephrine infusion. Carotid baroreceptor function, the compliance of the carotid sinus wall, and the structure of the carotid artery were examined in dogs with elevated plasma norepinephrine (2,000-4,000 pg/ml) for 28 days. The dogs with high norepinephrine were normotensive (100 +/- 4.0 versus 98 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; p greater than 0.05) with bradycardia (65 +/- 4.0 versus 87 +/- 16 beats/min; p less than 0.05) compared with normal dogs in the conscious state. However, after pentobarbital anesthesia blood pressure was significantly higher in dogs with chronic norepinephrine infusion (165 +/- 6 mm Hg) compared with normal dogs (132 +/- 6 mm Hg). To assess baroreceptor sensitivity, multiunit carotid baroreceptor activity was recorded from the right carotid sinus nerve, and the carotid sinus wall compliance (sonomicrometers) was measured during nitroglycerin and phenylephrine injections. The threshold and saturation pressures increased from 96 +/- 3.9 to 117 +/- 4.2 mm Hg and from 145 +/- 4.3 to 171 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, respectively, in the normal dogs compared with the high norepinephrine dogs. The most striking differences were the marked increases in sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors (0.47 +/- 0.05 versus 1.99 +/- 0.45 spikes.sec-1.mm Hg-1; p less than 0.01) and maximum firing frequency of the baroreceptors (24 +/- 3.1 versus 48 +/- 4.4 spikes/sec; p less than 0.01), whereas the carotid sinus wall compliance was unchanged (0.014 +/- 0.003 versus 0.012 +/- 0.002 mm/mm Hg; p greater than 0.05). Similar alterations were observed using single fiber recordings, that is, an increase in threshold and saturation pressures and slope of baroreceptor units in dogs with elevated norepinephrine. The wall thickness and area of the carotid artery were determined. Both increased significantly (0.77 +/- 0.06 versus 1.30 +/- 0.12 mm and 9.0 +/- 0.8 versus 11.9 +/- 0.9 mm2; p less than 0.05) in dogs chronically infused with norepinephrine while the dry weight-to-wet weight ratio of left carotid artery tissue also increased from 26.0 +/- 0.73% to 29.0 +/- 0.57%. These studies indicate that 1) one of the possible mechanisms responsible for bradycardia in the conscious dogs with high norepinephrine is enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors; 2) the enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors is not due to a change in compliance of the carotid sinus wall; and 3) chronic elevation of norepinephrine causes hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the wall of the common carotid artery. 
A unique mutation in the vitamin D receptor gene in three Japanese patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type II: utility of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for heterozygous carrier detection. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II is a hereditary disease resulting from a defective vitamin D receptor. In three Japanese patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type II whose fibroblasts displayed normal cytosol binding and impaired nuclear uptake of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, western, Southern, and northern analyses failed to disclose any abnormalities in vitamin D3 receptor protein and its gene. Exons 2 and 3 of the vitamin D receptor cDNA, which encode the DNA-binding domain consisting of two zinc fingers, were amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the specific mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene. In the three patients and one normal control a T-to-C transition was found in the putative initiation codon, while this transition was not observed in another normal control. This finding suggested that an original initiation codon was located at positions 10-12 in the human vitamin D receptor cDNA sequence reported previously. In contrast, a unique G-to-A transition at position 140 in exon 3, resulting in substitution of arginine by glutamine at residue 47, was revealed only in these three patients. The arginine at 47 is located between two zinc fingers and is conserved within all steroid hormone receptors. Therefore, it is highly conceivable that this amino acid substitution is responsible for the defect of the vitamin D receptor in the patients. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified DNA confirmed that all patients were homozygous and that parents from one family were heterozygous carriers for this mutation. 
Patients admitted to the emergency room with symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. All 7157 patients (55% men) admitted to the emergency room with chest pain or other symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction during a period of 21 months were registered consecutively. Chest pain was reported by 93% of the patients. On the basis of history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram in the emergency room, all patients were prospectively classified in one of four categories: (i) obvious infarction (4% of all patients); (ii) strongly suspected infarction (20%); (iii) vague suspicion of infarction (35%); and (iv) no suspected infarction (41%). In patients with no suspected infarction (n = 2910), musculoskeletal (26%), obscure (21%) and psychogenic origins (16%) of the symptoms occurred most frequently. We conclude that few of the patients had an obvious infarction on admission, and that a musculoskeletal origin of the symptoms occurred most frequently in patients with no suspected infarction. 
Maintenance therapy with sucralfate in duodenal ulcer: genuine prevention or accelerated healing of ulcer recurrence? We sought to compare the efficacy of sucralfate to placebo for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence and to determine that the efficacy of sucralfate was due to a true reduction in ulcer prevalence and not due to secondary effects such as analgesic activity or accelerated healing. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multicenter clinical study with 254 patients. All patients had a past history of at least two duodenal ulcers with at least one ulcer diagnosed by endoscopic examination 3 months or less before the start of the study. Complete ulcer healing without erosions was required to enter the study. Sucralfate or placebo were dosed as a 1-g tablet twice a day for 4 months, or until ulcer recurrence. Endoscopic examinations once a month and when symptoms developed determined the presence or absence of duodenal ulcers. If a patient developed an ulcer between monthly scheduled visits, the patient was dosed with a 1-g sucralfate tablet twice a day until the next scheduled visit. Statistical analyses of the results determined the efficacy of sucralfate compared with placebo for preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence. Comparisons of therapeutic agents for preventing duodenal ulcers have usually been made by testing for statistical differences in the cumulative rates for all ulcers developed during a follow-up period, regardless of the time of detection. Statistical experts at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and on the FDA Advisory Panel expressed doubts about clinical study results based on this type of analysis. They suggested three possible mechanisms for reducing the number of observed ulcers: (a) analgesic effects, (b) accelerated healing, and (c) true ulcer prevention. Traditional ulcer analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to an analgesic effect or accelerated healing. Point-prevalence analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to accelerated healing between endoscopic examinations. Maximum ulcer analyses, a novel statistical method, eliminated analgesic effects by regularly scheduled endoscopies and accelerated healing of recurring ulcers by frequent endoscopies and an open-label phase. Maximum ulcer analysis reflects true ulcer recurrence and prevention. Sucralfate was significantly superior to placebo in reducing ulcer prevalence by all analyses. Significance (p less than 0.05) was found at months 3 and 4 for all analyses. All months were significant in the traditional analysis, months 2-4 in point-prevalence analysis, and months 3-4 in the maximal ulcer prevalence analysis. Sucralfate was shown to be effective for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence by a true reduction in new ulcer development. 
Predicting the outcomes of electrophysiologic studies of patients with unexplained syncope: preliminary validation of a derived model. PURPOSE: To develop and validate a predictive model that would allow clinicians to determine whether an electrophysiologic (EP) study is likely to result in useful diagnostic information for a patient who has unexplained syncope. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent EP studies at two university medical centers comprised the training sample. A test sample to validate the model was made up of 138 patients from the clinical literature who had undergone EP studies for syncope. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing EP studies for syncope. The data collector was blinded to the study hypothesis; the electrophysiologist assessing outcomes was blinded to clinical and historical data. Clinical predictor variables available from the history, the physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and Holter monitoring were analyzed via two multivariable predictive modeling strategies (ordinal logistic regression and recursive partitioning) for their abilities to predict the results of EP studies, namely tachyarrhythmic and bradyarrhythmic outcomes. These categories were further divided into full arrhythmia and borderline arrhythmia groups. RESULTS: Important outcomes were 1) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2) bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conducting disease. The results of the logistic regression (in this study, the superior strategy) showed that the presence of organic heart disease [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, p less than 0.001] and frequent premature ventricular contractions on ECG (OR = 6.7, p less than 0.004) were associated with VT, while the following abnormal ECG findings were associated with bradyarrhythmias: first-degree heart block (OR = 7.9, p less than 0.001), bundle-branch block (OR = 3.0, p less than 0.02), and sinus bradycardia (OR = 3.5, p less than 0.03). Eighty-seven percent of the 31 patients with important outcomes at EP study had at least one of these clinical risk factors, while 95% of the patients with none of these risk factors had normal or nondiagnostic EP studies. In the validation sample, the presence of one or more risk factors would have correctly identified 88% of the test VT patients and 65% of the test bradyarrhythmia patients as needing EP study. CONCLUSION: These five identified predictive factors, available from the history, the physical examination, and the initial ECG, could be useful to clinicians in selecting those patients with unexplained syncope who will have a serious arrhythmia identified by EP studies. 
Early abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
Treatment failure of genital condylomata acuminata in women: role of the male sexual partner. The male sexual partners of women with genital condylomata acuminata are thought to be carriers of human papillomaviruses. It is therefore often recommended that both sexual partners be treated. We studied 360 women with genital warts to test the hypothesis that when the male partners of women with condylomata acuminata are treated, the treatment failure rate decreases. The male sexual partners of 180 of these women were examined and, if indicated, treated (treatment group). The 180 remaining male sexual partners were neither examined nor treated (control group). One hundred twenty-two (68%) men in the treatment group had human papillomavirus-associated lesions. The treatment failure rate of women was 16.7% in the treatment group and 18.9% in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the treatment failure rate of women with condylomata acuminata decreases if their male sexual partners are also treated. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
Encephalo-myelo-radiculo-ganglionitis presenting as pandysautonomia. A 68-year-old man developed pandysautonomia with severe orthostatic dysfunction, fixed heart rate, low serum levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, absent sympathetic skin responses, and pupillary abnormalities. CSF protein was 92 mg/dl. In spite of a good recovery following corticosteroid administration, a relapse occurred, with accompanying sensory symptoms confined to both arms. Fatal sudden cardiac arrest occurred after 4 months. Autopsy revealed numerous lymphocytic infiltrates, predominantly in autonomic and sensory ganglia and, to a lesser extent, in the nerve roots, spinal cord, and brainstem without evidence for an underlying tumor. This case provides histopathologic evidence for an inflammatory etiology of panautonomic neuropathy in some patients. 
Value of serum alkaline phosphatase and radionuclide bone scans in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Ninety-one patients who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were reviewed to determine the prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels and radionuclide bone scan. A preoperative SAP greater than 127 IU/L was a strong indicator of eventual disease progression or death, and an elevated SAP was a better predictor of eventual outcome than bone scan. 
Poikilothermia in man: pathophysiology and clinical implications. Poikilothermia, the inability to maintain a constant core temperature independent of ambient temperature, markedly influences both the mental and physical function of affected patients; furthermore, prolonged hypothermia can induce numerous complications. To establish the pathophysiology of thermoregulation underlying poikilothermia in man, we compared 4 women with acquired poikilothermia, with 9 female control subjects. The activity of the main thermoregulatory effector mechanisms was assessed in a thermoneutral environment, and during subsequent cold stress and heat exposure. At thermoneutrality the patients had a significantly lower rectal temperature and resting metabolic rate compared with the controls; no patient showed peripheral vasoconstriction or shivering. Cooling revealed markedly reduced peripheral vasoconstriction in 3 patients and failure of the metabolic response in 2 patients; unlike controls, no patient exhibited shivering. Heat challenge revealed severely reduced capacity for heat dissipation in all patients. We conclude that in patients with poikilothermia, the mechanisms for both heat conservation and heat dissipation are seriously attenuated. Careful monitoring of the core temperature and adequate measures to maintain normothermia are of great importance in patients with poikilothermia in order to provide adequate treatment, improve the quality of life, and prevent serious complications. 
Second radical neck dissection. We report a series of 96 patients (62 men and 34 women) undergoing a second radical neck dissection for enlarged contralateral cervical nodes after primary treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, including an ipsilateral radical neck dissection. The proportion of patients requiring a second later neck dissection varied from 0% for tumours of the nasopharynx, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, to 5% for tumours of the hypopharynx. The incidence of second neck dissection was not determined by the original T stage of the primary tumour, but patients with enlarged nodes at presentation were 5 times more likely to need a second neck dissection than those with no palpable nodes at presentation. Also, patients with a poorly differentiated tumour were twice as likely to need a second neck dissection as those with a well differentiated tumour. The overall 5-year survival after second neck dissection was 35% and the perioperative mortality 1.92%. Significant factors predicting survival after a second neck dissection were the time to recurrence, the clinical neck node status at recurrence, the number of histologically invaded nodes in the neck and the presence of extra-nodal disease. 
Temporal arteritis: an atypical presentation. Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis primarily involving branches of the carotid arteries in patients aged 50 years and greater. Its classic symptoms and signs are headache and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but this is not the only presentation. This case is the first reported in a Korean, whose chief complaint was pain in the tongue and headaches and whose ESR was normal. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Her symptoms abated when treated with prednisone, but she developed diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and compression fracture of lumbar vertebrae while being treated. Primary physicians should become aware of the atypical features of this disease, as well as the potential complications of treatment. 
Coronary bypass surgery improves global and regional left ventricular function following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. Coronary bypass surgery was performed prior to hospital discharge in 303 (22%) of 1387 consecutive patients enrolled in the TAMI 1 to 3 and 5 trials of intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Bypass surgery was of emergency nature (less than 24 hours from treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy) in 36 (2.6%) and was deferred (greater than 24 hours) in 267 (19.3%) patients. The indications for bypass surgery included failed angioplasty (12%); left main or equivalent coronary disease (9%); complex or multivessel coronary disease (62%); recurrent postinfarction angina (13%); and refractory pump dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture or abnormal predischarge functional test (1% each). Although patients having bypass surgery were older (59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 56.0 +/- 10.2 years, (p less than 0.0001), had more extensive coronary artery disease (46% with three-vessel disease versus 11%, (p less than 0.0001), had more frequent diabetes mellitus (19% versus 15%, (p = 0.048), had more prior infarctions (p less than 0.0001), had more severe initial depression in global left ventricular ejection fraction (48.0 +/- 11.9% versus 51.8 +/- 11.9%, p = 0.0002), and regional infarct zone (-2.7 +/- 0.94 versus -2.5 +/- 1.1 SD/chord, p = 0.02) and noninfarct zone function (-0.36 +/- 1.8 versus 0.43 +/- 1.6 SD/chord, p less than 0.0001) than patients not having coronary bypass surgery, no difference in the incidence of death in hospital (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) or death at long-term follow-up of hospital survivors (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) was noted between groups. Surgical patients demonstrated a greater degree of recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.4 +/- 9.8% versus 0.16 +/- 8.5%, p = 0.036) and infarct zone regional function (0.71 +/- 1.1 versus 0.34 +/- 0.99 SD/chord, p = 0.001) when immediate (90 minutes following initiation of thrombolytic therapy) and predischarge (7 to 14 days after treatment) contrast left ventriculograms were compared than did patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic therapy with or without coronary angioplasty. These data suggest a beneficial influence of coronary bypass surgery on left ventricular function and possibly on the clinical outcome of patients initially treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
The endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486). Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities. We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer. 
Septic shock and multiple organ failure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and mortality rates of septic shock in ICU patients and the clinical course of multiple organ failure associated with septic shock. DESIGN: Retrospective case survey. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: During a 2-yr period, 2,469 consecutive intensive care patients were studied regarding the frequency and hospital mortality rates of septic shock. A subset of 1,311 patients was further analyzed for the occurrence of organ system failures within 48 hrs of the onset of septic shock and again 4 to 7 days later. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency rate of septic shock was 1.9% (n = 48), with a mortality rate of 72.9% (n = 35) in patients with septic shock. Deaths due to septic shock represented 14.6% of all deaths in the ICU during the study period. Eighteen patients died within 72 hrs of the onset of septic shock. Refractory hypotension was the cause of death in 15 of these 18 patients. Beyond 72 hrs, multiple organ failure accounted for eight of 17 deaths. The mean +/- SD number of organ systems failing at 48 hrs was 3.3 +/- 1.3 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.1 in nonsurvivors, and at 4 to 7 days was 2.1 +/- 1.5 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.5 in nonsurvivors (p less than .05). None of the specific organ system failures had prognostic value. The number of organ system failures was not related to the duration of hypotension, but had a weak correlation (r2 = .26, p less than .05) with the duration of vasoactive treatment at 4 to 7 days. The prolonged need for norepinephrine therapy was associated with an increased occurrence of renal failure. Thirty (62.5%) patients had positive blood cultures and a mortality rate similar to the mortality rate of patients with negative blood cultures. Patients with negative blood cultures died more often with hypotension (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock is a major cause of death in intensive care patients. Refractory hypotension is a main cause of early deaths. Later on, multiple organ failure becomes the primary clinical problem and cause of mortality. 
Duplex ultrasound in the assessment of vascular disease in clinical hypertension. Duplex ultrasound combines B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler flow analysis and is rapidly becoming the most useful and widely applied method for the evaluation of atherosclerotic arterial disease. Recent technical improvements including color flow Doppler allow its application to practically all vascular beds in the body. Duplex is noninvasive and in many areas its accuracy in the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion rivals angiography. Duplex ultrasound has become the preferred method of evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. It provides information about the degree of stenosis, location of disease, and plaque characterization, and in many cases replaces standard cerebral arteriography. Duplex ultrasound has been used to detect renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension with an accuracy of 93% in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant stenosis. It also has important applications in the assessment of mesenteric artery stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, and venous disease. Because it is accurate, reasonably inexpensive, and noninvasive, duplex ultrasound can be used to follow the progression of untreated atherosclerotic lesions throughout the body. Used in this fashion, it provides important information about the natural history of atherosclerotic lesions, their clinical prognosis, and the effect of interventions, either medical or surgical, on lesions. 
Granulocytic sarcoma of the ovary. An unusual case presentation. We report an unusual occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an ovarian mass in a 46-year-old woman with a history of dysplastic nevus syndrome. During workup of the ovarian mass, the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was made. A fine-needle aspirate of the ovarian mass showed granulocytic sarcoma. The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later. A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma. Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy. Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology. The association between dysplastic nevus syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in this case is discussed with reference to a review of the metachronous association between melanoma and leukemia as described in the literature. 
Antigen-provoked increase in histamine reactivity. Observations on mechanisms. To investigate the effect of antigen provocation on nonspecific reactivity to histamine, nine allergic individuals underwent multiple nasal challenges with histamine, or antigen. The response to challenge was assessed by counting the number of sneezes and measuring the levels of albumin and TAME-esterase (TAME; [3H]N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester) activity in recovered nasal lavages. In the case of antigen, levels of histamine were also measured. In response to histamine, the subjects sneezed and had increased levels of albumin and TAME. The responses to antigen or histamine were unchanged 24 h after histamine provocation. The responses to histamine provocations were increased with respect to symptom scores and to the levels of TAME activity and albumin in nasal lavages compared to baseline challenge, however, 24 h after antigen provocation. Increasing antigen exposure from 1 to 3 days did not further increase the responsiveness to histamine. Histamine reactivity returned to baseline 12 days after antigen exposure. The number of eosinophils, neutrophils, and alcian blue-positive cells in the lavages after antigen challenge and before the histamine challenges correlated with the changes in response to histamine. The increase in sneezing induced by antigen stimulation correlated with the increase in the same parameter after histamine provocation 24 hr after antigen challenge (r = 0.88; p less than 0.01). Surprisingly, the other parameters assessed did not show similar correlations. 
Capnography for detection of endobronchial migration of an endotracheal tube. A patient is described in whom migration of an endotracheal tube into the right main bronchus was suspected when end-tidal carbon dioxide suddenly decreased from 28 to 22 mm Hg. Acute changes with migration of the endotracheal tube into the main bronchus were also studied in an animal experimental model. End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased and tracheal (inflation) pressure increased, with no change in tidal volume. Arterial blood gases showed time-dependent decreases in pH and oxygen tension and an increase in carbon dioxide tension. 
Treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan. The Subcutaneous Sumatriptan International Study Group BACKGROUND. The headache in migraine attacks may be caused by dilatation of certain cranial arteries or arteriovenous anastomoses, by neurogenic dural plasma extravasation, or by both of these mechanisms. Sumatriptan, a novel selective agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine-like receptors, blocks these phenomena. We investigated its efficacy in migraine. METHODS. We studied 639 patients with migraine attacks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. We assessed the effect of subcutaneous injections of 6 or 8 mg of sumatriptan or placebo on the severity of headache and associated migrane symptoms 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment. Patients who were not free of pain after 60 minutes subsequently received placebo if they had initially received placebo or 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo if they had initially received 6 mg of sumatriptan. RESULTS. After 60 minutes, the severity of headache was decreased in 72 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 68 to 76 percent) of the 422 patients given 6 mg of sumatriptan, 79 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 71 to 87 percent) of the 109 patients given 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 33 percent) of the 105 patients given placebo (data on 3 patients could not be evaluated). As compared with the placebo group, 47 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 38 to 57 percent) more patients who had received 6 mg of sumatriptan and 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 65 percent) more patients who had received 8 mg of sumatriptan had a decrease in the severity of headache (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). After 120 minutes, 86 to 92 percent of the 511 patients treated with sumatriptan (202 assigned to 6 mg plus placebo, 203 to 6 mg plus 6 mg, and 106 to 8 mg plus placebo) had improvement in the severity of headache, as compared with only 37 percent of the 104 patients who received placebo once or twice (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Twenty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because of missing data (19) or protocol violations (2). The response rates did not differ significantly among the sumatriptan regimens. Adverse events were minor and transient in all groups. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan given subcutaneously is a highly effective, rapid-acting, and well-tolerated treatment for migrane attacks. The administration of a second dose 60 minutes later to patients not responding well to an initial dose affords little additional benefit. 
Evaluation of neck lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma We studied a series of 150 patients treated for thoracic esophageal carcinoma at our institution. The patients were divided into two matched groups. Group B underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy only; group A also underwent bilateral neck lymph node dissection. The rates of operative mortality and operative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. The 5-year survival rate was 38.7% overall (48.7% in group A and 33.7% in group B). Group A had a significantly better survival curve than group B. Twenty patients (26.0%) in group A had metastasis in the dissected neck lymph nodes. The 4-year survival rate of these patients was 47.9%. The significantly better survival of group A and the satisfactory prognosis in the patients with positive cervical lymph nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of neck lymph node dissection in radical operation for thoracic esophageal carcinoma. 
Helicobacter pylori infection in intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas [published erratum appears in J Natl Cancer Inst 1991 Jun 19;83(12):881] Gastric cancer can be divided into two histologic types: intestinal and diffuse. To determine whether Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium linked with gastritis, was associated with either cancer type, we reviewed histologic sections from stomachs of patients who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Of 37 of the sections with evidence of intestinal-type cancer, 33 (89.2%) contained H pylori in noncancerous tissue compared with 7 (31.8%) of 22 of the sections with evidence of diffuse-type cancer (odds ratio = 17.7; P less than .001). This association remained strong when controlled for age, sex, site, and number of sections reviewed. The prevalence of H pylori in intestinal-type gastric cancer far exceeded the prevalence of H pylori in diffuse disease and that described in the normal US population. This finding suggests that H pylori may be a cofactor in development of intestinal-type gastric cancer. 
Coronary angioplasty in single-vessel complex lesions: short- and long-term outcome and factors predicting acute coronary occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of complex coronary lesions (plaque ulceration and/or thrombus) has an increased risk of procedural complications. To assess the influence of these angiographic features on immediate and long-term results of PTCA, we prospectively compared the success rate, incidence of procedural complications, and restenosis rate in two groups of patients selected on the basis of the presence (study group = 30 patients) or absence (control group = 200 patients) of complex morphology at the time of angioplasty. The two groups were similar with regard to extent of coronary artery disease and site of coronary stenosis. Patients in the study group had a higher incidence of periprocedural acute coronary occlusion (47% vs 6%; p less than 0.01), which in 78% of the cases was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty and intracoronary thrombolysis. Univariate correlates of this complication were Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV (57% vs 19%; p less than 0.05) and recent (less than 30 days) onset of worsening of symptoms (71% vs 31%; p less than 0.05). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly higher in the study group (6.7% vs 2%; p = NS), and the success rate with redilatation was the same (90%). Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained from all patients in whom the procedure was successful; the restenosis rate was 55% in the study group compared with 36% in the control group (p less than 0.05). 
Characterization of refractory period extension by transcardiac shock. BACKGROUND. To better understand the refractory period extension (RPE) produced by transcardiac shocks and its possible role in defibrillation, we measured RPE under various experimental conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using ventricular pacing in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, we characterized RPE in relation to the anatomic site of pacing, the local voltage gradient (LVG) produced by the shocks at the pacing site, and the pacing rate and pacing current used to make the measurements. We also determined if RPE persisted into the next refractory period after the shock and measured RPE at the end of 30-second episodes of acute ischemia to the pacing site, which were caused by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Each anatomic site tested showed RPE, which increased sharply with increasing LVG at lower levels but less sharply at higher LVG. The RPE versus LVG was approximated with an exponential curve that had an exponential constant of about 5-6 V/cm. At faster pacing rates, RPE occurred earlier in the refractory period but was unchanged when expressed as a percent increase of refractory period. RPE did not vary with the pacing current and was present only in the refractory period during which the shock was delivered. The RPE was not significantly altered by acute ischemia. These results show that transcardiac shocks selectively extend the refractory period of tissue proportional to the LVG and the timing of the shock in the refractory period. They are consistent with the concept that RPE prevents depolarization from tissue directly excited by a shock from propagating to tissue that was refractory to that same shock. CONCLUSIONS. The insensitivity of RPE to short ischemic episodes and the presence of RPE at increased activation rates suggest that RPE might exist under conditions of fibrillation and be a major determinant of the success or failure of defibrillation. 
Myocardial calcifications in neonates and infants: a unique tissue reaction. The deposit of calcium salts into myocardial cells represents the process of dystrophic calcification. Once it causes alterations in cellular calcium hemostasis, it can initiate deleterious events leading to ischemic myocardial injury and cell death. Myocardial calcifications in infants are markedly different from those in adults; calcifications are significantly more frequent in cases of myocardial necrosis in the young, and can be demonstrated microscopically without removal of necrotic fibers and scar formation, which are the adult's usual stages of response to myocardial necrosis. Important functional and clinical implications in myocardial calcification, other than serving as a marker for necrosis, relate to accelerated myocardial calcification after cardiac surgery in infants. 
Pubovaginal fascial sling for the treatment of complicated stress urinary incontinence. We reviewed retrospectively 67 consecutive women with complicated stress incontinence who underwent a pubovaginal fascial sling procedure by a single surgeon. A detailed micturition questionnaire was completed at the last followup, which ranged from 1 to 8 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. Postoperatively, 82% of the women claimed that they were never incontinent and never wore pads, while 9% were incontinent less often than once per 2 weeks and 9% 9% continued to have troublesome incontinence on a daily basis. Only 2 of these women had persistent stress incontinence; the remainder (5) had urge incontinence. In 6 patients with a neurogenic bladder postoperative urinary retention was expected and they were treated with intermittent self-catheterization. Two patients had urethral obstruction by the sling and required prolonged (probably permanent) intermittent self-catheterization. 
Cholestasis without cirrhosis alters regulatory liver gene expression and inhibits hepatic regeneration. Partial hepatectomy (PH) initiates cellular signals for regeneration. Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture. Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration, the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation, differentiation, and regulatory gene expression are unknown. To examine this, 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division. A 47% +/- 5% PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis. Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values, cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH, compared with livers after PH alone. Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11% +/- 5.2% compared with 40% +/- 4.3% in control livers (+/- SEM; p less than 0.001) 5 days after PH. Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal, sustained elevation of K-ras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points. Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in H-ras found in control livers. The expression of c-myc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH. These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of c-myc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis. This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression, inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Cardiac biopsy in patients with "primary" atrial fibrillation. Histologic evidence of occult myocardial diseases. Fourteen patients (ten men and four women; mean age, 37 years) with lone atrial fibrillation (AF) (1 to 18 months' duration) were evaluated by thyroid function tests, two-dimensional echocardiography, hemodynamics, coronary angiography, and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, because of unresponsiveness to the usual antiarrhythmic therapy. The results of the T3, T4, TSH, and TRH tests were normal in all patients; cardiac valves and ventricular and atrial sizes (left atrium less than 40 mm) were within the normal limits; also normal were LVEDP (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) and EF (greater than 0.50). Histologic findings were abnormal in all cases, with three patients showing cardiomyopathic changes, three other patients showing active myocarditis (lymphocytic in two and eosinophilic in one), and eight patients with nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis or both. Steroids (prednisone; 50 mg/m2 of body surface area daily) used in addition to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with eosinophilic and lymphocytic active myocarditis were able to cause reversion to sinus rhythm, while the other patients continued to have AF. This study documents that occult myocardial diseases (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis) can underlie "primary" AF. The addition of steroids to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with refractory AF and histologic evidence of active myocarditis seems to be useful in controlling the arrhythmia. 
Results of multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in persons aged 65 years and older. Between 1981 and 1990, 1,373 patients, aged greater than or equal to 65 years (mean 71.2 +/- 4.9), underwent 1,640 multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. Of these, 224 patients (13.6%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, 412 (25.1%) had prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 48 (2.9%) had left main artery dilatation. Of the 1,640 PTCA procedures, 697 were in patients with 2-vessel disease and 943 were in patients with 3-vessel disease. A mean 3.5 lesions were dilated per patient, with an overall angiographic success rate of 96%. Complete revascularization was achieved in 857 (52%). A total of 52 patients (3.2%) had a major in-hospital complication: 27 patients (1.6%) died, 24 (1.4%) had a Q-wave myocardial infarction, and 14 (0.8%) underwent emergent CABG. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (p less than or equal to 0.001), 3-vessel disease (p less than or equal to 0.01), female gender (p less than or equal to 0.02), and PTCA between 1981 and 1985 (p less than or equal to 0.05) as independent predictors of mortality. Of the 1,373 patients, 1,023 have been followed for greater than or equal to 1 year (mean follow-up 32.5 +/- 21.3 months). There were 156 (15.2%) late deaths, 81 (7.9%) recurrent myocardial infarctions, and 162 (15.8%) coronary artery bypass operations. Actuarial survival, computed from the time of hospital discharge, was 92% at 1 year, 86% at 3 years and 78% at 5 years. Repeat PTCA was required in 371 patients (36.3%). 
Multiple swallow test for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of esophageal motility disorders Esophageal motility was evaluated from the analysis of six consecutive swallows. A sum image was generated comprising the representative information of an entire study. Calculation of emptying rates and characterization of the bolus behavior was performed from the sum image and the single swallow data. In 86 patients investigated, liquid and solid-phase studies showed a remarkable variation of single swallow data in normals (relative variation coefficient for liquid: 10%, solid: 14%), which were even higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with disorders (liquid: 31%, solid: 25%). As sum images compensate for this intra-individual variation, false-positive (liquid: 16%, solid: 25%) or negative single swallow findings (liquid: 36%, solid: 27%) are reduced. Qualitative analysis of condensed sum images provided characteristic image patterns representing different pathophysiologic aspects. Since the method introduced better discriminates between normal and pathologic function, it may enhance diagnostic accuracy. 
Selective versus routine predischarge coronary arteriography after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. TIMI II Investigators. To ascertain whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge coronary arteriography (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1,461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine coronary arteriography unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, coronary arteriography was performed in 93.9% of the routine catheterization group and 34.7% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar in the two groups (24.4% versus 20.7%, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 60%) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73.1%, selective catheterization group 61.3%). During the 1st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of coronary arteriography were more common in the selective catheterization group (37.9% versus 27.6%, p = 0.007 and 28.6% versus 11.6%, p less than 0.001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, coronary arteriography had been performed one or more times in 98.9% of the routine catheterization group and 59.4% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10.2% versus 7.0% (p = 0.10) and 8.6% versus 9.0% (p = 0.87), respectively. Because the selective coronary arteriography policy exposes about 40% fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy. 
Results of fundoplication in a UK paediatric centre. Of 55 children (age 3 months to 16 years) who had fundoplication, major complications occurred in nine (16 per cent): paraoesophageal hernia (five cases), prolonged ileus (two cases), recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux (one case), and accidental perforation (one case). The single most important factor resulting in complications was the omission of crural repair; of seven patients without crural repair, five developed paraoesophageal hernia/recurrence. Four patients required repeat fundoplication for severe recurrent symptoms and one of these developed the unusual complication of pericardiogastric fistula. Thirteen patients had strictures before operation from reflux oesophagitis, six (46 per cent) resolved after fundoplication alone, six responded to dilatation (mean five sessions), and one required colon interposition. Our preliminary experience with balloon dilatation was encouraging: three of three patients responded after one dilatation only. These results confirmed the efficacy of surgery in controlling reflux: 100 per cent in the short-term and 89 per cent on a 1-6 year follow-up. Major complications might well be reduced by routine crural repair. 
Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on intracellular magnesium. The effects of oral Magnesium (Mg) pyrrolidone carboxylic acid were evaluated in 20 patients affected by menstrual migraine, in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. After a two cycles run-in period, the treatment (360 mg/day of Mg or placebo) started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued till the next menses, for two months. Oral Mg was then supplemented in an open design for the next two months. At the 2nd month, the Pain Total Index was decreased by both Placebo and Mg, with patients receiving active drug showing the lowest values (P less than 0.03). The number of days with headache was reduced only in the patients on active drug. Mg treatment also improved premenstrual complaints, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) scores. The reduction of PTI and MDQ scores was observed also at the 4th month of treatment, when Mg was supplemented in all the patients. Intracellular Mg++ levels in patients with menstrual migraine were reduced compared to controls. During oral Mg treatment, the Mg++ content of Lymphocytes (LC) and Polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) significantly increased, while no changes in plasma or Red Blood Cells were found. An inverse correlation between PTI and Mg++ content in PMN was demonstrated. These data point to magnesium supplementation as a further means for menstrual migraine prophylaxis, and support the possibility that a lower migraine threshold could be related to magnesium deficiency. 
Malignant transformation of an osteoblastoma of the skull: an exceptional occurrence. Case report. What is apparently the first reported case of spontaneous malignant transformation of a benign osteoblastoma of the skull is described. The initial lesion was completely removed surgically and showed the histological features typical of a benign osteoblastoma. No radiotherapy was performed. Eleven years later the patient developed an osteosarcoma of the skull. Review of the literature showed that malignant transformation of benign osteoblastomas is extremely rare and could take place spontaneously. However, the risk of this occurring seems higher after inadequate initial treatment (curettage or partial excision). Follow-up monitoring of patients with osteoblastoma of the cranial vault is suggested. 
Effects of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure on atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin release during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 1. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have increased diuresis during sleep, which decreases with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment. These changes have been attributed to an increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide in obstructive sleep apnoea, and its decrease with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 2. In order to clarify the change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals from nine patients with obstructive sleep apnoea during two nights when the patients were either untreated or treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnographic monitoring, including transcutaneous oximetry, and measurement of oesophageal pressure were performed simultaneously. Plasma arginine vasopressin was also measured. 3. The plasma level of arginine vasopressin did not change. The level of atrial natriuretic peptide was high and exhibited secretion bursts in six out of the nine patients; it drastically decreased with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 4. Across the patients, the mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was correlated with the degree of hypoxaemia and the degree of oesophageal pressure swings during the sleep apnoeas. 5. Within the patients, cross-correlation studies suggested that the atrial natriuretic peptide secretory bursts were related either to the oesophageal pressure swings or to the apnoea-related hypoxaemia. 6. We conclude that release of atrial natriuretic peptide decreases with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in those patients with obstructive sleep apnoea who have increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide before treatment. 
Combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine in murine cryptococcal meningitis. To assess the possible beneficial effects of combined therapy (fluconazole and flucytosine) in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the immunocompromised host, we compared therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine, individually and combined, in the experimental murine model. BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) mice were infected intracerebrally with 150 to 300 CFU of Cryptococcus neoformans. In mortality studies, treatment was initiated 24 h postinfection and continued for 10 to 14 days with either fluconazole (1 to 15 mg/kg of body weight per day), flucytosine (60 to 120 mg/kg/8 h), both drugs, or 0.3% Noble agar (control). Combined therapy delayed mortality significantly when compared with controls and single-drug regimens. This was observed over a broad range of doses. Quantitative determinations of CFU in brain tissue demonstrated a significantly lower burden of C. neoformans in mice receiving combined therapy. The results indicate that combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine is superior to single-drug therapy. 
Effect of aldose reductase inhibition on resistance to ischemic conduction block in diabetic subjects. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat on resistance to ischemic conduction block (RICB) in diabetic subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one healthy diabetic subjects without neuropathy were studied. Subjects were randomized to take either a double-blind trial of 600 mg ponalrestat or placebo once daily for 6 wk. The median nerve action potential (MNAP) and conduction velocity (NCV), before and after 20 min of forearm ischemia, were measured at the start and finish of the study. Results: RICB (MNAP remaining after ischemia) decreased from 39.5 to 29.4% in the ponalrestat-treated group (P less than 0.05) and increased from 48.1 +/- 10.2 to 49.5 +/- 6.5% in the placebo-treated group. MNAP and NCV were unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat partly reverses RICB in diabetes, perhaps by improving nerve hypoxia or reducing nerve energy substrates. 
Intracisternal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm. 
Exercise hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism during long-term beta-adrenergic blockade in severe heart failure Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism at rest and during exercise were investigated in 21 patients with heart failure. The patients were evaluated before and after long-term treatment (14 +/- 7 months) with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol. Clinical improvement with increased functional capacity occurred during treatment. Maximal work load increased by 25% (104 to 130 W; p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic data showed an increased cardiac index (3.8 to 4.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.02) during exercise. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased at rest (20 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and during exercise (32 to 28 mm Hg; p = NS). Stroke volume index (30 to 39 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) and stroke work index (28 to 46 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) increased during exercise and long-term metoprolol treatment. The arterial norepinephrine concentration decreased at rest (3.72 to 2.19 nmol/liter; p less than 0.02) but not during exercise (13.2 to 11.1 nmol/liter; p = NS). The arterial-coronary sinus norepinephrine difference suggested a decrease in myocardial spillover during metoprolol treatment (-0.28 to -0.13 nmol/liter; p = NS at rest and -1.13 to -0.27 nmol/liter; p less than 0.05 during exercise). Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during treatment. Four patients produced myocardial lactate before the study, but none produced lactate after beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). There was no obvious improvement in a subgroup of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In summary, there were signs of increased myocardial work load without higher metabolic costs after treatment with metoprolol. 
Chemotherapy compared with bone marrow transplantation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of intensive postremission chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of patients. SETTING: Chemotherapy recipients were treated in 44 hospitals in West Germany in two cooperative group trials; transplants were done in 98 hospitals worldwide. PATIENTS: Patients (484) receiving intensive postremission chemotherapy and 251 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for ALL in first remission. Patients ranged from 15 to 45 years of age and were treated between 1980 and 1987. MAIN RESULTS: Similar prognostic factors predicted treatment failure (non-T-cell phenotype, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, and 8 or more weeks to achieve first remission) of both therapies. After statistical adjustments were made for differences in disease characteristics and time-to-treatment, survival was similar in the chemotherapy and transplant cohorts: Five-year leukemia-free survival probability was 38% (95% CI, 33% to 43%) with chemotherapy and 44% (CI, 37% to 52%) with transplant. No specific prognostic group had a significantly better outcome with one treatment compared with the other (6% for the difference; CI, -3% to 15%). Causes of treatment failure differed: With chemotherapy, 268 (96%) failures were from relapse and 11 (4%) were treatment-related; with transplants, 43 (32%) failures were from relapse and 92 (68%) were treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bone marrow transplants currently offer no special advantage over chemotherapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. 
Relation between malpractice claims and adverse events due to negligence. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study III. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. By matching the medical records of a random sample of 31,429 patients hospitalized in New York State in 1984 with statewide data on medical-malpractice claims, we identified patients who had filed claims against physicians and hospitals. These results were then compared with our findings, based on a review of the same medical records, regarding the incidence of injuries to patients caused by medical management (adverse events). RESULTS. We identified 47 malpractice claims among 30,195 patients' records located on our initial visits to the hospitals, and 4 claims among 580 additional records located during follow-up visits. The overall rate of claims per discharge (weighted) was 0.13 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.076 to 0.18 percent). Of the 280 patients who had adverse events caused by medical negligence as defined by the study protocol, 8 filed malpractice claims (weighted rate, 1.53 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 3.2 percent). By contrast, our estimate of the statewide ratio of adverse events caused by negligence (27,179) to malpractice claims (3570) is 7.6 to 1. This relative frequency overstates the chances that a negligent adverse event will produce a claim, however, because most of the events for which claims were made in the sample did not meet our definition of adverse events due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. Medical-malpractice litigation infrequently compensates patients injured by medical negligence and rarely identifies, and holds providers accountable for, substandard care. 
Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy in posttraumatic lower limb edema: computed tomography and clinical measurements. The purpose of our study was to assess the amount of posttraumatic lower limb edema and its distribution between subcutaneous and subfascial compartments before and after intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy in patients with fractures of the lower leg immobilized with a cast for six to 12 weeks. Computed tomography (CT) was used as an objective method of measuring the compartmental distribution of edema. Sixteen patients with a mean age of 37 years (range 19 to 64 years) were investigated by clinical measurement of the leg circumference and by CT at the ankle joint and at three equidistant (10cm) levels above it. The unaffected leg served as a control for the evaluation of the amount of edema and density of the tissues. Edema was found primarily in subcutaneous tissue. The IPC treatment decreased relative edema from 23% to 15.9% (p less than 0.01) as measured by CT, and from 23.5% to 13.2% as measured clinically. The density of muscle tissue increased 9% (p less than 0.01) and that of subcutaneous tissue decreased 5.6% (p less than 0.05). The IPC treatment influenced both the amount of edema and the density of tissue compartments. 
High-dose chemotherapy with reinfusion of purged autologous bone marrow following dose-intense induction as initial therapy for metastatic breast cancer. We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy consolidation with reinfusion of purged autologous bone marrow in women with metastatic breast cancer responding to a dose-intense outpatient regimen. Thirty women with hormone-unresponsive metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with adjuvant doxorubicin or with any chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, vincristine, and leucovorin for 16 weeks. Twenty-four patients responded to therapy; 8 showed a complete response, and 16 showed a partial response. These patients proceeded to the next phase of the protocol, ie, marrow harvest and treatment with 6000 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 800 mg/m2 thiotepa given over 4 days. Harvested marrow was purged with 100 micrograms/mL 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and all patients engrafted satisfactorily. The predominant side effects were myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal, and there were no deaths from toxic effects. Three of the 16 patients who showed a partial response after the outpatient phase of treatment achieved a complete response after high-dose therapy. The partial response seen in two more patients converted to a complete response at all sites except bone. The median time to disease progression for all patients in this study was 13 months, and the median survival was 22 months. Four of the original 30 patients remained without disease progression a median of 27 months from entry into the study. This study indicates that this dose-intense regimen can be safely administered, even with the use of purged marrow, with an acceptable toxicity profile. This approach results in a high response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer and could form the basis for a regimen to be tested in the high-risk adjuvant setting. 
Warm heart surgery and results of operation for recent myocardial infarction. Revascularization procedures after recent myocardial infarction are associated with higher mortality and morbidity compared with elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Traditional methods of myocardial protection impose a further ischemic insult on already compromised myocardium. Continuous cold blood cardioplegia may eliminate ischemia but may still leave the heart anaerobic. Theoretically, warm aerobic arrest addresses both of these issues and may become an attractive alternative to standard hypothermic ischemic arrest in this setting. In 115 nonrandomized patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 hours to 7 days of an acute myocardial infarction, myocardial protection was provided with continuous cold (4 degrees C) or continuous warm (37 degrees C) blood cardioplegia. Fifty-one patients (after 1988) protected with warm blood cardioplegia were compared with a historical cohort of 64 patients (before 1988) protected with cold blood cardioplegia. Results indicate that the warm cardioplegia group had no mortality versus 10.9% for the cold group (p less than 0.05), a myocardial infarction rate of 2.0% in the warm versus 9.3% in the cold group, and use of intraaortic balloon pump of 0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that continuous warm aerobic arrest may minimize ischemia and anaerobic metabolism during the operative procedure, and may be of benefit to patients who have a limited tolerance to ischemic insult. 
Dysrhythmias and blood pressure changes associated with thrombolysis. Recent technologic advances facilitate salvage of viable myocardium before the process of myocardial infarction is complete. The aim of thrombolytic agents is to restore antegrade flow of blood in occluded coronary arteries. The process of reperfusion may be dysrhythmogenic because of the heterogeneous return of electrical activity in myocardial cells. This study examined the incidence and type of dysrhythmia occurrence and the associated changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A retrospective chart review of 41 subjects showed that 80% of subjects experienced dysrhythmias during TPA therapy. The most common dysrhythmia was sinus bradycardia, followed by idioventricular/accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. There was a significant difference between MAP changes when there were no dysrhythmias and MAP changes when dysrhythmias occurred (p less than 0.05). The largest change in MAP (-22.71 mm Hg) was observed when dysrhythmias occurred in those subjects with blockage of the left anterior descending artery, although there was no statistically significant difference in changes in MAP among the groups of different sites of blockage (p greater than 0.05). 
Effect of the degree of effort on exercise echocardiography for the detection of restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty. To determine whether the accuracy of exercise echocardiography is affected by the degree of effort during exercise, we examined 101 patients who had 6 months earlier undergone successful coronary artery angioplasty, with resting and immediate postexercise echocardiography and same-day coronary angiography. A positive exercise echocardiographic response was defined as the development of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality postexercise, compared with resting wall motion. Significant coronary disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 48 patients, 38 of whom had single-vessel disease and 10 of whom had two-vessel disease. Exercise echocardiography correctly identified 32 patients with significant disease (sensitivity 67%) and 44 patients without significant disease (specificity 83%). The effect of the degree of exercise effort on the sensitivity and specificity of the test was evaluated by three criteria; (1) the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (MHR), (2) the duration of exercise (DUR), and (3) the double product (DP). To determine the influence of the degree of effort upon sensitivity and specificity, the effort criteria were compared between patients with true positive (TP) tests to those with false negative tests (FN), and in patients with true negative (TN) tests compared with those with false positive (FP) tests. No significant differences were detected in MHR, DUR, or DP between TP versus FN patients or between TN versus FP patients. These results indicate that for symptom-limited exercise echocardiography in postangioplasty patients, neither sensitivity nor specificity is significantly affected by the degree of effort during exercise. 
Normal pressure hydrocephalus in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a patient who had concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a normal pressure hydrocephalus. She improved only after appropriate therapy for each. Although 6 patients with arthritis and normal pressure hydrocephalus have been described, this is the first report of it occurring in a patient with SLE. It has been emphasized that normal pressure hydrocephalus can easily be overlooked in elderly patients with arthritic conditions. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are likelier to occur in patients with SLE than in other rheumatologic conditions, the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus may be delayed or overlooked. Because normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible cause of neurologic dysfunction, it should be considered in appropriate populations. 
"Early" initiation of levodopa treatment does not promote the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, or dementia in Parkinson's disease. We reviewed the histories of patients seen in a large Parkinson's disease clinic from 1983 to 1989 to determine if there is a relationship between the timing of initiation of levodopa therapy and the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, and dementia. There were no factors predisposing to the development of response fluctuations or dementia. Younger age at disease onset predisposed to the development of dyskinesia. Dyskinesias occurred in a greater proportion of patients in whom the initiation of levodopa therapy was delayed by more than 2 years from disease diagnosis than among those in whom treatment was started earlier. We thus failed to identify any adverse consequences of early levodopa treatment in our patient population. 
A multicenter comparison of the safety and efficacy of isradipine and enalapril in the treatment of hypertension. This multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of isradipine and enalapril in 160 patients with essential hypertension. Patients received isradipine or enalapril for 10 weeks after a placebo wash-out period of three to five weeks. Dosage was titrated for six weeks on the basis of blood pressure (BP) response and was then maintained for the remainder of the study. Isradipine reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 12 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, and enalapril by 10 and 7 mm Hg, respectively (between-treatment difference P less than .05 for diastolic BP). Overall, isradipine resulted in a higher responder rate, particularly among patients who had higher entry BPs. Fifteen enalapril-treated patients and four isradipine-treated patients discontinued treatment (four taking enalapril and none taking isradipine withdrew because of lack of efficacy). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, and edema in the isradipine group, and cough, headache, and chest pain in the enalapril group. Both drugs produced significant reductions in BP, but, in this study isradipine was more effective. The drugs were similarly well tolerated. 
Linkage of a cardiac arrhythmia, the long QT syndrome, and the Harvey ras-1 gene Genetic factors contribute to heart disease. In this study, linkage analyses have been performed in a family that is predisposed to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, the long QT syndrome (LQT). A DNA marker at the Harvey ras-1 locus (H-ras-1) was linked to LQT with a logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage (lod score) of 16.44 at theta = 0, which confirms the genetic basis of this trait and localizes this gene to the short arm of chromosome 11. As no recombination was observed between LQT and H-ras-1, and there is a physiological rationale for its involvement in this disease, ras becomes a candidate for the disease locus. 
Evidence for hypoxic depression of CO2-ventilation response in carotid body-resected humans. Steady-state CO2-ventilation response curves with hyperoxia (end-tidal PO2 greater than 200 Torr) and mild hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 approximately equal to 60 Torr) were compared in five carotid body-resected (BR) patients and five control patients. The data were analyzed by fitting a linear equation, V = S(PETCO2-B), where V is minute ventilation S is the response curve slope. PETCO2 is end-tidal PCO2, and B is the response curve threshold. S slightly increased from hyperoxia to hypoxia in both BR and control groups. On the other hand, B moderately increased with hypoxia in BR patients, whereas it slightly decreased in controls. These changes were all not significant. However, in accordance with the change in B, the response curve to hypoxia at V of 10 1/min was significantly shifted in opposite directions in the two groups, i.e., rightward and leftward shift in BR and control groups, respectively. Thus the average magnitude of V calculated at PETCO2 of 40 Torr in hypoxia was significantly lower in BR patients than in controls (P less than 0.01). We conclude that this hypoxic depression of the CO2-ventilation response found in BR patients may have resulted, at least in part, from modulation of the brain stem neural mechanisms that were elicited by loss of afferent discharges from the carotid body. 
Spinal cord stimulation in 60 cases of intractable pain. Sixty patients with spinal cord stimulators implanted for intractable pain lasting up to 50 years were followed for up to nine years. Forty seven per cent derived significant benefit, 23% modest benefit, 20% experienced no effect and 6.7% were made worse. Two were made worse after initial benefit. Complications, indications and factors relevant to the mode of action are discussed. 
cis-platinum ototoxicity in children. Cis-platinum is an ototoxic antineoplastic drug. Evaluation of auditory thresholds in 33 children receiving cis-platinum shows that a threshold shift at 6 and 8 kHz is first measurable after a cumulative dose of 201 to 300 mg/m2. A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2. Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity. A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss. Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2). 
Surveillance for recurrent stenosis after endovascular procedures. A prospective study. Eighty-nine endovascular procedures were performed during a 1-year period. Techniques included balloon angioplasty (n = 50), laser-assisted balloon angioplasty (n = 32), and atherectomy (n = 7). Indications were claudication (65.2%), critical ischemia (30.3%), and failing bypass (4.5%). Preoperative evaluation included a history and physical examination, segmental limb pressures, and color duplex ultrasonography. Postoperative surveillance consisted of a history and physical examination, ankle-arm indexes, and color duplex examinations at 1-week, 1-month, and then 3-month intervals. All levels of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease were treated. Immediate technical success rate was 89.8%. Recurrence rates by life-table analysis reveal a 9-month patency rate of 45.4%. Early results of this prospective study indicate that endovascular procedures are subject to significant restenosis rates. Restraint is advised concerning general acceptance of endovascular procedures pending critical study. 
Influence of physical exercise on serum digoxin concentration and heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart rate and serum digoxin concentration in eight patients with atrial fibrillation were studied at rest and during exercise when initial serum digoxin concentrations were zero and at low and high therapeutic values. Eight patients with ischemic heart disease and in sinus rhythm were studied for comparison. Though the serum digoxin concentration decreased significantly during exercise, the absolute reduction in heart rate was the same at rest and during exercise in patients with atrial fibrillation. Compared with the control patients in sinus rhythm, the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation was not adequately controlled during exercise by any serum digoxin concentration tested despite a reduction in heart rate with increasing digoxin concentration. The effects of digoxin on heart rate regulation in atrial fibrillation are complex and include direct effects on the myocardium as well as indirect effects mediated by modulation of the autonomic nervous system; the present results indicate that the drug is not displaced from the target organs by decreasing serum concentrations during exercise. In atrial fibrillation, because the demands on the filter function of the atrioventricular node are highly unphysiological, the effect of digoxin on heart rate during exercise is not adequate. 
The role of immunoglobulin in bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow transplantation has proven its value as a therapeutic approach to a variety of human diseases, primarily the hematopoietic malignancies. The major clinical problems preventing successful outcome of marrow transplant have been defined and therapeutic approaches to preventing or treating these complications have led to increased long-term disease survival. Passively administered antibody given as intravenous immunoglobulin has been studied as a therapeutic modality following bone marrow transplantation. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of immunoglobulin in reducing bacterial infections in the posttransplant period; reducing severe CMV infections in allogeneic marrow transplant recipients who are seronegative for the virus and susceptible to primary infection; reducing mortality from CMV pneumonia in combination with ganciclovir; and reducing acute graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic BMT. In many cases alternate therapeutic strategies offer comparable or greater efficacy (eg, selective CMV-negative blood products for CMV seronegative allogeneic BMT recipients receiving bone marrow from a seronegative donor). However, it is clear that intravenous immunoglobulin has a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of bone marrow transplantation. Future controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish its exact role and to define which preparations and dose schedules provide the greatest therapeutic benefits. 
Spontaneous release of interferon gamma by intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes in Crohn's disease. Kinetics of in vitro response to interferon gamma inducers. The spontaneous induced release of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) by cultured intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, intestinal lymphocytes from these patients spontaneously released IFN gamma and seemed to contain IFN gamma in their cytoplasm. Autologous peripheral lymphocytes did not release IFN gamma. When stimulated with interferon inducers lamina propria lymphocytes from Crohn's disease tissue showed an increase in IFN gamma release 24 hours after induction with no appreciable further increase over the next two days of culture, while in control cells, either peripheral or intestinal, IFN gamma release progressively increased, peaking 72 hours after induction. These findings indicate that in Crohn's disease the intestinal lymphocytes are stimulated in vivo to produce IFN gamma and that the spontaneous IFN gamma production is compartmentalised to the gut lymphocytes. These data support the concept that locally released IFN gamma has a crucial role in cell interactions in the lamina propria and contribute to the locally occurring immune phenomena in Crohn's disease, including the increased epithelial expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. 
EEG and topographic frequency analysis in common and classic migraine. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes occurring in patients with migraine have received much attention. However, almost equal number of reports indicate the predominance of normal and abnormal findings. We studied the EEG in symptom-free, otherwise healthy, unmedicated 18-28 year-old patients: 22 with common migraine, 20 with classic migraine, and 20 age-matched controls. The routine EEG findings in the three groups revealed mild non-specific slowing in 2 (9%), 3 (15%) and 2 (10%), respectively. Simultaneously, topographic EEG mapping and frequency analysis were performed in 13 consecutive patients with common migraine, 10 patients with classic migraine and 11 age-matched controls. EEG mapping showed minimal regional differences with lower power in the alpha range in patients with eyes closed. The peak alpha power, as well as its reactivity, were lower among patients than controls. This difference reached statistical significance only for patients with classic migraine versus controls in the left occipital region. Patients also had slightly faster peak alpha frequency. No frank right-left asymmetry was observed in the peak alpha power, neither among the controls, nor the patients. All the findings were rather minor. They may suggest some difference in the posterior background activity in the EEG in migraine patients as compared to the controls, but are not useful in differentiating migraine from non-migraine patients. 
Severe limb abnormalities after chorion villus sampling at 56-66 days' gestation Among 289 pregnancies in which chorion villus sampling (CVS) was carried out at 56-66 days' gestation, 5 babies with severe limb abnormalities were subsequently identified. 4 had oromandibular-limb hypogenesis syndromes, and the other had a terminal transverse limb reduction defect. This high incidence raises the possibility that CVS was an aetiological factor for these developmental anomalies. 
Gold-associated lymphadenopathy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Histologic and scanning electron microscopic features. The histologic features of adenopathy associated with intramuscular injections of gold sodium thiomalate in a woman with rheumatoid arthritis are presented. We believe that the light microscopic features of the above process are sufficiently distinctive that a diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy could be rendered. A review of the literature revealed no descriptions of the light microscopic appearance of gold in lymph nodes. In this case, the diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic studies. 
Factors influencing admission blood pressure levels in patients with acute stroke. In clinical practice, patients with acute stroke often have high blood pressure. The aim of this study was to investigate factors correlated with blood pressure elevation in 843 consecutive stroke patients on hospital admission to a nonintensive stroke unit. Using a multivariate analysis model, we analyzed the influence on admission blood pressure of sex, age, previous hypertension, cardiac failure, diabetes, type of stroke, impaired consciousness, and latency between onset of symptoms and admission. Previous hypertension was the strongest predictor (p less than 0.001) of elevated blood pressure on admission, followed by the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.001). The latency between onset of symptoms and admission showed no correlation with blood pressure levels at hospitalization. Previously, high blood pressure levels on hospital admission have been shown to decline within a few days in hospital. We therefore hypothesize that mental stress on hospital admission may be a major factor in the blood pressure elevation seen in acute stroke. 
Congestive heart failure secondary to an arteriovenous fistula from cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are well known to cause high output cardiac failure. AV fistulae from cardiac catheterization are as rare as 0.01% in the transfemoral approach. We describe here what we believe is the first reported case of high output cardiac failure from an AV fistula due to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patient had reversal of the congestive heart failure with surgical correction of the fistula. 
Reliability of peak physiological responses during wheelchair ergometry in persons with spinal cord injury. This study examined the test-retest reliability of peak physiological responses during wheelchair ergometry (WE) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Seven wheelchair dependent subjects, two with paraplegia (T10-11 and T11-12 lesions) and five with quadriplegia (all with C6-7 lesions), were given two incremental exercise tests to volitional fatigue on separate occasions within a one-week period. Each subject wheeled his or her personal wheelchair, which was mounted on a set of frictionless rollers with side-mounted flywheels. Metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses were continuously monitored by means of an automated metabolic measurement cart interfaced with an electrocardiograph. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences (p greater than .05) between the mean values of the two test trials for six peak values. Reliability coefficients (p less than .01) were: oxygen uptake (0.98), heart rate (0.97), ventilation volume (0.96), respiratory exchange ratio (0.91), oxygen pulse (0.96), and ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (0.88). The investigators concluded that these six physiological responses in subjects with SCI undergoing WE are highly reliable, and that these variables can be used in the objective prescription, monitoring, and evaluation of exercise rehabilitation programs for individuals with SCI. 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with plasma exchange or exchange transfusions. Of 40 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 17 were treated with plasma exchange, 15 with exchange transfusions, and 6 with both types of therapy. One patient died before being treated and another patient was seen but not treated. Plasma exchange was performed daily for a mean of seven exchanges per patient. The replacement fluid during plasma exchange was fresh frozen plasma in all cases. The complete response rates for each type of treatment were as follows: 88% for plasma exchange (15 patients), 47% for exchange transfusions (7 patients), and 67% for exchange transfusions and plasma exchange (4 patients). Clinical and laboratory factors were examined for any statistically significant association with therapy response. Treatment with plasma exchange was statistically the initial factor most strongly associated with prognosis. Paresis, paresthesias, seizures, mental status change, and coma showed no association with response to treatment. Some of the laboratory factors that did not show significant association with treatment response were the initial creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin. This study supports the hypothesis that plasma exchange has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These patients should be treated aggressively regardless of the severity of their symptoms. 
Infrared, thermistor, and glass-mercury thermometry for measurement of body temperature in children with cancer. Body temperature is often the sole determinant of whether or not the neutropenic cancer patient is admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic therapy. Recently developed infrared tympanic thermometers offer rapid readings, but their accuracy has not been established. We studied two infrared thermometers (FirstTemp and Thermoscan) and a thermistor (IVAC) in children with cancer. Mean infrared measurements did not differ significantly between right and left ear canals, and the mean IVAC temperature did not differ significantly from the left to the right axilla (P greater than 0.05, paired t test). IVAC predictive mode mean temperature was 0.2 degrees C lower than monitor mode mean temperature in the axilla (P less than 0.0001), but 0.1 degree C higher than monitor mode orally (P less than 0.0001). Aiming the infrared instrument at the tympanic membrane using an ear tug resulted in a 0.2 degree C higher mean temperature than casual placement in the ear canal (P less than 0.0001). After compensation for the mean difference in reference oral glass-mercury versus test instrument temperatures, the FirstTemp, Thermoscan, and oral and axillary predictive mode IVAC measurements yielded sensitivities for the detection of fever of 84%, 84%, 82%, and 86%; specificities of 100%, 99%, 100%, and 100%; positive predictive values of 100%, 93%, 100%, and 100%; and negative predictive values of 95%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. We conclude that each of these instruments detects fever with comparable reliability. Infrared instruments are especially attractive alternatives due to their time efficiency. 
Results of the pelvic-pouch procedure in patients with Crohn's disease. The pelvic-pouch procedure has become a standard operation for selected patients with ulcerative colitis, but is contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease at our institution. However, the distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis can sometimes be difficult, if not impossible. Between January 1982, and March 1989, 272 patients with ulcerative colitis underwent pelvic-pouch procedures at our institution. Nine (3.5 percent) of these patients eventually were found to have Crohn's disease. The records of these patients were examined to assess their clinical outcome and complication rate. There were five females and four males with a mean age of 28.8 years. In five patients (Group I) the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made postoperatively on histologic examination of the rectum. The ileostomy was closed in all patients. Two developed complications necessitating excision of the pouch. Three patients are well. In the other four cases (Group II) the mean time to diagnosis was 2.5 years after the pouch procedure. Three patients developed pouch-vaginal fistula, and one multiple anal fissures and stenosis. Two required excision of the pouch whereas two have a functioning pouch but with a persistent pouch-vaginal fistula (n = 1) or anal fissures (n = 1). Overall, four patients have had their pouches removed, and five patients have functioning pouches: three with no complications and two with persistent perianal disease. Thus, we would conclude that the pelvic-pouch procedure should not knowingly be performed in patients with Crohn's disease because of the high associated complication rate. 
c-erbB-2 expression in different histological types of invasive breast carcinoma. Sections of 149 breast carcinomas were examined for the over-expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique and two different specific antibodies. These included the polyclonal antibody 21N and the monoclonal antibody 4D5. The tumours were divided into two main groups. The first included 75 cases of invasive ductal and classic invasive lobular carcinomas. The second group consisted of 74 cases with histological types known to have a good prognosis, including mucinous, alveolar variant of invasive lobular, medullary, tubular, cribriform and papillary carcinomas. Fifteen (20%) tumours of the first group were positive with the two antibodies. Fourteen of these were of the ductal type and one was a mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma. Ten of the pure ductal cases had areas of comedo carcinoma. The intraductal elements in a further tumour were positively stained with 21N antibody only. None of the second group of tumours, which included histological types known to have good prognosis, stained with 4D5, although one mucinous carcinoma was positively stained with 21N. These findings suggest that in invasive breast carcinoma immunostaining for c-erbB-2 is mainly seen in a subgroup of ductal tumours, and that almost all other histological types, especially those associated with good prognosis, lack this expression. 
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction with exercise and Doppler echocardiography. Exercise testing early after myocardial infarction has been shown to be of further risk stratification value among otherwise low-risk patients on the basis of an uncomplicated clinical course. The addition of cardiac imaging modalities to exercise testing has augmented this capacity. Exercise echocardiographic imaging before and immediately after treadmill exercise can be accomplished in 85-95% of patients. New or worsening wall motion abnormalities identify 63-80% of patients who will suffer cardiac events and correctly predict 78-95% of those who will not. In addition, exercise echocardiography can detect multivessel coronary artery disease with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. These results are superior to those obtained by analyzing global left ventricular function during exercise, exercise aortic Doppler velocity profiles, or exercise electrocardiography. How exercise echocardiography compares with 201Tl perfusion imaging after myocardial infarction awaits a systematic study. Therefore, the choice between exercise echocardiography and perfusion imaging depends on physician preference, availability, cost, and service. 
Incidence of neuropathy in 395 patients with ovarian cancer treated with or without cisplatin. In two consecutive trials, a total of 395 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic regimens including cisplatin or without this drug. With respect to neurotoxicity, 387 patients were fully eligible. The median follow-up for survival was 45 months. Neurotoxicity in any grade of severity developed in 47% of the patients treated with a cisplatin-containing regimen and in 25% of those treated with the non-cisplatin-containing regimen. The severity of neurotoxicity was much higher, however, in the cisplatin-treated patients. Neurotoxicity-free survival decreased below 50% at cumulative doses of cisplatin between 500 and 600 mg/m2. No additional effect of hexamethylmelamine on the incidence or severity of neurotoxicity could be demonstrated. In patients who survived for more than 5 years, the incidence of cisplatin neuropathy was 61%. Prognostic variables (age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, performance status, and others) possibly associated with high-risk subgroups could not be identified. The only consistent factor correlated with neurotoxicity was the total dose of cisplatin received. 
Cocaine, fetal loss, and the role of the forensic pathologist. Adverse obstetrical outcomes are often associated with maternal cocaine use. These have included intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion and pre-term labor. This report details the case of an 18-week-gestation fetus recovered from a sewage treatment plant. A brain specimen was positive for cocaine. With the present epidemic of cocaine abuse, it is important for the forensic pathologist to seek toxicologic evidence of cocaine in all suspicious fetal and neonatal deaths. 
Bile duct diverticula and webs: nonspecific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Biliary tree diverticula and webs are considered by several authors to be specific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Our experience suggested that these findings can be seen in patients without PSC. The purpose of this study was twofold: to establish whether diverticula and webs are indeed specific for PSC and to assess whether PSC can be accurately diagnosed without reference to diverticula or webs. We retrospectively reviewed 861 consecutive ERCP studies and found 32 cases of webs and/or diverticula. Using accepted cholangiographic, clinical, and histologic criteria, we diagnosed PSC in nine patients and excluded it in 21, with two instances of uncertain diagnoses. Webs and diverticula seen in PSC were cholangiographically indistinguishable from those in the group without PSC. All 21 patients without PSC had other biliary abnormalities, and were grouped by the predominant abnormality or finding believed to be associated with diverticulum or web formation: common duct stones or cholangitis (n = 11 patients), postoperative stricture (n = 4), bile duct stent and balloon dilatation (n = 3), malignant stricture (n = 2), and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 1). To assess cholangiographic diagnosis of PSC in these patients, a blinded reviewer studied the radiographs of the 30 patients with diverticula and/or webs who had confirmed diagnoses. By using established radiologic criteria alone (ignoring diverticula and webs), the correct diagnosis was made in 27, yielding a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. We conclude that the presence of diverticula and/or webs on a cholangiogram is a nonspecific finding and may be due to inflammation or trauma to the bile duct wall. Further, PSC can be distinguished from other abnormalities on the basis of findings other than diverticula and webs. 
Crackles in interstitial lung disease. Comparison of sarcoidosis and fibrosing alveolitis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Determine why crackles on chest auscultation are characteristic of most interstitial lung diseases, but may not be heard in sarcoidosis. DESIGN: All patients with sarcoidosis or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis seen during a four-week period were studied. In a second study to relate ausculatory findings to anatomy, patients with fibrotic changes on their chest roentgenogram were studied. SETTING: Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: In the first part, all patients seen over the course of one month were studied. In the second study, patients with pulmonary fibrosis seen on chest roentgenograms were studied. INTERVENTIONS: For the first study, two independent observers performed auscultation on five sites for crackles and reviewed four roentgenogram quadrants for changes. For the second study, patients underwent VC measurements, auscultation, and high resolution computer tomography scans. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: For the first study, crackles were noted at greater than 2 sites in all 11 CFA patients, but only one of 17 SARC patients (p less than 0.001). Roentgenogram changes were seen in greater than 2 quadrants in nine of 11 CFA patients and eight of 17 SARC patients (p = ns). In the second study, the VC was similar in the two groups: SARC: 1.96 +/- .90 L (means +/- SD), 58 +/- 20.4 percent predicted; CFA: 1.81 +/- .33 L, 59 +/- 9.2 percent predicted). Only two of 14 SARC patients had crackles in greater than 1 area, while all 14 CFA patients had crackles at greater than 2 sites. The HRCT studies were read by a radiologist unaware of the diagnosis. The presence and degree (0 to 3 scale) of subpleural and peribronchial fibrosis were scored. Twelve SARC patients had peribronchial changes (mean score 1.9 +/- 1.08), while only eight had subpleural fibrosis (mean score .6 +/- .52). There was a significantly different pattern in the CFA patients, where eight had peribronchial fibrosis (mean score = .9 +/- .78, p less than 0.05) and all 14 had subpleural fibrosis (mean score = 1.6 +/- .73, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that crackles are more frequent in fibrosing alveolitis than in sarcoidosis; this difference may be due to the distribution of parenchymal fibrosis. 
The novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist CGP 37849 preferentially induces phencyclidine-like behavioral effects in kindled rats: attenuation by manipulation of dopamine, alpha-1 and serotonin1A receptors. The novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 37849) was found to produce a phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral syndrome (ataxia, locomotion, stereotypies) in amygdala-kindled rats, whereas the amphetamine-like behavioral alterations of the syndrome (locomotion, stereotypies) were only infrequently seen in nonkindled rats. In dose-response experiments in kindled and nonkindled rats, behavioral effects were scored using a ranked intensity scale, and the behaviors and behavioural scores determined after CGP 37849 were compared with those determined after i.p. administration of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). In kindled rats, 20 mg/kg of CGP 37849 produced about the same scores for hyperlocomotion and head weaving as 0.1 mg/kg of MK-801. Kindled rats exhibited higher behavioral scores than nonkindled rats, especially in the case of CGP 37849. The behavioral effects produced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats were almost indistinguishable from the PCP-like behavioral effects induced by MK-801, indicating that CGP 37849 indeed produces a PCP-like pattern of behavior in kindled rats. Hyperlocomotion and head weaving induced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats could be attenuated or totally prevented by pretreatment with ipsapirone, a partial agonist/antagonist at postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype. Furthermore, these behavioural effects were attenuated or blocked by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol and the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The data demonstrate that kindling induces a hypersensitivity to PCP-like behavioral effects of competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, which could relate to the recent finding of increased function of NMDA receptors following kindling. 
Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of bundle branch block. Autopsy and echocardiographic studies indicate that ECG criteria for LVH tend to maintain their sensitivity in the presence of LBBB, with the exception of left precordial lead criteria alone. With RBBB, ECG criteria for LVH using right precordial S waves and combination criteria of right precordial S waves and left precordial R waves have a marked reduction in sensitivity, whereas left precordial R wave criteria have modestly reduced sensitivity. Limb lead criteria for LVH have increased sensitivity in the presence of RBBB and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of LBBB. Acceptable sensitivity for the diagnosis of LVH in patients with bundle branch block requires a combination of limb and precordial lead voltage criteria and/or other nonvoltage ECG criteria, since the prevalence of LVH in the presence of RBBB or LBBB appears higher than the sensitivity of individual criteria. 
Peritoneal leukocyte response following placement of polyglycolic acid intestinal sling in patients with rectal carcinoma. The intestinal sling procedure has been used successfully without the observance of pelvic infections. This procedure involves the implantation of polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh to hold the bowel out of the pelvis to prevent radiation enteritis. We previously showed that PGA mesh has no intrinsic bactericidal activity. Since phagocytic leukocytes produce reactive oxygen intermediates during respiratory burst that are associated with oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity, we examined peritoneal cell types and their respiratory burst activity isolated from patients with biopsy-confirmed rectal carcinoma who underwent the intestinal sling procedure (N = 12) compared with patients who did not (N = 13). There was no significant difference in the cell types within the peritoneal cavity over the 7-day postoperative period examined. However, there was a significant increase in the ability of leukocytes isolated from mesh patients to produce hydrogen peroxide in the absence of an exogenous stimulus (P less than 0.05), as measured by flow cytometric quantitation of oxidation of the hydroperoxide-sensitive dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Despite the higher endogenous DCFH oxidation by leukocytes from mesh patients, the cells retained the ability to oxidize DCFH following treatment with a membrane-active stimulant for respiratory burst activity, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. These observations suggest that PGA mesh used for the intestinal sling procedure stimulates the respiratory burst activity of peritoneal leukocytes during the postoperative period in which bacterial proliferation and colonization occur. The stimulation of reactive oxygen intermediates involved in oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity by PGA mesh may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lack of infections observed with the use of PGA mesh in contaminated settings. 
Topographic variations in the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve. Autopsy study with clinical correlations. The description of the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve (GON) varies in the literature. An autopsy study was done on 20 cases without known headache problems. These findings showed a marked variation in the relation between the GON and nuchal muscles. The trapezius muscle was penetrated by the GON in 45% of cases, the semispinal muscle of the head was penetrated in 90% of cases, and the inferior oblique muscle of head was penetrated in 7.5% of cases. Macroscopic findings of possible compression were made in 11 cases (27.5%), indicating that nerve compression per se may be of minor importance since it seems to exist in the absence of headache. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. I. Medical and pathophysiological aspects. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, stiffness, non-restorative sleep and psychological disturbance. At present, much about the etiology, pathological mechanisms and course of FS are unknown. Indeed, standardized diagnostic criteria have only been recently agreed upon. The present paper is the first of a two-part series which reviews the extant empirical literature concerning FS, with a view to arriving at an integrated understanding of the syndrome. The present paper describes the clinical presentation of FS and historical conceptualizations of the disorder. Available research on pathophysiological mechanisms in FS is then presented. In this section we have included literature concerning histology of muscle, sleep architecture, neurotransmitter anomalies and neuropeptide involvement in FS symptomatology. 
MRI reveals multiple reversible cerebral lesions in an attack of acute intermittent porphyria. A 20-year-old woman had an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) with seizures and hallucinations. MRI revealed multiple lesions in both hemispheres. Both the cerebral clinical abnormalities and the MRI lesions resolved following treatment. These findings suggest that a vascular mechanism may underlie the pathogenesis of cerebral dysfunction in AIP. 
Acute effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma atrial natriuretic peptides during exercise in elderly patients with mild hypertension. In a randomized study in 26 elderly patients with mild essential hypertension, acute effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma ANP levels were examined at rest and during ergometric exercise. Plasma ANP level and LVEF were measured before and after administration of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), atenolol (a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker), or carteolol (a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker). Plasma ANP level was increased by exercise. Carteolol and atenolol increased plasma ANP levels at rest and during exercise, but the effect of atenolol was not statistically significant. Prazosin significantly suppressed the ANP values at rest and during exercise. The LVEF was increased by prazosin and decreased by beta-blockers, especially by carteolol. Multivariate regression analysis showed that LVEF was the most significant predictor of the plasma ANP level at maximal exercise; the resting blood pressure and heart rate were not predictors of this value. The results showed that single administrations of an alpha-blocker and a nonselective beta-blocker had opposite effects on the plasma ANP level both at rest and during exercise in elderly patients with mild essential hypertension. The observed difference in the ANP response seems to be related to changes in left ventricular function rather than changes in blood pressure or heart rate. 
Carrying as colic "therapy": a randomized controlled trial. In healthy infants, crying behavior is reduced significantly by "supplemental" carrying; that is, increased carrying throughout the day in addition to that which occurs during feeding and in response to crying. To determine whether the recommendation to increase carrying would be effective as a therapy for colic, 66 mothers of infants 4 weeks of age or less who came to their pediatricians with complaints of crying problems ("colic") were randomized to receive standard pediatric advice (standard group) or standard advice plus the recommendation to increase supplemental carrying by 50% (supplemental group). Overall, the supplemental group carried their infants 6.1 hours/d throughout the intervention period, an increase of 2.2 hours/d (56%) more than that provided by the standard group. Despite this significant increase in carrying, there was no difference between groups in the duration or frequency of crying, fussing, or cry/fuss at any time throughout the intervention period. When the greatest treatment effect was expected at 6 weeks, the supplemental group infants cried only 3 minutes less per day (95% confidence interval: 37 minutes less to 32 minutes more per day). We conclude that, compared with standard pediatric advice to be "responsive," supplemental carrying does not reduce crying and fussing behavior further in infants who have colic. In marked contrast to healthy infants, this apparent resistance to increased carrying may indicate an important difference in state regulation and control in infants with colic. 
Angiotensin-induced growth related metabolism is activated in cultured smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) proliferate in culture faster than those isolated from sex- and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) animals. There was no difference in the kinetics of S6 kinase activation in the two cultures, but later metabolic events associated with proliferation were stimulated earlier in SHR cells than in WKY, eg, activation of ornithine decarboxylase. Both cell types elaborated an extensive extra-cellular matrix in culture composed of a different blend of connective tissue macromolecules. Matrix material from SHR cells was more stimulatory to growth of WKY cultures than their own matrices. Angiotensin stimulated the growth and synthesis of extra-cellular matrix material in SHR more than in WKY derived vascular smooth muscle cell cultures. 
Relationship between coronary blood flow and perfusion pressure during reactive hyperemia: a case report in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries. The linear relationship between coronary blood flow and mean arterial pressure during reactive hyperemia is presented for the first time in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries during systemic hypotension induced by pharmacologic vasodilation. This case demonstrates the critical dependence of coronary flow reserve on simultaneous perfusion pressure. 
Age-dependent increase in deleted mitochondrial DNA in the human heart: possible contributory factor to presbycardia. Cardiac function deteriorates with age, and endogenous damage to mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) is believed to be a major contributory factor to aging. Mitochondria occupy a pivotal position in energy metabolism, and mitochondria have their own DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the mitochondrial energy transducing system. Other subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. DNA has been shown to have a high mutation rate, and genetic mutation might primarily be ascribed to mtDNA mutation in the energy transducing system. Recent advances in gene technology, especially in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), permit us to analyze mtDNA mutations in a small quantity of tissue. We devised rapid and accurate methods to detect mitochondrial mutations--the primer shift PCR method, PCR-Southern method, the modified primer shift PCR method, and the asymmetric PCR method. With these methods, we analyzed myocardia mtDNA in human cadavers of various ages (from 3 years old to 97 years old, mean 57 years old). The 7.4 kb deletion of mtDNA was commonly detected in elderly subjects, and the proportion of deleted mtDNA to normal mtDNA increased with age. Deleted mtDNA was observed in all subjects that were over 70 years old. The mutation was based on the directly repeated sequence: 5'-CATCAA-CAACCG-3', which exists in both the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the displacement loop (D-loop) region. Replication impairment occurred at that directly repeated sequence, which caused the elimination of genomes between the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the D-loop region and resulted in a 7.4 kb deletion. 
Indications for modification of coexisting dual atrioventricular node pathways in patients undergoing surgical ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections Concomitant susceptibility to atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia has been demonstrated in certain patients having reentrant tachycardia utilizing accessory AV connections. For those patients undergoing accessory connection ablation, AV node surgical modification may be warranted during the same operative procedure. To assess indications for a combined operative procedure, this study evaluated potential predictors of subsequent spontaneous AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients undergoing ablation of accessory AV connections. Among 62 consecutive patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection, 13 (21%) manifested dual AV node pathways. The latter were identified preoperatively in five patients (four with concealed and one with bidirectional accessory connections) and postoperatively in seven (all seven with bidirectional accessory connections). In one patient with a bidirectional accessory connection, dual AV node pathways could not be demonstrated preoperatively, but AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced. Operative ablation of an accessory connection was successful in all patients. However, postoperatively, 2 of the 13 patients had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, 5 had AV node "echo" beats and 6 had no inducible arrhythmia. During 26 +/- 7 months of follow-up study, the two patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia postoperatively had symptomatic AV node reentrant tachycardia. In addition, the one patient with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia preoperatively had recurrence of this tachycardia 4 months after attempted surgical modification of the AV node. Consequently, although dual AV node pathways appear to be common in patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection (21%), only a small group (3 of 13) of these patients are at risk for subsequent clinical AV node reentrant tachycardia. 
A mutant alpha subunit of Gi2 induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. In a recently discovered class of oncogenes, GTPase-inhibiting mutations constitutively activate alpha subunits of signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Somatic mutations in a subclass of endocrine tumors are found in the arginine-179 codon of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2), creating the putative gip2 oncogene. We have tested the ability of gip2 to mediate neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in tissue culture. Expression of a mutant alpha i2 cDNA encoding cysteine in place of arginine-179 (alpha i2-R179C) caused Rat-1 cells to grow to a higher density in monolayer culture, to lose anchorage dependence, and to form tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, expression of alpha i2-R179C failed to alter growth or tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that gip2 is an oncogene, by the criterion that it induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. Failure of gip2 to transform NIH 3T3 cells is in keeping with clinical indications that gip2 is a tissue-selective oncogene. 
Prognostic factors in multiple myeloma. The pretreatment characteristics of 265 multiple myeloma patients treated between 1977 and 1983 were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival. Patients whose diagnosis was based on bone marrow plasmacytosis (greater than 30%) were noticed to have poorer survival (P less than 0.001). Although classification of patients according to stage has traditionally been used to identify prognostic groups, differences in survival were noted only between Stage III and Stage I or II patients using one of two common staging systems. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model identified the following prognostic factors in order of importance: plasmacytosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 3.27), hypercalcemia (HR = 1.68, CI = 1.22 to 2.32), hypoalbuminemia (HR = 1.51, CI = 1.15 to 1.99), alkaline phosphatase (HR = 1.62, CI = 1.18 to 2.23), hyperuricemia (HR = 1.46, CI = 1.09 to 1.96), and renal insufficiency (HR = 1.48, CI = 1.08 to 2.04). All patients were followed from 2 to 7.5 years and 130 (49%) survived over 2 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hyperuricemia, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, plasmacytosis, gender, alkaline phosphatase, and hypercalcemia were significant predictors of 2-year survival. Knowledge of these factors could be of value in predicting prognosis and planning therapy in patients with multiple myeloma. 
Collagenous colitis: a prospective trial of prednisolone in six patients. In a prospective study, the clinicopathological effect of prednisolone was evaluated in six patients with collagenous colitis. Prednisolone was associated with a significant decrease in stool frequency. However, the effect was transitory, since the diarrhoea recurred when prednisolone treatment was discontinued. There was a trend toward a diminished inflammatory response in the post-treatment biopsies, but the thickness of the collagen band remained unchanged, except in one patient. Until the results of further studies are available, we recommend that treatment with prednisolone be restricted to periods of acute diarrhoeal episodes. 
Early prediction of acute myocardial infarction from clinical history, examination and electrocardiogram in the emergency room. The possibility of early prediction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 7,157 consecutive patients coming to our emergency room during a 21-month period with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of AMI. Of these patients 921 developed an AMI during the first 3 days in the hospital. Of the 4,690 patients admitted to hospital, 1,576 (34%) had a normal admission electrocardiogram, and 90 of these (6%) developed AMI. Of 1,964 patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram without signs of acute ischemia (42% of those admitted), 268 (14%) developed AMI, and 563 (51%) of 1,109 patients with acute ischemia on the electrocardiogram (24%) developed AMI. All patients were prospectively classified in the emergency room on the basis of history, clinical examination and electrocardiogram into 1 of 4 categories, according to the initial degree of suspicion of AMI. Of 279 admitted patients judged to have an obvious AMI (6% of the 4,690), 245 (88%) actually developed AMI; of 1,426 with a strong suspicion of AMI (30%), 478 (34%) developed one; of 2,519 with a vague suspicion of AMI (54%), 192 (8%) developed one; and of 466 with no suspicion of AMI (10%), 6 (1%) developed one. Thus, only a low percentage of the patients with a normal initial electrocardiogram or a vague initial suspicion of AMI developed a confirmed AMI. 
Evaluation of the patient presenting with headache. In order to treat the patient presenting with headache successfully, one must carefully question, examine, and study the complete patient as well as his or her complaint of headache. Through direct and indirect questioning, a complete history may be obtained by exploring present illness, past medical history, family history, personal and social history, and systems review. A detailed medical and neurologic examination is also necessary to evaluate the complaint of headache. A comprehensive screening laboratory profile should be employed, but neurodiagnostic studies should only be used judiciously. A combined medical and neurologic approach will permit appropriate identification and effective treatment of the specific headache disorder rather than the isolated complaint of headache. 
Results of surgery for extratemporal partial epilepsy that began in childhood. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable extratemporal seizures originating in childhood are described. Candidates for surgery were selected on the basis of clinical criteria, neurodiagnostic imaging, and an electroencephalographic investigation that included the use of sphenoidal electrodes and long-term monitoring. Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used. Our results, with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement, are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process. Sixty-three percent of the 35 patients (76.5% of those operated on after the introduction of long-term electroencephalographic monitoring) became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75%. The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy, even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe. 
High breath pentane concentrations during acute myocardial infarction To investigate whether reperfusion after myocardial ischaemia leads to free-radical-mediated peroxidation of membrane lipids and cell damage, we measured pentane, a product of lipid peroxidation, in the breath of 10 healthy control subjects and in 20 consecutive patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. 10 of these patients showed no myocardial damage on electrocardiography (patient control group) and 10 satisfied standard diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. The three groups were well matched for age, sex, underlying disease, and smoking habits. The time from onset of chest pain to breath collection was similar in the patient control and acute myocardial infarction groups. The breath pentane concentration was higher (p less than 0.0001) in the acute myocardial infarction group (4.96 [1.15] nmol/l) than in the patient control (1.96 [1.04] nmol/l) and healthy control groups (1.71 [0.87] nmol/l). Lipid peroxidation during acute myocardial infarction reflects action of oxygen radicals and their potential for contribution to the pathogenesis of tissue damage. 
T cells from tumor-immune mice nonspecifically expanded in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 retain specific function in vitro and can eradicate disseminated leukemia in vivo. The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of cancer has been shown to positively correlate with the dose of tumor-immune T cells transferred. Therefore, the success of this therapy is critically dependent on the ability to procure large numbers of functionally active T cells. Previous studies in animal models have shown that the limited therapeutic efficacy of a small number of immune T cells can be greatly enhanced by expansion of T cells in vitro to greater numbers before transfer in vivo. Optimal regimens for T cell expansion in vitro have generally employed the use of intermittent stimulation of the TCR with specific Ag followed by exogenous IL-2. The use of IL-2 alone does not provide for requisite episodic up-regulation of IL-2R. Stimulation of the invariant CD3 portion of the TCR/CD3 complex with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) represents an alternative method of up-regulating IL-2R and has been used to nonspecifically induce the growth of Ag-specific T cell lines and clones long-term in vitro with maintenance of function and specificity. The current study examined whether resting T cell populations containing small numbers of memory tumor-specific T cells could be rendered more effective in tumor therapy by nonspecific expansion in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. Spleens from C57BL/6 mice previously immunized to FBL-3, a syngeneic virus-induced leukemia, were nonspecifically stimulated with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. The resultant T cells were expanded in number, were nonlytic to FBL-3 but retained the ability to become lytic upon specific stimulation by FBL-3, and were effective in specific tumor therapy. The Ag-specific anti-tumor immune function declined on a per cell basis after each cycle of anti-CD3-induced T cell expansion. However, the approach resulted in a substantial increase in total T cell number and an overall net increase in the function of the effector T cell population. Thus, stimulation of tumor-immune T cell populations with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 represents a nonspecific method for expanding the number of specific effector T cells for cancer therapy. 
Welander's distal myopathy: clinical, neurophysiological and muscle biopsy observations in young and middle aged adults with early symptoms. Nine young or middle aged patients with early symptoms of Welander's distal myopathy were subjected to a detailed neurological examination including quantitative sensory testing, determination of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV), sensory nerve action potentials, electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). Slight weakness of the extensors of the fingers and hands was found in all nine patients, and of the dorsiflexors of the feet in seven. All patients had a distal sensory disturbance most prominent for temperature which agrees with earlier observations. EMG changes in TA and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles were of myopathic type. Slight abnormalities compatible with either myopathy or early neuropathy were found in one muscle biopsy. These findings indicate that a neurogenic lesion affecting at least the peripheral sensory system is present at an early stage of Welander's distal myopathy and that the neurogenic lesion might precede the myopathic changes. 
Exercise electrocardiography versus dipyridamole echocardiography testing in coronary angioplasty. Early functional evaluation and prediction of angina recurrence. Recently, we have shown the usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing (DET) as an exercise-independent method for the evaluation of patients having coronary angioplasty. The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of DET compared with exercise testing in the early functional evaluation after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in the prediction of late recurrence of angina. We performed DET and exercise testing in 52 consecutive patients both before and after successful PTCA. Criteria of positivity for DET were transient dyssynergy absent or negligible in the baseline examination and exercise testing for an ST segment shift greater than 0.1 mV from baseline. All patients had an angiographically successful PTCA: the percent stenosis went from 78 +/- 7% before to 30 +/- 7% after PTCA. Exercise testing was positive in 49 and 29 patients, respectively, before and after PTCA (94% versus 44%, p less than 0.001). DET was positive in 47 patients before and in 10 after PTCA (90% versus 19%, p less than 0.001). Recurrence of angina was found in 18 patients: 14 of 23 with positive and four of 29 with negative exercise testing after PTCA. With DET, recurrence of angina was found in eight of 10 patients with positive and 10 of 42 with negative DET after PTCA. 
Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma with aggressive course. Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma is an uncommon variant of skin-based peripheral T-cell lymphoma typically characterized by cutaneous nodules in elderly patients and a chronic clinical course. We report a case of the disease that led to the patient's death within 2 years after onset. This disease may be associated with a more aggressive clinical course than generally recognized. 
Coronary angioplasty in octogenarians: comparisons to coronary bypass surgery. Coronary angioplasty was performed in 74 patients 80 years of age and older (mean 83 +/- 3). Single vessel coronary disease was present in 34% and multivessel coronary disease in 66%. Angioplasty of a single vessel was performed in 51 patients (69%), while 23 (31%) had angioplasty of multiple vessels. Angioplasty was successful in 59 of 74 patients (80%). Angioplasty was unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 12 (16%) due to (unyielding) calcified lesions or (impassable) old occlusions. Of these 12, 8 were discharged on medical therapy and 4 underwent elective uncomplicated bypass surgery prior to discharge. Three (4%) patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery due to abrupt vessel closure during the angioplasty procedure, with one hospital death (1.4%). Follow-up (mean 24 +/- 22 months) was obtained in all patients. Of the 59 successful angioplasty patients, late mortality was 10% (cardiac 7% and non-cardiac 3%). Survival and survival without myocardial infarction were both 90%; survival without either infarction or bypass surgery was 86%. Actuarial 3-year survival was 91% and 3-year freedom from death, infarction or bypass surgery was 87% by life-table analysis. Repeat angioplasty for restenosis was performed in 7 patients (12%) without complications. 
Prevention of deep vein thrombosis after elective hip surgery. A randomized trial comparing low molecular weight heparin with standard unfractionated heparin OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative efficacy and safety of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (Enoxaparin) compared with standard calcium heparin for the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. PATIENTS: Six hundred sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing hip replacement at five participating hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either fixed-dose LMW heparin, 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily, or fixed-dose standard calcium heparin, 7500 units subcutaneously twice daily; both regimens were started 12 to 24 hours after surgery and continued for 14 days or until discharge if sooner. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had postoperative I-125-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. If results of one or both tests were positive, then venography was done. Otherwise, venography was done between day 10 and day 14, or sooner if the patient was ready for discharge. RESULTS: Evaluable venograms were obtained in 258 of the 333 patients randomly assigned to receive LMW heparin and in 263 of the 332 patients assigned to receive calcium heparin. For patients with evaluable venograms, thrombosis was detected in 50 patients (19.4%) who received LMW heparin compared with 61 patients (23.2%) who received standard heparin (difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -11.1% to 3.6%) (P greater than 0.2). Proximal deep vein thrombosis was detected in 5.4% of the patients receiving LMW heparin and in 6.5% of the patients receiving standard heparin (difference, -1.1%; CI, - 5.2% to 3.3%) (P greater than 0.2). For the entire group of 665 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 17.1% given LMW heparin and in 19.0% given standard heparin. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 31 patients (9.3%) given standard heparin and in 17 patients (5.1%) given LMW heparin (difference, 4.2%; CI, 0.3% to 8.2%) (P = 0.035). The relative risk reduction was 45%. The rate of major bleeding in the standard heparin group was 5.7% compared with 3.3% in the LMW heparin group (difference, 2.4%; CI, -1.0% to 5.4%) (P = 0.13). The relative risk reduction was 42%. CONCLUSION: Low molecular weight heparin is significantly less hemorrhagic than standard unfractionated heparin; the difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, although not statistically significant (P greater than 0.2), favors the use of LMW heparin. 
Posterior semicircular canal occlusion in the normal hearing ear. This report outlines our experience with posterior semicircular canal occlusion, a new operative procedure for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We postulate that the resulting solid canal "plug" prevents endolymph movement within the posterior canal, which effectively fixes the cupula. This selectively abolishes the receptivity of the posterior canal to both angular acceleration and gravity without influencing the other inner ear receptors. We previously reported the success of this procedure in two patients with BPPV and a co-existing profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. Since that report, a slightly modified technique has been used to occlude six more posterior canals--five in normal hearing ears. While our follow-up times range from only 3 to 18 months, all eight patients continue to be relieved of their BPPV. Temporary mixed hearing losses occurred in three of the five ears with normal preoperative hearing. Hearing in all five patients ultimately returned to the preoperative state. We believe this procedure is a simpler and safer alternative to singular neurectomy for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. 
Characterization of human renal fibroblasts in health and disease: I. Immunophenotyping of cultured tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts derived from kidneys with histologically proven interstitial fibrosis. Recently, it has been shown that inflammatory and noninflammatory glomerular diseases are often complicated by changes in the tubulointerstitial system, mostly caused by renal interstitial fibrosis (IF). To analyze pathomechanisms of these tubulointerstitial lesions, growth behavior and expression of cell surface molecules of tubular epithelial cells and renal fibroblasts in culture, established using renal biopsies of IF, were studied. Furthermore, the capacity of renal fibroblasts in culture to produce extracellular matrix was investigated. Expression of MHC-class II antigens on proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) has been induced by supplementing the culture medium with interferon gamma. Renal fibroblasts, the major cell types growing out from renal biopsies with interstitial fibrosis, form so-called hillocks in culture and synthesize collagen type I, III, and V. Further analysis using cocultures of tubular epithelial or renal endothelial cells on the one hand, and defined renal fibroblasts on the other, will clarify the interaction between these cell types, which probably will lead to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms causing disease progression. 
Asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria in children. The clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and subsequent course in 53 children with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria were studied retrospectively (1) to determine the prevalence of renal pathologic abnormalities among these children, (2) to identify those clinical characteristics that may enable recognition of children with an increased likelihood of having renal pathologic abnormalities, and (3) to assess the clinical course. All biopsy specimens were examined by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Twenty-five patients (47%) had significant glomerular changes (15 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 4 IgA nephropathy, 3 diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without IgA deposition, and 3 membranous glomerulonephritis), and 28 had minimal glomerular changes. There were no differences between the patients with significant glomerular changes and those with minimal glomerular changes with regard to clinical and laboratory findings except for a predominance of boys in the former group. At the latest follow-up, seven patients with significant glomerular changes, but none with minimal glomerular changes, had chronic renal impairment. Because of the high incidence of significant glomerular changes and the high rate of progression to chronic renal impairment, we believe that a renal biopsy is indicated for a child with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria. 
Single lung transplantation. Alternative indications and technique. Twenty-two patients have undergone 23 single lung transplants between March 1980 and April 1990 at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The actuarial survival rate is 77.27% at 12 months and 72.73% at 24 months. There have been no instances of bronchial dehiscence or stenosis, even though 13 of the patients were on a program of preoperative prednisone, every patient had high-dose perioperative methylprednisolone, and omental wraps were not used on any bronchial anastomosis. Of particular interest is the fact that three patients had primary pulmonary hypertension, three had secondary pulmonary hypertension, and 10 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due in five cases to an alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Each of these entities was previously thought to contraindicate single lung transplantation. Donor selection was based on an oxygen tension/inspired oxygen concentration ratio greater than 300, donor/recipient chest circumference within 3 inches, clear chest x-ray film, negative sputum Gram stain, and less than 6-hour estimated ischemic time. Harvest technique included donor prostaglandin E1 500 micrograms, topical slush, and pulmonoplegia with cold Euro-Collins solution. The heart and lung were separated in situ rather than the heart lung block being removed. A telescoping bronchial anastomosis was performed with 4-0 Prolene (not absorbable) sutures. We conclude that single lung transplantation has evolved into a simple operation, necessitating meticulous preoperative and postoperative care, which can be performed on a wide spectrum of critically ill patients with an acceptable mortality rate. 
Long-term survival analysis in hereditary hemochromatosis. This study investigated the long-term survival rates of 85 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Eighty-five patients with documented hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosed between 1958 and 1989 and followed up at the University Hospital (University of Western Ontario) medical center were retrospectively reviewed for this analysis. The current status of the patient was assessed by interview or written questionnaire completed by the patient or the family physician. Estimates of differences in survival rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier life-table and Cox regression analysis. Liver histology, clinical features of the disease, and number of venesections were analyzed to determine their relationship to survival. In the course of a mean follow-up interval of 8.1 +/- 6.8 years (range, 0-31 years), there were 17 deaths among the 85 hemochromatosis patients. Patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis were 5.5 times more likely to die than noncirrhotic patients. Patients who were noncirrhotic at the time of diagnosis had an estimated survival that was not significantly different from age- and sex-matched members of the normal population. Diabetes did not increase the risk of death after data were controlled for the presence of cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis in the precirrhotic stage can lead to long-term survival similar to that in the general population. The presence of cirrhosis significantly increases mortality and is the major clinical factor affecting survival. 
Premenstrual syndrome. Because researchers are still seeking the cause of PMS, we cannot recommend a single treatment approach that will work satisfactorily with all women who have the syndrome. Investigators have made progress, however, toward defining and diagnosing the condition. We also can help women whose lives are disrupted each month by prescribing specific approaches to symptom management. 
Ifosfamide, Fanconi's syndrome, and rickets. Three of 218 children treated with ifosfamide plus the uroprotectant mesna, in single- or combination-agent protocols, have developed Fanconi's renal syndrome, all of whom were in a subgroup of 86 children who had also received cisplatin or carboplatin therapy. Patients receiving ifosfamide who have received prior cisplatin (or carboplatin) are at significantly higher risk of developing Fanconi's syndrome than are those who have received no prior nephrotoxic therapy (P = .04). The role of prior nephrotoxic therapy, including cisplatin and its derivatives, and the total dose of ifosfamide should be considered in the assessment of this rare but serious and apparently irreversible side effect. 
Gastric antral vascular ectasia associated with gastric carcinoma. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), or watermelon stomach, is an uncommon cause of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. Although GAVE has not previously been reported in association with gastric cancer, it is often associated with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia, which are known risk factors for gastric malignancy. We report a 72-yr-old woman with pernicious anemia who was found to have GAVE associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the gastric cardia and adenocarcinoma in situ of the pylorus. In view of recent reports of the use of endoscopic modalities rather than surgical resection to treat GAVE, our case alerts endoscopists to the possibility of coexisting carcinoma. 
Adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy for superficial bladder cancer. In 1990, bladder cancer, excluding carcinoma in situ, was estimated to contribute 49,000 cases of cancer. In men 75 years old or older, it became the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Of patients with bladder cancer, 75%-80% initially present with superficial bladder tumors. Treatment of these tumors has three objectives: 1) to eradicate existing disease, 2) to provide prophylaxis against tumor recurrence, and 3) to avoid deep invasion into the muscle layers of the bladder. Transurethral resection is the primary treatment to eradicate superficial bladder tumors, but 40%-80% of these tumors recur. Because of these high recurrence rates, adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with cytotoxic and immunomodulatory drugs has gained widespread use. The past two decades of clinical investigations in superficial bladder cancer have provided valuable information on the biology and treatment of the disease. Multivariate analyses have indicated that tumor grade and stage are the most important prognostic variables commonly available to the clinician to identify the patient at greatest risk of developing muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer. These studies have also identified groups at low risk for tumor recurrence and invasive bladder cancer. Randomized trials have shown that recurrence rates are decreased by adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with a number of drugs: bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), doxorubicin, ethoglucid (Epodyl), mitomycin-C, teniposide, and thiotepa. However, few studies indicate that adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy can prevent progression to invasive bladder cancer in the high-risk patient with superficial bladder cancer. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether such therapy can prevent invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and improve disease-free survival in this group. In addition, the identification of tests (e.g., monoclonal antibody tests, chromosomal analyses, and tumor marker assays) that can help to identify high-risk patients is needed to better develop therapeutic strategies for superficial bladder cancer. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the scrotum: case report and literature review. Malignant melanoma of the scrotum is the rarest of primary genitourinary melanomas, with only 3 cases reported previously. We present an additional case of this often aggressive malignancy. The pertinent literature is reviewed and the current management strategies are discussed. 
A controlled study of the effectiveness of spot dermabrasion ('scarabrasion') on the appearance of surgical scars. We report the results of a controlled study on the use of spot dermabrasion ("scarabrasion") on surgical scars. In a split scar model, linear scars produced by full-thickness surgical excisions on the face, trunk, and extremities were studied in 48 patients. Results of abrasion of the left (top) half of each scar were compared with the untreated right (bottom) half. Although scars were improved at 4 and 6 weeks after injury, a significantly greater number responded to abrasion at 8 weeks (p less than 0.05). All regions of the body showed comparable improvement. The diamond fraise was found to be an effective instrument for scarabrasion. 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome associated with endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary. Both EST and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome are uncommon disorders. This report illustrates a case of these two rare conditions occurring in the same patient. Patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, although not appearing to be at increased risk for germ cell tumors, unlike testicular feminization patients, are not immune to ovarian cancer. Therefore, individuals with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome should still be followed gynecologically because they are at least at the normal risk of developing ovarian as well as other gynecological neoplasms. 
Thrombolysis in refractory unstable angina. Multiple drug therapy, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, aspirin, and heparin, has been advocated as effective in the treatment of unstable angina, a syndrome with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Recently, plaque rupture and thrombosis have been demonstrated as the most important pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, clear-cut results on the effects of thrombolytic treatment in unstable angina are still lacking. Some possible explanations why the medical treatment of unstable angina has still not yet been standardized, whereas that of myocardial infarction has, are suggested. A review of randomized and nonrandomized studies published on this topic evaluating the role of different thrombolytic agents in unstable angina is presented. In addition the role of coronary angiography is discussed. In view of the disappointing results of coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the acute phase of the disease, one of the goals of clinical research is to identify subsets of patients at high and low risk and who undergo different types of therapeutic interventions. To support published data suggesting that total myocardial ischemia has a significant impact on prognosis, we present our results of a study carried out on patients with refractory unstable angina treated with thrombolytic therapy and evaluated with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the attempt to correlate total myocardial ischemia with short-term prognosis. Data in favor of the prognostic role of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in unstable angina are also reviewed. Finally, we propose some suggestions that might be useful for future studies. 
Emergency department treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures with phenytoin. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Prevention of recurrent alcohol withdrawal seizures is a common emergency department problem. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of adequate size was designed to assess the efficacy of phenytoin in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. METHODS: Fifty-five patients who had seized from alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment with IV phenytoin or placebo. Patients with known seizure disorders and those receiving any anticonvulsant were excluded. The study was terminated after seizure recurrence or passage of a six-hour, high-risk seizure interval. RESULTS: Six of 28 phenytoin-treated patients (21%) had recurrent seizures compared with five of 27 placebo-treated patients (19%). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response probabilities was +16% to -20%. There was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (P greater than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin does not show significant benefit over placebo in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. 
Natural history of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history and disease progression of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and to assess the therapeutic effects of orally administered steroids on the disorder as of October 1990. DESIGN: Case-series analysis. A cohort of 45 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was followed prospectively by periodic telephone interviews and medical examinations for an average of 14 months after onset of illness. SETTING: Washington state. PATIENTS: The cases of 47 patients were reported to the Washington State Department of Health from 1 July to 12 December 1989. Two patients were unavailable for follow-up, and the remaining 45 completed the study. MAIN RESULTS: Patients were predominantly non-Hispanic white women (87%) with an average age of 49 years. Symptoms typically progressed from early onset of myalgia and fatigue to later development of neurologic and scleroderma-like skin changes. Six (13%) patients recovered completely within 2 to 5 months of symptom onset. After 14 months of illness, over half of the patients who initially presented with myalgia, fatigue, or scleroderma-like skin changes remained symptomatic. The average severity of each major symptom was measured using interviews and patient self-reports and has improved subjectively by at least 40%. Statistical analyses showed no significant difference in long-term symptom duration or severity between patients treated and those not treated with prednisone. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a long-term illness characterized by progressive improvement during the first 25 weeks after symptom onset, followed by a protracted phase of symptom resolution. We could not show a clear-cut benefit of prednisone in reducing the long-term severity or duration of the disease. 
Leptomeningeal dissemination of optic pathway gliomas in three children. We treated three children with optic pathway gliomas who had progressive disease associated with metastatic spread to the leptomeninges. One patient had radiographic resolution of leptomeningeal disease after treatment with intravenous carmustine and oral mercaptopurine but died of progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The second patient was treated with intravenous thiotepa, and the leptomeningeal disease remained stable. The third patient was treated with intravenous vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide and had a significant size reduction of the leptomeningeal lesion. Although leptomeningeal dissemination is a seemingly rare event, it is important that all children with optic pathway gliomas be considered for this possibility, particularly after the onset of new, atypical neurologic symptoms. 
Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma. Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls. Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia. Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function. 
Interpretation of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference in patients with hypercapnia. According to conventional wisdom the difference between alveolar and arterial O2 tensions, the AaPO2, should distinguish between hypoxemia caused by alveolar hypoventilation and hypoxemia caused by alveolar hypoventilation complicated by other abnormalities of gas exchange. To test this concept we have calculated the AaPO2 from arterial blood gas measurements, breathing air, in 23 patients with hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and advanced obstructive lung disease (mean FEV1 = 0.88 L). We found that AaPO2 varied inversely with PaCO2 (r = -0.83, p less than 0.001). In five of these patients with the most severely elevated PaCO2 (range, 59 to 81 mm Hg) the AaPO2 was within normal limits. We also calculated the difference between the O2 contents of "ideal" pulmonary capillary blood and arterial blood and expressed this as the venous admixture (QVA/QT) based on an assumed arteriovenous content difference of 4.5 ml/dl. In contrast to the AaPO2, the QVA/QT, was abnormal in all patients (mean = 41 +/- 8%). We conclude that the AaPO2 may be an unreliable indicator of abnormal gas exchange in the presence of alveolar hypoventilation. This finding can be explained by substantial changes in the position of the alveolar and arterial points on the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin in the presence of alveolar hypoxia secondary to hypoventilation. 
Preoperative prostate-specific antigen in predicting pathologic stage and grade after radical prostatectomy. Preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured in 63 men who had clinically localized, previously untreated adenocarcinoma of the prostate and underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Pathologic stage and grade were correlated to the serum PSA value. Patients with organ-confined (P1, P2) and extracapsular (P3, P3N +) prostate cancer had elevated preoperative serum PSA levels (greater than 4 ng/mL) in 61 and 90 percent of cases, respectively. Patients with low-grade and high-grade tumor histology had elevated preoperative PSA levels in 62 and 80 percent of cases, respectively. In distinguishing between organ-confined and extracapsular disease with a preoperative serum PSA of 10 ng/mL as a cutoff value, the sensitivity was 68 percent, the specificity was 66 percent, the positive predictive value was 46 percent, and the negative predictive value was 83 percent. Although there was a trend of increasing preoperative serum PSA levels with higher pathologic stage or grade, there was no significant difference in preoperative serum PSA values with pathologic stage and/or grade considered as a group or in determining stage and/or grade preoperatively on an individual basis. 
A population-based study on the incidence and survival rates of 3857 glioma patients diagnosed from 1953 to 1984. Intracranial glioma was diagnosed during the patient's life and histologically verified in 3857 patients between 1953 and 1984 in Finland. Their survival up to the end of 1987 was analyzed, the follow-up being complete. The treatment was by operation in 1193 cases, radiation in 459 cases, both operation and radiation in 1486 cases, and neither operation nor radiation in 719 cases. The 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year cumulative relative survival rates were 0.53, 0.29, 0.20, and 0.18, respectively. The newborn to 14-year-olds lost 56% of their life expectancy; the 15-year-olds to 44-year-olds, 71%; the 45-year-olds to 64-year-olds, 88%; and the 65-year-olds to 99-year-olds, 91%. According to the model with the best fit in regression analysis the prognosis was significantly better among young, recently diagnosed patients who had undergone both operation and radiation. 
Thermal effects and histologic changes from Nd:YAG laser irradiation on normal and diseased aortic tissue using a novel angioplasty catheter with a mobile optical fiber: an in vitro assessment. Although various laser angioplasty devices are currently being examined, thermal damage and perforation of the vessel wall remains the major acute complication of vascular laser recanalization. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the thermal effects and histologic changes from laser irradiation (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm) on normal and diseased aortic tissue using a novel angioplasty device. During laser emission the coaxially guided optical fiber tip was positioned in reference to the end hole of the metallic capped probe as follows: (1) at the end hole (metal-cap position), (2) protruding 10 mm from that end hole (bare-fiber position), (3) withdrawn 5 mm into the metal cap's lumen (hot-tip position). In total, 96 laser impacts (25 joule: 5 W, 5 s, each) were produced on normal and atherosclerotic aorta in air through a 0.2-mm-core-diameter silica quartz fiber, with direct contact on the intimal surface of the target tissue by both the fiber and the metal cap and by either the fiber or the metal cap (n = 32 each). Tissue temperature was measured by means of special sensors positioned opposite the irradiated intimal spot in direct contact with the adventitial surface. Morphohistologic evaluation of lesions was performed and injury indexes were determined. 
Use of a chlorhexidine dressing to reduce microbial colonization of epidural catheters. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a chlorhexidine dressing in reducing the microbial flora at the insertion site of epidural catheters. These catheters were used for acute pain management and were dressed either by a standardized method or with a CHX/urethane sponge composite. Microbial colonization of the catheter developed in 9 of 31 controls (29.0%) and 1 of 26 (3.8%) catheters with the CHX dressing (P less than 0.05%). The CHX dressing caused no adverse effects. The data suggest that delivery of antiseptic to the catheter wound site reduces catheter colonization with a possible reduction in the risk of epidural catheter-related infection. 
Development of human neural transplantation. The possibility of altering the course of Parkinson's disease by brain grafting is slowly becoming a reality through the efforts of many research groups worldwide. It has been shown that this procedure, as performed in high-level medical research centers, usually produces no permanent adverse effects and can effectively ameliorate parkinsonian signs in certain patients. This progress has served to reinforce our commitment to develop neural transplantation into an effective therapy to treat such a devastating neurodegenerative disease. We have summarized the most important events that have shaped the initial phase of this research. In the course of the last 4 years, considerable knowledge has been gained in the clinical neurosciences regarding the real potential of various brain grafting procedures in treating Parkinson's disease, their shortcomings, and their usefulness in carefully selected patients. There is still no consensus regarding the various fundamental aspects of human brain grafting in Parkinson's disease. Questions concerning surgical technique, candidate selection, the optimal brain regions for implantation, the optimal tissue for implantation, and the real usefulness of brain grafting must be addressed. The importance of the quality of adrenal medulla fragments for grafting, the requirement for immunosuppressors in fetal brain grafting, and the optimal fetal age and the amount of donor tissue for effective grafting are additional areas of concern. The potential of xenografting, preserved tissues, and genetically engineered cells for human brain grafting remain unanswered. The development of human neural transplantation is the responsibility and privilege of neurosurgery. 
Peritoneal endometriosis: endometrial tissue implantation as its primary etiologic mechanism. The mechanisms involved in primary implantation of pelvic endometriosis were investigated in women undergoing laparoscopy as part of an infertility evaluation. Among the women with a diagnosis of endometriosis, those with no observed lesions in the ovaries and no adhesions in the pelvic cavity were classified as being in stage I. These women were further subdivided into two groups: the stage Ia group in which implants were found in one area (25 women) and the stage Ib group in which implants were found in two or more areas (29 women). In both groups the most frequent site was the uterosacral ligaments followed by the posterior uterine serosa, the posterior cul-de-sac, and the posterior broad ligaments in that order. Regardless of the position of the uterus, endometriosis was found significantly more frequently in the posterior compartment. The finding that the most frequent implants on the uterosacral ligaments were near the tubal ostium and, in the stage Ia group, the absence of implants on the anterior uterine serosa but a 33% frequency on the posterior uterine serosa, which is more frequently exposed to menstrual blood, suggest that implantation of endometriosis is the result of retrograde menstruation. However, the possibility that metaplasia of the serosal epithelium is stimulated by menstrual blood cannot be ruled out, inasmuch as the process of implantation in the peritoneum has not yet been proved. 
Experimental hemorrhage and blunt trauma do not increase circulating tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent cytokine mediator of the shock states associated with sepsis and burn injury. This experimental study was done to determine whether circulating TNF plays a major role in the vasomotor collapse seen following experimental hemorrhage and blunt injury. Twenty anesthetized pigs were divided into two groups. Ten animals were bled 60% of their calculated blood volume in 15 minutes. Animals in Group IA (n = 5) had no treatment, and Group IB animals (n = 5) were given twice the shed volume as crystalloid 30 minutes after hemorrhage. The other animals, groups IIa and IIb (n = 5 each), were first subjected to a blunt injury to the thigh sufficient to cause a midshaft femur fracture, then bled and similarly treated. In both groups, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and serum TNF activity by L929 bioassay were measured at 15-minute intervals for 120 minutes after hemorrhage or hemorrhage and blunt injury. An additional three animals were infused with 4 x 10(8)/kg heat-killed E. coli to validate the TNF assay. All bled animals sustained a fall in MAP and CO to a mean of 33% of baseline values, with or without fracture. Group IB and IIB animals responded to fluid resuscitation by restoration of MAP and CO to 85%-97% of the baseline values. Tumor necrosis factor was not detectable before injury and remained undetectable in all these animals during the 120 minutes of the experiment despite hemorrhage alone or combined hemorrhage and blunt trauma, with or without fluid resuscitation. The test animals receiving the E. coli responded with markedly elevated TNF levels, which peaked at 90 minutes after injection. 
Effect of disc degeneration at one level on the adjacent level in axial mode. Nonlinear three-dimensional finite element models of a ligamentous two motion segments spine specimen (L3-L4-L5) were developed to investigate the effects of disc degeneration, simulated at the L4-L5 level, on the biomechanical behavior of the adjacent intact L3-L4 motion segment. The disc degeneration was simulated by removing the hydrostatic capabilities of the nucleus and making the L4-L5 disc stiffer than a normal disc. The results of the degenerated model were compared with the predictions for a model in which the L4-L5 disc was left intact. The loads on the facets decreased, and intradiscal pressure in the intact L3-L4 disc increased as a result of disc degeneration compared with the intact model. The predicted increase in the intradiscal pressure and the associated increase in the disc bulge in the posterior region over time may trigger the degenerative process at the L3-L4 motion segment. This is in accordance with the Wolff's law; living tissue responds to chronic changes in stresses and strains. The limitations of the present two motion segments model and the potentials of multisegmental models are discussed. 
Immunological evidence for the co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis in two patients. Two patients are described in whom a clinical and electromyographic diagnosis of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was made. Serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), the antigenic target in LEMS and to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the antigen in myasthenia gravis, were detected at raised titres in both cases, using radioimmunoassays based on 125I-omega-Conotoxin labelled VGCCs and 125I-alpha-Bungarotoxin labelled AChRs. These data provide immunological evidence for the coexistence of the two disorders in these patients. 
Cancer risk among staff at two radiotherapy departments in Denmark. In comparison with the general Danish population, the relative risk (RR) for cancer among staff members employed in two radiotherapy departments in Denmark during 1954-1982 and alive on 1 April 1968 was assessed by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. All staff had been monitored with film dosimeters for exposure to radiation. The study cohort consisted of 4151 persons, accruing 49553 person-years at risk. The collective radiation dose was 76.54 manSv and the mean dose 18.4 mSv. A total of 163 cancer cases were observed with 152.3 expected. The risks for cancers usually considered to be radiogenic were not elevated. A significant excess of prostatic cancer was observed (five cases, relative risk, 6.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-14.06); this is likely to be a chance finding. No relation was observed between radiation dose or years of exposure and cancer risk, but a weak non-significant increase in risk with time since first exposure was seen. 
The economic implications of high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysms. Financial data of 102 patients undergoing elective and emergent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over a 3-year period were evaluated in terms of postoperative length of stay, net revenue, total standard cost, and net margin. Cost reimbursement was based on diagnosis related group payments. Aneurysm repairs were classified as emergent, high-risk elective, or low-risk elective. A net loss of $409,459 was noted for the entire series. Emergent repairs, although only 12% of the population, accounted for 73% of total losses, with a mean loss of $24,655/patient. The mean net loss in the high-risk elective group was $3590/patient, and a net gain of $1132/patient was noted in the low-risk elective group. Length of stay outliers, defined as length of stay greater than 28 days, contributed to the bulk of the losses in the elective series and were predominant in the high-risk group. No preoperative comorbidity, other than high-risk classification, predicted outlier status. Length of stay correlated with total standard costs in all categories of aneurysm repair. Third party payment for length of stay outliers was inadequate; the diagnosis related group system warrants revision so that outlier reimbursement will be based on a tiered system derived from length of stay. 
Lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic spine. The upper thoracic vertebrae are difficult to approach surgically because of the narrowing of the thoracic inlet, the proximity of the brachial plexus, and the parascapular shoulder musculature. A novel lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic vertebrae is described. The parascapular shoulder musculature (trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles) is reflected off the spinous processes to the scapula as a musculocutaneous flap, preserving the neurovascular supply. The paraspinal musculature is mobilized and retracted, and the upper dorsal ribs are removed with caution to avoid injury to the C-8 and T-1 nerve roots. The rami communicantes are transected, and the sympathetic chain is displaced anterolaterally. The T2-4 vertebrae can be approached unobstructed. The T-1 nerve root obstructs posterolateral access to the T-1 vertebra, necessitating an inferolateral approach underneath the T-1 nerve root axilla. Four patients with compressive myelopathy from upper thoracic vertebral metastases underwent neural decompression, vertebral reconstruction, and posterior spinal fixation with this approach. Their postoperative neurological status was either unchanged or improved. Complications included radiographic pleural effusion and superficial wound dehiscence; one patient required posterior spinal reinstrumentation for progressive kyphosis. One patient developed pneumonia 7 days postoperatively which was unresponsive to appropriate treatment. It is believed that the anatomical limitations to this region have been overcome, and that excellent exposure of the T1-4 vertebrae for neural decompression and vertebral reconstruction can be performed safely. A major advantage is that posterior spinal fixation can be carried out simultaneously. 
Wound complications after modified radical mastectomy compared with tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy (TAD) has become an accepted treatment for early breast cancer and has been shown to result in equal 5- and 8-year survival when compared with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). In order to determine the safety of TAD with respect to wound complications and to identify potential risk factors, we reviewed the charts of 560 patients undergoing MRM (n = 387) and TAD (n = 173) at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 1983 through 1989. The incidence of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared, and obesity, age 60 years or older, smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the MRM group versus the TAD group (49% versus 35%; p less than 0.01), specifically more seromas (29% versus 18%; p less than 0.01) and epidermolysis (18% versus 0%). In the MRM group, age 60 years or older was associated with seroma (p less than 0.01) and smoking was associated with epidermolysis (p less than 0.01). In the TAD group, obesity was associated with infection. In both groups, volume of drainage from closed suction wound drains greater than 30 mL in the 24 hours prior to removal of the last drain was associated with seroma (p less than 0.05). 
The NACI Registry: an instrument for the evaluation of new approaches to coronary intervention. The NACI Investigators. The New Approaches to Coronary Intervention (NACI) Registry was developed to collect in-depth data about patients whose coronary artery lesions are being treated with new interventional techniques such as atherectomy, stents, and laser devices. The NACI Registry database distinguishes among several possible "modes" for device use, such as preparatory, planned definitive, and bailout use. Common definitions are used for data collection across all devices, and device-specific forms are used to record procedural details. NACI's unique modular form design facilitates thorough data collection, even for the most complex treatment scenarios. The database structure allows for data analysis at the patient, procedure, lesion, and device levels, as required to perform in-depth analyses of the immediate and long-term success of new devices. Once adequate knowledge of basic device performance has been collected, the Registry structure can also allow expeditious planning and performance of randomized trials comparing a new device to conventional PTCA. 
Transgenic oncogene mice. Tumor phenotype predicts genotype. The hypothesis that oncogenes influence tumor phenotype was tested by examining slides from 607 mammary tumors from 407 transgenic mice bearing the ras, myc, and/or neu oncogenes. Most tumors (91%) had patterns (phenotypes) that could not be classified by Dunn's standard nomenclature. The nonstandard tumors were described as eosinophilic small cell (SC), basophilic large cell (LC), or pale intermediate cell (IC). The SC tumor was associated with ras, the LC was associated with myc, and the IC was associated with neu, with specificities more than .90 and sensitivities ranging from .99 to .48. Thus, the tumor phenotype could be used to predict which oncogene was present in the animal. The presence of myc in combination with either ras or neu resulted in the predominance of LC tumors and accelerated tumorigenesis. The combination of ras and neu resulted in a decreased tumor incidence. Thus, knowledge of the oncogenes that were present could be used to predict the natural history of the disease. 
Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum. A case of squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum with no underlying duplication or inflammatory disorder is described. The neoplasm seemed to have originated from the surface epithelium, invading the wall and metastasising to the regional lymph nodes. The 65 year old patient was free of disease three years after having had the tumour removed. Previous reports of squamous carcinoma of the small intestine have been associated with intestinal duplication or metastatic disease from distant sites. 
Induction of hemoglobin synthesis by downregulation of MYB protein with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. Reduced expression of the proto-oncogene c-myb appears necessary for erythroid differentiation induced by chemical agents and by the natural regulator, erythropoietin (Epo). Treatment of Epo-responsive Rauscher erythroleukemia cells with an anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-myb in the absence of other inducers downregulated myb protein markedly and caused hemoglobinization of the cells within 48 hours. Epo treatment, which downregulates c-myb in these cells, induced hemoglobinization to the same degree. Epo also induced the appearance of anion transport protein on the plasma membrane, consistent with terminal differentiation. In contrast, antisense c-myb did not induce this erythroid marker. The results are consistent with a role for myb protein in the regulation of hemoglobin synthesis. 
Heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with multiple congenital hemangiomas--a case report. Congenital protein C deficiency is described as associated with recurrent thrombotic manifestations. The proband, a fourteen-year-old female, has a history of severe and frequent thrombotic disease, moreover, she presents congenital multiple hemangiomas. Family history was positive for protein C deficiency since the mother of the proposita is also affected and has manifested deep venous thrombophlebitis. Two additional relatives on the maternal side were not available for study but were reported to be symptomatic. None of the family members presented angiomatosis. This case report represents the first description of the association of protein C deficiency with multiple hemangiomas. 
Intratracheal injection of endotoxin and cytokines. II. Interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor beta inhibit acute inflammation. The nature of the endogenous mediators that down-regulate and curtail the exodus of neutrophils into local acute inflammatory sites is unknown. In the present report, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), members of a family of macrophage-derived proteins known as cytokines, are shown to inhibit significantly the acute neutrophilic exodus caused by an intratracheal injection of endotoxin (LPS), a proinflammatory component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. Transforming growth factor beta (10 micrograms) and IL-6 (10 micrograms) coinjected intratracheally with LPS (10 micrograms) each inhibited the number of neutrophils in 6-hour bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens by approximately 50%. The intratracheal coinjection of IL-6, TGF beta, and LPS inhibited the LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammatory exodus by nearly 75%. Interleukin-6 also is shown to be endogenously upregulated within the lung after intratracheal challenge with endotoxin, providing evidence that IL-6 may represent an endogenous negative feedback mechanism to inhibit endotoxin-initiated cytokine-mediated acute inflammation. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta both strongly inhibited the quantity of TNF-alpha recovered in the BAL fluid of LPS-challenged rats, suggesting that downregulation of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production within the lung represents one mechanism whereby IL-6 and TGF beta exert an antiinflammatory action. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta represent novel pharmacologic and, probably, endogenous inhibitors of acute inflammation. 
Multiple pilomatricomas and myotonic dystrophy. Multiple pilomatricomas are rare. However, among patients with myotonic dystrophy, the occurrence is higher. The authors report a patient, to their knowledge the 11th case of multiple pilomatricomas associated with myotonic dystrophy, to emphasize that these tumors may be associated with the disease. 
Problems encountered in leg shortening. We reviewed 46 leg-shortening operations (37 femoral and nine tibial), performed by different methods, to assess the incidence of complications and permanent disability. Shortening of as much as 7.5 cm in the femur and 5 cm in the tibia was achieved in men of normal height without any loss of function. Complications were seen with all surgical techniques despite the use of modern implants. Most problems arose from inadequate stabilisation of the osteotomy. The most reliable method of femoral shortening was open subtrochanteric osteotomy with preservation of the isthmus, and fixation with an intramedullary nail locked at its proximal end. In tibial shortening, bone excision should be at the level of the flare in the lower diaphysis in order to achieve reliable bone healing. Simple intramedullary nail fixation should be supplemented with a long-leg cast for six weeks or the nail should be locked at both ends to prevent postoperative distraction or rotation. 
Estrogen and progesterone receptors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and sclerosing hemangioma of the lung. The therapeutic options in the treatment of lung neoplasia usually have not included hormonal therapy, unlike those for primary tumors of other sites (e.g., breast). However, two mesenchymal proliferations of lung, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), and one epithelial tumor, sclerosing hemangioma (SH), have a significant female predilection and may benefit from such hormonal therapy. The authors investigated five cases each of EHE and lymphangioleiomyomatosis and four cases of SH for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and 17-beta estradiol in paraffin-embedded tissue. Only one case each of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and EHE expressed 17-beta estradiol. All of the other cases were negative. These findings are contrary to the viewpoint held in published literature, especially in case reports of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, describing patients with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor results. Consequently, a number of issues must be considered in the clinical and immunohistochemical evaluation of the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of these rare pulmonary neoplasms. 
Stapes surgery: complications and airway infection. From a group of 1,111 patients who had stapedectomy or stapedotomy performed in a 10-year period, a thorough investigation was made of 11 patients who had a total hearing loss and 8 patients who developed a partial sensorineural hearing loss after operation. The data obtained indicate that postoperative infection with influenza virus may be responsible for unexpected complications following stapedectomy. A close relation was found between the appearance of complications and periods of epidemics of influenza. 
Surgical management of perilymph fistulas. A new technique. A wide range of recurrence rates (21% to 47%) for perilymph fistula repairs have been reported in the otology literature. An improved surgical technique developed at the Portland (Ore) Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center Neurotology Department was used to repair perilymph fistulas in 58 patients from October 1986 to October 1988. Our recurrence rate was reduced from 27% in a 1982-1985 study to 8% in our study. At 1 year postoperatively, improvements in disequillibrium, dizziness, and vertigo were comparable with results of older surgical techniques. Functional outcomes were also good: 83% of patients returned to normal activities of daily living, and 71% also returned to school or resumed gainful employment outside the home. 
Serum testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio and CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio (T:DHT) and the antigenic marker CA 19-9 were studied in the serum of 21 male patients with pancreatic cancer and 62 controls with other gastrointestinal malignancies or benign pancreatobiliary disease. Specificity of the T:DHT ratio was 98%, significantly better than the specificity of CA 19-9 at both a 37 U/ml cutoff level (61%) and at 100 U/ml (79%). Sensitivity of the T:DHT ratio was 67%, and that of CA 19-9, 71% and 90% at the upper and lower cutoff levels, respectively. False-negative results of the T:DHT ratio were found predominantly in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer, whereas all four stage I patients had an abnormal (less than 5) T:DHT ratio. These results suggest that the T:DHT ratio is a useful marker for pancreatic cancer in males. It can be used alone or in combination with CA 19-9, and should be further evaluated in the differential diagnosis of patients with the early stages of this disease. 
Unsuspected sphincter damage following childbirth revealed by anal endosonography. Anal endosonography was performed in 62 consecutive patients with incontinence of flatus or faeces following obstetric trauma, and in 18 parous controls. Of the incontinent group, 90% had defects in the external sphincter, 65% in the internal sphincter and 44% disruption of the perineal body, compared with none of the controls. This triad of lesions is pathognomonic of obstetric trauma. Anal endosonography revealed a higher prevalence of sphincter damage than expected from anorectal physiology tests, and therefore has a role in screening patients following complicated or difficult deliveries. 
Tuberculosis diagnosed at death in the United States. From 1985 through 1988, 5.1 percent of TB cases reported in the United States were diagnosed at death. Differences in the proportions diagnosed at death by race/ethnicity, sex, and place of birth (United States vs foreign-born) were relatively small. The proportion of cases diagnosed at death increased with age, from 0.7 percent in patients less than 5 years old to 18.6 percent among patients 85 years and older. Only 26.0 percent of cases diagnosed alive were among those 65 years and older, but 60.3 percent of those diagnosed at death were in this age group. Eighteen percent of cases with miliary, meningeal and peritoneal TB were diagnosed at death, compared with 4.8 percent among those with pulmonary TB. These data indicate that TB too often remains unrecognized and that, to prevent continuing deaths from this curable disease, a high index of suspicion of TB remains important, particularly among the elderly and among persons with extrapulmonary sites of disease. 
Potential for mosquito transmission of attenuated strains of Rift Valley fever virus. Studies were conducted to determine if two attenuated strains of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus could be transmitted by Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Both strains (RVF MP 12 and T1) replicated in and were transmitted by female Cx. pipiens after intrathoracic inoculation. Mosquitoes also became infected with and transmitted the RVF MP12 strain after ingesting virus from a blood-soaked cotton pledget. However, because of the low viremias produced in infected animals, it is unlikely that mosquitoes would become infected by feeding on an animal inoculated with either of these viruses. Although both strains were transmitted by mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation, there was no evidence of reversion to a virulent virus. 
Fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised children with neoplasms. This paper reviews the treatment and diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with fungal sinusitis at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Sinusitis of all types was found to be more common in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms than in patients with solid tumors; 42% of patients with leukemia had abnormal sinus radiographs. Eight cases of pathologically proven fungal sinusitis were identified. All patients were undergoing chemotherapy for either acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had neutrophil counts less than 100 cells/mm3. The most common findings were fever, facial pain, and abnormal sinus radiographs. Surveillance cultures of the upper aerodigestive system did not reliably predict sinus pathogens. An aggressive treatment approach consisting of early administration of amphotericin B (intravenously and via catheter irrigations of the sinuses) and surgical drainage is advocated. There was an 80% survival rate in patients in remission who were undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. All patients undergoing chemotherapy for relapse died. 
Evolving experience with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair at a single institution. Fifty-seven patients underwent repair of atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms between 1978 and 1990. Five patients had urgent surgery for rupture. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity. 
Thoracic outlet syndrome caused by tumor of the first rib. We report a new case of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by a tumor of the first rib and review 11 other reports found in the literature. A 25-year-old man was admitted with thoracic outlet syndrome in the C8-T1 nerve roots. The first rib was removed through a supraclavicular approach with excision of the medial clavicle. All symptoms disappeared. On histologic examination fibrous dysplasia was found in the rib. Tumors of the first rib are uncommon and are rarely responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. When the tumor is very large, as in our case, we recommend a supraclavicular approach associated with excision of the medial clavicle. During the liberation of the brachial plexus, great care should be exercised to avoid nerve injuries. Because malignancy of the tumor cannot be eliminated with certainty before or during the operation, wide excision of the entire rib is recommended. 
Small bowel tumours: yield of enteroscopy. A total of 258 patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were referred for small bowel enteroscopy, a procedure which allows endoscopic evaluation of most of the small intestine. A small bowel tumour was found in 5% of patients. In 50% of patients no diagnosis could be made, but when the cause of obscure bleeding was discovered small bowel tumours were the single most common lesion in patients younger than 50 years. Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative. 
The relationship between esophageal motility disorders and microvascular angina. Patients with unexplained chest pain have caused investigators in cardiology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry to find abnormalities with overlap among the three specialties. This article reviews the data concerning the potential interrelation of chest pain of cardiac or esophageal origin. 
Prevention of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, multicenter trial comparing norfloxacin with ciprofloxacin. The GIMEMA Infection Program. Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in preventing bacterial infection in neutropenic patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats. DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups). ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients. 
Treatment of systemic vasculitis with pooled intravenous immunoglobulin. The therapeutic effect of a course of high-dose, pooled, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on disease activity and circulating antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was investigated in 7 patients with systemic vasculitis. 5 had active disease despite conventional immunosuppression, and 2 had not received any treatment. All 7 had clinical improvement, which was sustained in 6 and transient in 1. The fall in ANCA concentrations to a mean of 51% of the pre-treatment values was maintained during follow-up. C-reactive protein concentration also dropped considerably. IVIg seemed to confer a useful therapeutic effect without adverse reaction. 
Malignant melanoma in transgenic mice. Ocular and cutaneous melanomas arose in new inbred lines of transgenic mice having an integrated recombinant gene comprised of the tyrosinase promoter, expressed in pigment cells, and the simian virus 40 early-region transforming sequences. The tumors were hypomelanotic and were histopathologically similar to corresponding human melanomas. Eye melanomas often originated at a young age, chiefly from the retinal pigment epithelium, also from the choroid, and rarely from the ciliary body. The eye tumors grew aggressively, were highly invasive, and metastasized to local and distant sites. The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin melanomas arose later and less frequently than eye melanomas. Hence they were at early stages and of unknown long-range incidence in this investigation, in which autopsies covered the first half-year of life. For both ocular and cutaneous melanomas, the transgenic mice offer numerous possibilities for experimental study of mechanisms underlying formation and spread of melanomas. 
Crohn's disease associated with autoimmune neutropenia. We report a 29-year-old woman with a 20-year history of Crohn's disease and neutropenia. Because of repeated complications of Crohn's disease, she has undergone three intestinal resections and also has had recurrent skin abscesses, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Persistent neutropenia has been noted throughout the course of her disease, and antineutrophil antibodies have been detected in her serum and that of her younger brother, who also has Crohn's disease and neutropenia. We discuss autoimmune neutropenia in the context of other autoimmune manifestations of Crohn's disease and speculate as to its possible contributory role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. 
Preferential DNA secondary structure mutagenesis in the lagging strand of replication in E. coli. When present in single-stranded DNA, palindromic or quasi-palindromic sequences have the potential to form complex secondary structures, including hairpins, which may facilitate interstrand misalignment of direct repeats and be responsible for diverse types of replication-based mutations, including deletions, additions, frameshifts and duplications. In regions of palindromic symmetry, specific deletion events may involve the formation of a hairpin or other DNA secondary structures which can stabilize the misalignment of direct repeats. One model suggests that these deletions occur during DNA replication by slippage of the template strand and misalignment with the progeny strand. The concurrent DNA replication model, involving an asymmetric dimeric DNA polymerase III complex which replicates the leading and lagging strands, has significant implications for mutagenesis. The intermittent looping of the lagging strand template, and the fact that the lagging strand template may contain a region of single-stranded DNA the length of an Okazaki fragment, provides an opportunity for DNA secondary-structure formation and misalignment. Here we report our design of a palindromic fragment to create an 'asymmetric palindromic insert' in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of plasmid pBR325. The frequency with which the insert was deleted in Escherichia coli depends on the orientation of the gene in the plasmid. Our results suggest that replication-dependent deletion between direct repeats may occur preferentially in the lagging strand. 
Endocrine response determines the clinical outcome of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction in different ovulatory disorders. To accrue systematic information in different ovulatory disorders on the precise relationship among endocrine response, clinical outcome, and the occurrence of complications, we treated 114 patients with pulsatile GnRH (2.5-5.0 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) for 187 cycles and compared them to 20 normal menstrual cycles. Thirty of these patients had primary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (PHA; 40 cycles), 33 had other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; 55 cycles), and 51 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 92 cycles). Daily blood samples were drawn for hormone determinations. In PCOS, 50 cycles were preceded by GnRH analog suppression. PHA treatment cycles were characterized by the reestablishment of a normal endocrine pattern, almost no dose-related endocrine differences, elevated ovulatory (93%) and conception rates (23%), and no multiple pregnancies. In the HH subjects the ovulatory (91%) and pregnancy rates (31%) were high; however, while the lower GnRH dose elicited a normal endocrine pattern, the 5-micrograms dose induced excessive folliculogenesis and high estradiol levels and was associated with most of the multiple pregnancies of this study (three of four). GnRH analog suppression was successfully used to avoid recurrence of ovarian over-stimulation in two HH subjects. Finally, GnRH analog suppression in PCOS permitted normalization of the follicular phase endocrine pattern, achievement of good ovulatory (76%) and pregnancy (28%) rates, and avoidance of multiple pregnancies; however, luteal phase steroid secretion was abnormal, and the abortion rate remained elevated (43%). Obesity was associated with a reduced ovulatory rate in PCOS, but not in hypogonadotropic, subjects. Thus, we can conclude that in pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction: 1) a profound hypogonadotropic condition, whether spontaneous as in PHA or induced with GnRH analogs as in other ovulatory disorders, is associated with optimal menstrual cycle restoration, high ovulatory and conception rates, and virtually absent risks of multiple pregnancy; 2) residual hypothalamic activity in HH may be responsible for supraphysiological pituitary-ovarian stimulation and result in multiple pregnancy unless a low GnRH dose (2.5 micrograms/bolus) or GnRH analog pretreatment is employed; 3) obesity does not affect treatment outcome in hypogonadotropic patients; and 4) the high spontaneous abortion rate in PCOS may be related to corpus luteum dysfunction. 
Symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition. Its clinical significance and treatment. The clinical significance of symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition was described subjectively, objectively, and identified roentgenographically after examining 67 feet of 42 patients between 1977 and 1987. Computed tomographic examinations, conducted on 29 of 42 patients, were useful in recognizing the extent of coalition, the condition of union, and the postoperative results. Tarsal tunnel syndrome was present in 23 feet with the coalition. Thirty-one feet (24 patients) were treated conservatively and 36 feet (29 patients) surgically. Of the surgically treated feet, the coalition was excised in 33 and talocalcaneal fusion was performed in three. Follow-up examinations were performed at an average of 5.3 years (range, 2.25-11.2 years). In the excision group, the results were excellent in 24 feet, good in seven, and fair in two. The results were good in three feet treated by arthrodesis. 
Gallstone formation after rapid weight loss: a prospective study in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for treatment of morbid obesity. The present study evaluated the incidence of gallstone formation in 105 morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss after proximal gastric bypass surgery. Intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrated gallstones in 20 (19%) and gallbladder sludge in four (4%) patients. Eighty-one patients had a normal gallbladder ultrasound. After bariatric surgery, these patients were followed prospectively with periodic gallbladder ultrasound examinations. At 6 months, gallstones had developed in 36% and gallbladder sludge in 13% of patients. These percentages remained relatively constant at 12 and 18 months. Body weight declined rapidly after surgery from a mean of 132.3 kg to 95.5, 87.0, and 84.0 kg at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Gallstones developed significantly more often in the white race, and in women. No significant differences in age, body weight, percent ideal body weight, percent weight loss, or percent of excess body weight lost existed between patients who developed gallstones or sludge and those who did not. Patients who developed gallbladder sludge had less cholesterol and lower cholesterol saturation (1.25 +/- 0.42) in their gallbladder bile than persons who developed gallstones (2.00 +/- 0.79). Forty percent (13/32) of patients who developed gallstones became symptomatic; nine (28%) underwent elective cholecystectomy. An attempt to prevent gallstone formation during rapid weight loss appears warranted. 
HIV-1 propagates in human neuroblastoma cells. A major question in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy and dementia is whether HIV-1 directly infects cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The propagation of HIV was attempted in six cell lines: three related and three unrelated to the nervous system. HIV was able to propagate in two human neuroblastoma cell lines and a lymphocytic cell line control but did not result in infections of African green monkey kidney cells, human cervix carcinoma cells, and one human brain astrocytoma cell line. Neuroblastoma cell lines infected with HIV showed peaks of reverse transcriptase activity at 10-14 days postinfection. After prolonged growth in cell cultures, one of the neuroblastoma cell lines showed multiphasic virus production, additional high peaks of reverse transcriptase activity, 20-fold greater than the first, lasting from 36 to 74 days and 110 to 140 days postinfection. The presence of HIV was confirmed by p24 antigen capture. The neuroblastoma cell lines had weak but detectable levels of CD4 immunoreactivity by immunoperoxidase and flow immunocytometric analysis. Although no T4-specific RNA sequences were detected by hybridization of Northern blots of total and poly A-selected RNA extracted from the two neuroblastoma cell lines by using a T4 specific complimentary DNA probe, monoclonal antibodies to the CD4 receptor blocked HIV infection in both neuroblastoma cell lines. Thus, the infection of neuroblastoma cells by HIV occurs in part by a CD4-dependent mechanism. Passaging the neuroblastoma cell lines weekly and bimonthly resulted in similar cell cycle-DNA content patterns for the more permissive cell line and with significant numbers of cells in the S phase. HIV-infected neuroblastoma cell lines provide an in vitro model for the evaluation of virus-host cell interactions and may be useful in addressing the issue of the persistence of HIV in the human CNS. 
Patterns in visual interpretation of coronary arteriograms as detected by quantitative coronary arteriography. In part 1 of a three-part study, 14 novice readers and 6 experienced cardiologists interpreted phantom images of known stenosis severity. No difference between the interpretations of experienced and novice readers was detectable. Visual estimates of "moderately" severe stenosis were 30% higher than actual percent diameter stenosis. In part 2 of the study, visual interpretation of percent diameter stenosis from 212 stenoses on 241 arteriograms was compared with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment. The visual analysis overestimated disease severity in arteries with greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis (except for right coronary lesions) and underestimated severity in all arteries with less than 50% diameter stenosis. Of the 241 arteriograms, 40 had quantitative and visual analysis of all three coronary arteries for assessment of significant disease. In only 62% of the cases did visual and quantitative methods agree on the presence of severe disease; visual estimates diagnosed significantly (p less than 0.05) more three-vessel disease. In part 3 of the study, comparison of percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment before and after balloon angioplasty of 38 stenoses showed that visual interpretation significantly (p less than 0.001) overestimated initial lesion severity and underestimated stenosis severity after angioplasty. 
Stress gastritis revisited. In current ICU populations, overt bleeding from stress gastritis occurs in 10% to 20% of patients. Bleeding rates may be reduced to about 3% in patients receiving prophylactic therapy. Although patients with bleeding have higher mortality rates than other critically ill patients, it is not clear that the mortality rate is improved with prophylactic therapy, as most patients die from their underlying disease. As new complications of prophylactic therapy are identified, better definitions of the population at risk to develop complications of stress gastritis will be necessary to select those patients who will benefit most from prophylactic therapy.
