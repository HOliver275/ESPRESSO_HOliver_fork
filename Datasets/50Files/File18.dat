3	Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. 
5	Effects of vasopressin on portal pressure during hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Vasopressin is often used to treat variceal hemorrhage. However, its efficacy is uncertain, and its portal hemodynamic effects in this setting are unknown. Eleven patients with alcoholic liver disease and bleeding varices were given vasopressin (0.2 U/min for the first hour, then 0.4 U/min for 24 hours). Portal pressure was monitored using an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter. Seventeen patients with variceal bleeding who remained stable over 26 hours of initial treatment with crystalloid and blood products served as a comparison group. Vasopressin infusion (0.2 U/min) produced a significant decrease in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient (wedged minus free hepatic venous pressure), and heart rate. Increases in the rate of infusion did not produce further decreases in the parameters measured, but the changes were sustained over the course of the infusion. Hemodynamics remained stable in the control group. Portal pressure did not increase when vasopressin was abruptly discontinued in the 3 patients in whom postinfusion measurements were made. Vasopressin retains its portal hypotensive effects in the setting of variceal hemorrhage. Tachyphylaxis does not develop over 26 hours, and a "rebound" increase in portal pressure probably does not occur when the infusion is discontinued. 
2	Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. 
5	Surgical aspects of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is associated with the administration of beta-blocking agents as well as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The predisposing factors in the latter group are recurrent peritonitis, presence of acetate in the dialysate, and antiseptics used during bag exchanges. We report a case of SEP following chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and review the literature on this benign yet potentially lethal condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis frequently leads to intestinal obstruction, small-bowel necrosis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and malnutrition. There is a high incidence of anastomotic failure when a resection and primary intestinal anastomosis is performed in patients with SEP. Although SEP is not commonly reported in the surgical literature, its importance to surgeons is indicated by the fact that the overall mortality rate is close to 60% in patients with SEP who develop surgical complications. 
5	Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood. 
1	Chondrosarcoma complicating total hip arthroplasty in Maffucci's syndrome. A 70-year-old woman who was followed for 60 years for Maffucci's syndrome required a total hip arthroplasty (THA) of the right hip for degenerative arthritis. This did not relieve pain. Three years later, chondrosarcoma of the femur developed around the femoral component and was fatal. The roentgenographic changes after the THA were incorrectly interpreted as being caused by infection. 
5	Amenorrhea. Amenorrhea, the lack of menstruation, is a gynecologic disorder that may arise from a variety of causes. If a logical and orderly schema is followed, the correct diagnosis and appropriate management plan can be formulated. 
4	Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery. Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005). 
4	Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis. Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. 
1	Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the liver. A distinct clinicopathologic entity. A malignant rhabdoid tumor occurring as a primary hepatic neoplasm in a six-month-old white infant is reported. It was treated by an attempt at total resection involving right hepatic lobectomy and by chemotherapy with cis-platinum, VP-16, and Adriamycin. Despite this, recurrence of the tumor resulted in the girl's death within three months. The neoplasm showed typical light microscopic features of malignant rhabdoid tumor as well as filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions by electron microscopic examination and staining for both cytokeratin and vimentin by immunohistochemistry. The classic clinicopathologic features of this tumor support the concept that malignant rhabdoid tumors similar to those of the kidney may occur in extrarenal sites. 
4	Do we need another antihypertensive agent? The factors to be considered in selecting antihypertensive agents have traditionally centered around balancing efficacy against adverse side effects. The former can be achieved by a variety of agents alone or in combination. The latter not only involves safety but is also concerned with whether an otherwise safe agent is tolerated by the patient so compliance with the treatment regimen can be achieved. A relatively new consideration is how antihypertensive agents affect other disease states that may or may not be associated with hypertension. For example, how a drug may affect diabetes, gout, myocardial hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and coronary events must be evaluated. These concerns taken together answer the question of why yet another antihypertensive agent may be needed in the pharmacologic armamentarium. 
3	Intraocular pressure and the rate of visual field loss in chronic open-angle glaucoma. We measured the rate of change of visual field threshold values over time (mean follow-up, 44.9 +/- 17.4 months) by trend analysis in 40 eyes of 40 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Twenty-eight eyes had stable visual fields, and two eyes had significant visual field improvement. Ten eyes had significant visual field deterioration and showed a correlation between indices of intraocular pressure (standard error of the mean, P = .02; standard deviation, P = .04; and range, P = .05) and the rate of visual field loss in the superonasal region of the visual field, such that the greater the variation of intraocular pressure the greater the rate of loss. The group losing visual fields had a higher mean visual field threshold value and significantly less optic disk pallor and cupping at the start of the study than the stable visual field group. Thus, a significant rate of visual field loss occurred at an earlier stage of the disease and showed a correlation with intraocular pressure in this stage. 
4	Surgical treatment of active native valve endocarditis. A report is presented of 24 patients (23 male), mean age 38 years, who underwent surgery for active native valve endocarditis of the left heart in 1975-1988. The aortic valve was affected in all patients, and also the mitral valve in five. Pre-existing aortic valve disorder was present in 17 cases (13 congenitally bicuspid 4 rheumatic affection). There were five hospital deaths (20.8%). Staphylococci as causal organism and extensive infection predicted the highest mortality and morbidity. The mean follow-up time was 39.7 (range 2-114) months. Two reoperations because of prosthetic valve dehiscence revealed endocarditis of the implanted valve. Strong correlation was found between favourable postoperative course and rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels, which did not fall in patients with persistent infection. Early surgery is recommended if the course of bacterial endocarditis is severely complicated. 
5	Isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding an autoantigen recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine. 
1	Continuous infusion carboplatin on a 21-day schedule: a phase I and pharmacokinetic study. A phase I study with continuous infusion carboplatin for 21 days every 6 weeks using a venous access port and portable pump was performed over a dose range of 12 to 32 mg/m2/d, with increments of 2 mg/m2/d. Forty-four patients received 107 courses (median, two; range, one to nine). World Health Organization (WHO) grade III/IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in one of seven patients at 30 mg/m2/d, and in two of six and four of six patients at 32 mg/m2/d. Cumulative platelet depression was found at dose levels of 28 mg/m2/d or more. Median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow, monitored by radioisotope clearances at doses greater than or equal to 20 mg/m2/d, decreased 8.2% (P less than .05) and 10.9% (P less than .01) after two courses. There was a relationship (r = .50, P less than .0002) between the percentage of platelet depression and GFR. No other toxicity was observed. Of the 17 patients who were evaluable, one complete response and four partial responses were observed. In addition, six patients had stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis of total and ultrafiltrable platinum (UFPt) was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Steady-state plasma levels for UFPt were reached after 8 hours. These levels could be detected from the 20 mg/m2/d dose. During steady state, carboplatin dose and UFPt plasma levels were not correlated, but steady-state UFPt and GFR (r = -.27, P less than .05) were. Twenty-four percent of total platinum (Pt) was present as UFPt during steady state (x = 160 +/- 10 micrograms/L). Total body clearance of UFPt exceeded GFR 2.2 times. Mean area under the curve (AUC) for UFPt during continuous infusion was 4,921.8 +/- 301.72 mg.min/L. For total Pt, steady-state plasma levels were not reached; total Pt plasma levels increased between day 7 and day 21 (P less than .0001). There was a significant relation between total Pt serum levels day 7, 14, and 21 and the drug dose administered. Immunohistochemical analysis of DNA-bound Pt in leukocytes showed a linear increase from day 7 to day 14 to day 21 (r = .97) between DNA-bound Pt and duration of infusion in individual patients. The maximum-tolerable dose of carboplatin is 30 mg/m2/d for 21 days (total dose 630 mg/m2) and is recommended for phase II studies. 
5	Vasopressin and oxytocin responses to illusory self-motion and nausea in man. Vasopressin and oxytocin are nonapeptides secreted from the neurohypophysis; increases in vasopressin are associated with nausea and vomiting in some, but not all, species. Our aim was to determine whether plasma vasopressin and oxytocin levels were altered in healthy volunteers who did or did not develop nausea during vection, an optokinetic stimulus which produces the illusion of self-motion. Vection was produced by rotating a drum with an inner surface of black and white vertical stripes around the seated stationary subject. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded continuously throughout the experiment with electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface. Plasma samples were obtained before vection and after drum rotation stopped when nausea and tachygastria were present. Vasopressin and oxytocin were extracted from plasma and quantified by RIA. During vection six subjects reported nausea and developed gastric dysrhythmias; six other subjects had no nausea and remained in normal 3-cpm myoelectrical rhythms. Vasopressin and oxytocin values before vection were similar in each group of subjects. One minute after vection stopped, plasma vasopressin levels were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in subjects experiencing nausea and tachygastrias (35.4 +/- 26.7 pmol/L) than in those without symptoms (2.7 +/- 0.47 pmol/L). Oxytocin levels were unchanged by either vection or nausea. It is concluded that 1) vasopressin, not oxytocin, neurons in the magnocellular-neurohypophyseal system are activated during vection-induced nausea and gastric dysrhythmias; and 2) illusory self-motion may be used safely to study the neuroendocrine responses to brain-gut interactions and nausea in man. 
2	Gallstone lithotripsy: relevant physical principles and technical issues. A basic understanding of shock wave generation is essential for the radiologist who performs gallstone lithotripsy. Shock waves differ from ordinary acoustic waves in that they have a rapid rise time, a positive pressure component that gives rise to compressive forces approaching 1,000 atm, and a low-amplitude sustained negative pressure (rarefactive) component. Shock waves are created by means of three different types of shock wave generators: spark-gap, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric. The authors describe and compare these three types of shock wave generators with regard to equipment selection. Regardless of how shock waves are generated, they share common interactions with tissue. These interactions are reviewed along with the proposed mechanisms of stone fragmentation. 
4	Changes in left ventricular diastolic performance after aortic balloon valvuloplasty: acute and late effects To evaluate acute and follow-up changes in left ventricular diastolic performance, simultaneous digital left ventriculography and micromanometry were performed in 49 patients undergoing aortic balloon valvuloplasty. All patients improved symptomatically after valvuloplasty, and 26 returned 6.3 +/- 1.5 months later for follow-up catheterization. Immediately after valvuloplasty, aortic valve area increased (before 0.5 +/- 0.2 versus after 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm2, p less than 0.01), cardiac output (before 4.3 +/- 1.2 versus after 4.4 +/- 1.3 liters/min) and ejection fraction (before 51 +/- 18% versus after 52 +/- 17%) did not change and diastolic indexes worsened, signified by a decrease in peak filling rate (before 247 +/- 80 versus after 226 +/- 78 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and increase in the time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (tau) (before 78 +/- 29 versus after 96 +/- 40 ms, p less than 0.01) and the modulus of chamber stiffness (before 0.107 +/- 0.071 versus after 0.141 +/- 0.083, p less than 0.01). At follow-up catheterization, 16 patients continued to have symptomatic improvement (group 1) and 10 had recurrence of symptoms (group 2). Aortic valve area, cardiac output and ejection fraction at follow-up catheterization in both groups were similar and unchanged from values before valvuloplasty. 
5	Pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst This report describes a case of symptomatic pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst in a 25-year-old woman. The literature on pituitary hemorrhage in nonadenomatous sellar tumors is reviewed. 
4	Coronary lesion morphology in acute myocardial infarction: demonstration of early remodeling after streptokinase treatment Coronary lesion morphology was analyzed in 72 patients 1 to 8 days after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction and compared with lesion morphology in a control group of 24 patients with stable angina. In the streptokinase group the infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). Compared with stenoses in the stable angina group, there were no differences in the stenosis length, severity, calcification or in the proportion located at an acute bend or at a branch point. However, lesions in the streptokinase group were more often irregular (p less than 0.005) and eccentric (p less than 0.01), had a shoulder (p less than 0.0001), globular filling defects (p less than 0.01), linear filling defects (p less than 0.00005) and contrast staining (p less than 0.05). Plaque ulceration index was higher in the streptokinase than in the stable angina group (6.2 +/- 7.9 versus 3.5 +/- 3.4, p less than 0.001). Of the 72 streptokinase-treated patients, 35 were maintained on heparin infusion until angioplasty 2 to 10 days later. At repeat angiography before angioplasty, globular lesion filling defects seen in eight patients had disappeared, whereas linear filling defects persisted in 7 of 14 cases. Fewer lesions were irregular (p less than 0.0001) and the ulceration index decreased from 7.4 +/- 10.4 to 3.0 +/- 1.6 (p less than 0.001). These data show that the lesion in the infarct-related artery after streptokinase treatment is irregular and often associated with filling defects, perhaps corresponding to plaque fissuring and intraluminal thrombosis. 
3	Ultrastructural evidence of a merocrine secretion in the human endolymphatic sac. The results of a light and transmission electron microscopic analysis of an endolymphatic sac (ES) from a patient suffering from episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented. A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus. The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material. Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis. Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted. This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways. An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed. Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES. The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one. 
4	Simultaneous measurement of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function during exercise from a single injection of technetium-99m sestamibi in coronary artery disease. New radiopharmaceuticals permit simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function using a single tracer injection. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the relation between myocardial perfusion and function at rest and during exercise in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). A rest first-pass radionuclide angiocardiogram (RNA) was recorded in 51 patients with CAD during injection of 10 mCi of technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi, and tomographic perfusion images were obtained 60 minutes later. A treadmill test was then performed, and on attainment of an exercise end point a second first-pass RNA was recorded with 30 mCi of Tc-99m sestamibi. Tomographic images reflecting myocardial perfusion during exercise were obtained 1 hour later. Tomographic perfusion defect size, quantified using modifications of the Cedars-Sinai program, correlated directly with end-systolic volume and inversely with ejection fraction at rest and during exercise. However, perfusion defect size often varied widely in patients with similar left ventricular function. This independence between measurements of perfusion and function suggests that simultaneous assessment of the 2 physiologic variables could improve the diagnostic and prognostic information of radionuclide tests. 
5	Susceptibility to Coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic myocarditis maps near the murine Tcr alpha and Myhc alpha loci on chromosome 14. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic control of host susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced chronic myocarditis in a mouse model. An autosomal recessive autoimmune myocardial disease (amd) gene (possibly more than one gene), which determined susceptibility to CVB3-induced chronic myocarditis in the A/J and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains, was mapped to a segment of chromosome 14. Data from both the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains and the B10.D2(57N) H-8b congenic mice supported this linkage relationship. Analysis of the AXB/BXA RI strain distribution patterns suggested that amd maps distal to the Np-2, Tcr alpha, and Myhc alpha loci. 
5	Soft tissue sarcoma with additional anaplastic components. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 27 cases. This clinicopathologic study concerns 27 cases of "dedifferentiated" soft tissue sarcoma (DSTS), including 14 liposarcomas, six leiomyosarcomas, five chondrosarcomas, and two rhabdomyosarcomas. In addition, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical survey of 23 cases and an electron microscopic examination of three. The findings were compared with observations of 32 cases of de novo malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). All tumors contained additional distinct anaplastic portions indistinguishable from MFH under conventional light microscopy, ultrastructurally, and in cases of immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin and on lectin histochemical findings for ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin agglutinin. The desmin reactivity present in anaplastic portions of 14 DSTS and in eight de novo MFH is taken to mean that myofibroblasts are present in these tumors. The anaplastic components of DSTS are presumed to represent the proliferation of another clone of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that fail to differentiate along any specific lineage other than fibroblast-like cells, histiocyte-like cells, and myofibroblasts. Nineteen patients died of tumor and four are alive and well 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, and 5.2 years after the initial treatment, respectively. 
4	Recognition of hypertension and abnormal blood pressure burden with ambulatory blood pressure recordings in type I diabetes mellitus. Ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) measurements were obtained at 20-min intervals for 24 h in 25 subjects with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus and 21 control subjects. The diabetic patients had normal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate 112.1 +/- 7.2 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, renal plasma flow 459.0 +/- 23.4 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) and were normotensive according to standard sphygmomanometer examinations. Mean +/- SE AMBP (systolic/diastolic in mmHg) measurements in diabetic patients (24 h, 131.7/77.2 +/- 2.9/1.8; 0600-2200, 132.3/78.4 +/- 2.9/3.4; 2200-0600, 125.1/75.7 +/- 3.9/3.4) significantly exceeded control values during all times (24 h, 121.8/70.3 +/- 2.9/1.9; 0600-2200, 120.7/71.8 +/- 2.6/2.0; 2200-0600, 108.2/61.5 +/- 6.6/2.7). Mean 24-h AMBP exceeded 135/85 mmHg in 49% of diabetic patients. The same threshold of 135/85 mmHg was used to determine the prevalence of abnormal measurements per time period (pressure burden). Pressure burden was increased twofold in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. Mean AMBP was significantly reduced at night in control subjects but not in diabetic patients. Changes in blood pressure were not related to kidney function in diabetic patients. AMBP recordings uncovered an increased prevalence of abnormal mean blood pressure, increased pressure burden, and a lack of diurnal variation of blood pressure in subjects with type I diabetes mellitus. These findings have important implications for early intervention strategies in diabetes mellitus because AMBP recordings correlate well with end-organ damage. 
4	Improved cannulation method for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been shown to be useful for patients in reversible cardiogenic shock. Effective arterial cannulation techniques for infants have been developed that are simple to use and require minimal subsequent vascular repair or reconstruction after removal. Groin cannulation in adults frequently requires bidirectional arterial cannulation to ensure adequate distal perfusion as well as frequent complex arterial repairs after discontinuation. We describe a simple arterial cannulation technique using a single right-angle, high-flow arterial cannula. With this technique adequate bidirectional arterial perfusion is maintained with a single arterial cannula while the need for vascular repairs or reconstruction is minimized. 
5	Nuclear sclerotic cataract after vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal membranes causing macular pucker. We evaluated the occurrence or progression of nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens in 100 eyes after vitrectomy for removal of idiopathic epiretinal membranes causing macular pucker. The follow-up period ranged from six to 99 months (average, 29 months). Visually significant nuclear sclerosis was present preoperatively in three of the operated on eyes and four of the fellow eyes. The rate of occurrence or progression of visually significant nuclear sclerosis was far greater in the operated on eyes (P less than .0001). Of 100 patients, 80 operated on eyes and 24 fellow eyes had visually significant nuclear sclerosis or had undergone previous cataract extraction at the conclusion of the study. Different concentrations of glucose in the intraocular irrigating solution did not affect occurrence of later nuclear sclerosis. Patients older than 50 years of age had a far greater incidence of later nuclear sclerosis than patients younger than 50 years of age (P = .0003). Nuclear sclerosis may be caused by altered lens metabolism after removal of part of the vitreous gel, since nuclear sclerosis also occurs in other conditions associated with vitreous liquefaction. 
3	Electroencephalography should not be routine in the evaluation of syncope in adults We reviewed the reports of all electroencephalograms obtained at the Nashville (Tenn) Veterans Administration Hospital from September 1987 to August 1989. Seventy-three patients were referred for evaluation of syncope or near syncope. Of these 73 patients, 10 (13.7%) had abnormal findings. Twenty-six patients were referred for other complaints similar to syncope (ie, blackouts, loss of consciousness, falling out, passing out, and fainting). Of these 26 patients, five (19.2%) had abnormal findings. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with abnormal findings and found that the final diagnosis or treatment of the syncope was affected by electroencephalogram in only one patient. These findings suggest that routine electroencephalography is not of significant value in the evaluation of syncope in adults. 
5	Recurrence of resected esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: results of re-resection. Isolated local recurrence following potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction does not necessarily imply pending systemic disease and early demise. While radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy is standard treatment for such patients, resection is another available option. Resection may also be a consideration should localized disease persist after non-operative therapy in the absence of metastases. A 5 year retrospective review was performed examining 204 resections performed prior to 1989. Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period. No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected. One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence. Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients. Although there were no postoperative deaths, major complications occurred in 4 patients. All 5 patients swallowed normally after operation. 
3	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Although the cause of IIH remains obscure, loss of visual function is common, and patients may progress to blindness. Diagnosis should adhere to the modified Dandy criteria. Recent case-control studies cast doubt on the validity of many frequently cited conditions associated with IIH. Valid associations include obesity, recent weight gain, female sex, vitamin A intoxication, and steroid withdrawal. Management should include serial perimetry using a sensitive disease-specific strategy so the proper therapy can be selected and visual loss prevented or reversed. 
4	Interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress in young adults. The interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity was studied in white and black young adults aged 18-23 years. The cardiovascular response to difficult mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of oral sodium loading (10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet). A sodium-sensitive blood pressure response occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion occurred in the sodium-sensitive group (r = - 0.28, p less than 0.01). High sodium intake did not augment blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population, which was grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity. 
5	Nuclear techniques for the analysis of urinary calculi. Sections of urinary calculi were prepared and point-by-point analyses along a line-scan were carried out using the techniques of proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). Correlations between several pairs of elements (including trace elements) were noted and it was also clear that the composition of a stone varied markedly at different stages of development. 
4	Angiographic morphology in unstable angina and its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome. Complex stenosis morphology frequently occurs in patients with unstable angina pectoris. However, its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome has not been ascertained. To address this issue, 88 patients with significant (greater than or equal to 50%) coronary artery disease presenting with angina--new onset (n = 38), worsening (n = 20) or at rest (n = 30)-were studied. Patients with left main artery disease, normal coronary arteries or occlusion of the ischemia-related arteries were not included in the study. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were obtained during the first 24 hours. Angiography was performed within 1 week from admission. Complex morphology was defined as any stenosis with irregular borders, overhanging edges or intracoronary thrombus. Only data referring to the in-hospital outcome were considered in this study. Adverse end points were sudden death, myocardial infarction and emergency revascularization. Analysis of the angiograms revealed a complex morphology in 58 patients (group 1). The remaining 30 patients served as control subjects (group 2). Thirty-two of the 58 group 1 patients had an unfavorable clinical outcome (positive predictive value, 55%). A similar outcome occurred in only 2 of the 30 group 2 patients (negative predictive value, 93%). Of the 32 group 1 patients who had an unfavorable clinical outcome, 29 had a cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia of greater than or equal to 60 minutes per 24 hours. A similar duration of ischemia, however, was observed in another 6 group 1 and in 8 group 2 patients. 
4	Effects of doxazosin on blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and urinary kallikrein. Doxazosin, a new quinazoline-derivative postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was studied in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. Its effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, metabolic functions and renal hormones were analyzed after administration of a single oral morning dose in a 3-phase fashion when administered to 17 patients (11 women, 6 men, 21 to 59 years) with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. After titrating the antihypertensive effective dose biweekly from 1 to 8 mg/day and a mean end titration-point dose of 4.14 +/- 0.1 mg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at week 8 of treatment, it was adjusted to maintain diastolic BP at levels less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for up to 12 weeks of treatment when, at a final mean dose of 4.35 +/- 0.2 mg/day, BP decreased in all patients by a mean 31 +/- 3/17 +/- 2 (supine) and 39 +/- 3/15 +/- 3 (standing) mm Hg (p less than 0.005) with no increase in heart rate and no "first-dose phenomenon." Neither the renin-aldosterone system nor electrolyte excretion was significantly affected. Renal function and metabolic parameters also remained unchanged. Urinary kallikrein excretion was augmented 2.47-fold (p less than 0.002). There was good tolerance; 1 patient discontinued the study because of dry nose. These results suggest that long-term monotherapy with doxazosin is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent for mild to moderate essential hypertension that stimulates urinary kallikrein excretion. 
1	Radiographic manifestations of congenital anomalies affecting the airway. Congenital anomalies of the airway are generally uncommon, but a vast array of possibilities exists. Some present life-threatening emergencies at birth, and others go undiagnosed for years. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, and radiographic evaluation is frequently requested to localize and characterize the lesion before endoscopy, surgery, or medical management. The most common intrinsic congenital anomalies causing airway compromise in infants include choanal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, laryngomalacia, vocal cord paralysis, and congenital subglottic stenosis. The radiologist must be on the alert for unsuspected additional anomalies involving the airway, lungs, and esophagus, which occur with relative frequency. Numerous extrinsic congenital masses of the head, neck, and mediastinum may compromise the airway. Hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and teratomas are more likely to be noted at birth, whereas branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct anomalies, and dermoid cysts frequently present later. Mass location and radiographic characteristics usually allow accurate preoperative diagnosis. Intracranial involvement by nasal or nasopharyngeal masses, intrathoracic involvement by lower neck mass, and intraspinal involvement by posterior neck mass must always be sought for radiographically. Persistence of respiratory symptoms after removal of such masses is not uncommon because tracheal deformity and laxity may take months or years to resolve. Recent advances in cine CT and MR imaging promise to improve imaging of the airway in general and in the pediatric population in particular. Significant limitations in imaging of the pediatric larynx remain. As a result, endoscopy continues to be the primary diagnostic tool for airway anomalies of this region. 
5	Electrocardiographic ambulatory monitoring with a real-time analysis system. The analysis of records collected during long-term ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has traditionally involved the review of massive data, either manually or with the aid of interactive scanning computers. Many factors complicate this analysis, including the use of analog tape for storage of electrocardiographic waveforms, the need to analyze 100,000 waveforms from an average 24-hour study, and the need to deal with an interface that compresses 24 hours of data into as little as 6 minutes on a screen. Today, the computer incorporated in the monitor can scrutinize each cardiac cycle in real time. The system produces a statistical report based on every heart beat and also performs data reduction and storage of electrocardiograph samples. To assess real-time analysis we examined data collected from the Circadian CircaMed ambulatory electrocardiography system. We found that it could detect and quantify simple or complex ventricular ectopic beats, brady- or tachyarrhythmic events, and ST-segment deviation. One hundred fifty patients 21 to 85 years old with symptoms or clinical finding suggestive of ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, or conductive defects were referred to our electrocardiography laboratory for ambulatory monitoring. The results demonstrate that this system can detect the full range of cardiac disease found with the traditional method. Of the 150 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic tests were positive in 93 (62%). In addition, we developed a methodology for lead placement when using two bipolar leads, as is typical for ambulatory electrocardiography. We present a procedure for determining the optimum lead placement that is based on the patient's history and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. 
1	Invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. A patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis died of intracranial invasion by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A biopsy of clinically normal skin had revealed perineural invasion by malignant keratinocytes. Because SCCs arising in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis may be biologically aggressive, it is best to excise them with careful control of the surgical tissue margins. 
5	Retinal infarction during sleep and wakefulness. Brain and retinal infarctions during sleep have been attributed to focal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension combined with underlying arterial stenosis, rather than to embolism. Because some retinal emboli may be visualized on ophthalmoscopy, we studied 24 consecutive patients (18 men and six women) aged 26-78 (mean 58) years with recent retinal infarction and determined whether the infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. All patients underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy and a carotid artery study (arteriography in 20, duplex ultrasound in the remaining four), and 12 had echocardiography. Retinal infarction occurred during sleep at an unexpectedly rate (14 of 24 observed compared with eight of 24 expected, p = 0.02). Retinal cholesterol emboli were seen in one half of the patients regardless of whether the retinal infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. Carotid artery disease was found in seven of the 14 patients in whom infarction had occurred during sleep and in eight of the 10 patients in whom infarction had occurred during wakefulness (p = 0.21). Cerebrovascular occlusive disease was not found in the five patients aged less than 50 years. Our findings suggest that embolism is a common mechanism of retinal infarction during sleep or wakefulness, that in patients aged greater than 50 years extracranial carotid artery disease is a common source of retinal emboli, and that the retina may be especially susceptible to infarction during sleep. 
1	The impact of physician compliance on screening mammography for older women. Screening mammography is underutilized, even for women older than 50 years for whom there is a general consensus that regular annual screening is appropriate and necessary. To evaluate reasons for this underutilization, we studied a random sample of 517 women in Los Angeles, Calif who were older than 50 years. All women were found to be underscreened, especially women older than 65 years. For example, approximately 35% of women 50 to 64 years old and 47% of women aged 65 years and older never had had even one mammogram. Analyses revealed that the most important factor that predicted whether a women ever had had a mammogram was whether her physician had talked to her about mammography. Women were between four and 12 times more likely, depending on their age group, to have had a mammogram at some time if their physicians discussed it with them. The discussions did not need to be lengthy or complex. These results indicate that physicians need to know that discussing screening mammography with their patients has a major impact on breast cancer screening behaviors. 
5	Gastric dysrhythmias following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Possible mechanism for early delayed gastric emptying. Transient delayed gastric emptying is reported as a frequent complication following pancreas-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW). We placed serosal electrodes on the stomach of a patient undergoing PPW. Myoelectric recordings were obtained postoperatively and correlated with simultaneous radionuclide liquid gastric emptying studies. The patient developed early postoperative gastric atony, associated with frequent gastric dysrhythmias. These dysrhythmias may have been exacerbated by a perihepatic abscess. The gastric dysrhythmias correlated with alterations in liquid gastric emptying. Gastric dysrhythmias may be a mechanism for gastric dysfunction in the early postoperative period. 
4	Myocardial sulfhydryl pool alterations occur during reperfusion after brief and prolonged myocardial ischemia in vivo. Myocardial sulfhydryl (SH)-containing compounds, including reduced glutathione (GSH), are both defenses against and potential markers of reactive oxygen metabolite injury during ischemia and reperfusion. We examined the alterations in GSH and other myocardial SH pools during reperfusion in anesthetized dogs exposed to brief (15 minutes, n = 7) or prolonged (90 minutes, n = 6) regional ischemia caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Ninety minutes of ischemia followed by 5 hours of reperfusion, which resulted in myocardial necrosis of 43.9 +/- 4.0% of the area at risk, caused a 22% reduction in total myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 57% decrease in nonprotein myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 56% decrease in GSH (p less than 0.01), and a 62% decrease in non-GSH, nonprotein SH groups (p less than 0.02). However, protein SH groups were not significantly reduced (12% decrease, p = NS). Also, myocardial release of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into the coronary venous effluent occurred during early reperfusion. In contrast, 15 minutes of ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, did not alter myocardial total SH groups, protein SH groups, or GSH (9% decrease, p = NS); nor was there reperfusion release of GSH or GSSG. However, even with brief ischemia, nonprotein SH groups decreased 23% (p less than 0.05), due mainly to a 59% decrease in the non-GSH, nonprotein SH pool (p less than 0.05). These changes after brief ischemia occurred without alterations in myocardial GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio. 
5	Risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. First-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at greater risk for dementia when compared with the relatives of their healthy peers, but not when compared with the relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease. This may indicate that the risk of dementia in these relatives is not specific to AD or that these studies are biased. We obtained a family history and vital status information on each first-degree relative of patients attending a clinic and in a group of recruited healthy elderly subjects. Patients formed two groups: probable AD and other forms of dementia or cognitive disorders without dementia. The odds of dementia in first-degree relatives did not differ between patient groups. The odds of dementia in relatives of patients with probable AD or other forms of dementia was six times that in the relatives of the healthy elderly subjects. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age in the first-degree relatives of all subjects. Approximately 50% of the first-degree relatives of patients with AD were demented by age 91 years, but almost the same number of the other patient group's relatives were demented as well. That figure was never reached in the healthy elderly subject's relatives. Because the risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with AD was similar to that for patients with other disorders, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of selection and information biases. Our investigation implies that the increased risk of dementia may not be specific to relatives of patients with AD; the risk may also be increased in first-degree relatives of patients with other neurologic disorders. 
5	Persistence of chronic constipation in children after biofeedback treatment. We investigated the efficacy of biofeedback treatment and evaluated anorectal factors that might be responsible for persistence of chronic constipation with or without encopresis in a group of 38 children with abnormal contraction of the pelvic floor during straining and persistence of chronic constipation with encopresis after conventional treatment. Nine children were unsuccessful in learning to relax the pelvic floor during straining with biofeedback treatment, and one patient had contraction of the pelvic floor on follow-up despite successful biofeedback treatment; none recovered. Twenty-eight children were able to relax the pelvic floor on follow-up; 14 recovered and 14 did not recover from chronic constipation. Nonrecovered patients who learned to relax the pelvic floor had significantly decreased rectal and anal responsiveness to rectal distension as compared to recovered patients during the initial and follow-up anorectal manometric study. Psychological factors such as social competence and behavior problems did not appear to be responsible for recovery or nonrecovery from chronic constipation and encopresis. 
3	Cognitive strategies during coincident timing tasks. Research findings suggest that experience and cognitive strategies contribute to successful performance during perceptual-motor tasks. This article critically reviews selected literature on the effects of information-processing skills, preferred movement time, experience, and task difficulty on performance during coincident timing tasks. Theoretical information and research findings are discussed, and their applications to clinical practice are considered. Clinical recommendations include assessment of coincident timing skills and use of functional activities that provide opportunities to explore and dynamically interact with the environment. 
1	Successful reinduction therapy with amsacrine and cyclocytidine in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in children. A report from the Childrens Cancer Study Group. Amsacrine (AMSA) and cyclocytidine were studied as retrieval therapy in 122 pediatric patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Patients either failed to achieve sustained initial remissions or were in relapse. Induction therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) AMSA (75 mg/m2) from days 1 to 5 and subcutaneous cyclocytidine (600 mg/m2) from days 1 to 7. Maintenance therapy consisted of IV etoposide (VP-16) (100 mg/m2) for 5 days and IV AMSA (100 mg/m2) on day 1. Of 122 patients, 109 were evaluable. There were 13 early deaths. Ninety-six patients received adequate therapy defined as completion of two courses of therapy. Of these 96 patients, 52 achieved complete remission. Fifteen of 33 patients who failed initial induction achieved complete remission. Eighteen of 39 patients who were resistant to anthracyclines had complete responses. There was no direct evidence of AMSA-induced cardiotoxicity. Remission duration was 28 days to 3 or more years (median, 98 days). AMSA and cyclocytidine were effective retrieval therapy for patients who were in relapse or unresponsive to frontline therapy. Duration of remission was short (median, 98 days). 
1	Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. V. 8-Mercaptoguanosine as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation. Guanine ribonucleosides, substituted at the C8 position with either a bromine or a thiol group, have recently been shown to regulate several immunologic responses. We have previously shown that 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MG) can replace the requirement for cytokines in the generation of MHC-restricted CTL. In this paper, we examined the ability of 8MG to induce MHC-nonrestricted killer cells. We found that 8MG did not induce significant lytic activity from normal resting lymphocytes. However, 8MG was able to synergize with minimal amounts of IL-2 in inducing lytic activity similar to lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) in that both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cells were killed. Both the precursors and effectors of 8MG-LAK activity were similar to NK cells and were CD4- CD8- asialo-GM1+ NK1.1+. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK, 8MG-LAK were B220+. 8MG appeared to "stage" these precursor lymphocytes to become more responsive to IL-2 because optimal induction of 8MG-LAK required preincubation with 8MG before the addition of IL-2. This "staging" appeared to be due to the release of a "second signal" since it was readily inhibited by cyclosporine A. Anti-IFN-alpha beta was as efficient as cyclosporine A in inhibiting 8MG-LAK generation, whereas anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-1 did not exhibit significant inhibition. These findings suggest that 8MG can be of possible utility as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation from NK cells. 
3	Effects of dietary calcium on nimodipine-sensitive calcium channel function in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure, survival, and calcium channel function to investigate cardiovascular disease mechanisms in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Beginning at 3 weeks of age, rats were fed high sodium chloride diets (8.0%) in combination with either high (2.0%) or low (0.2%) Ca2+ diets for 8 weeks. At 12 weeks of age, survival was 90% in the high Ca2+ group and 30% in the low Ca2+ group. The higher blood pressure and lower survival in the low Ca2+ group suggest an intensification of altered vascular muscle cell mechanisms by a dietary Ca2+ deficit. Nimodipine (1-10 nM) effectively blocked L-type Ca2+ currents in isolated vascular muscle cells from both groups. Contraction of isolated cells that were not patch clamped to high potassium solutions were also blocked by 1 nM nimodipine. Disappearance of the L-type Ca2+ channel current was accelerated by holding at depolarizing potentials (positive to -50 mV) and by depolarizing steps to 0 mV. Nimodipine block of the L-type Ca2+ currents in vascular muscle is believed to contribute substantially to antihypertensive properties and stroke prevention, actions that may develop fully only in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats on a diet of at least normal Ca2+. 
5	Respiratory distress in a child in the office. We have reviewed respiratory distress from a pathophysiologic approach. Two specific disease entities, epiglottitis and asthma, which commonly present with respiratory distress, are reviewed. The office management of respiratory distress encompasses early recognition of disease to prevent symptoms from progressing. Referral should be considered in any difficult cases. 
4	Effects of renin inhibition in systemic hypertension. The effect of the direct renin inhibitor enalkiren (Abbott Laboratories) was examined in 8 healthy patients with essential hypertension. With an unrestricted sodium diet, plasma renin concentration was inhibited within 10 minutes by intravenous enalkiren and remained essentially undetectable for greater than or equal to 6 hours (11.9 +/- 4 to 1.0 +/- 0.6 ng angiotensin I/ml/hour, p less than 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure declined gradually (108 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.02), as did plasma aldosterone concentration (14.4 +/- 3.8 to 4.4 +/- 0.8 ng/dl, p = 0.03), whereas plasma immunoreactive active renin concentration increased progressively (35 +/- 14 to 160 +/- 60 pg/ml, p greater than 0.05). Urinary excretion of the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) decreased slightly, but not significantly (42 +/- 10 to 33 +/- 11 ng/g creatinine, p = 0.13). The addition of a diuretic decreased baseline blood pressure and increased baseline plasma renin and aldosterone values. Blood pressure responses to enalkiren were slightly (though not significantly) greater than those observed before diuretic administration. We conclude that enalkiren is effective in decreasing blood pressure and in inhibiting the renin system, without significantly altering urinary prostacyclin excretion, in patients with essential hypertension. These results suggest that the renin system contributes to the maintenance of elevated blood pressure in some patients with essential hypertension. 
5	New biological properties of pyrroloquinoline quinone and its related compounds: inhibition of chemiluminescence, lipid peroxidation and rat paw edema. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) inhibited the chemiluminescence (CL) from mouse peritoneal cells initiated by zymosan, carrageenin and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and CL generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction and the lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate. The inhibitory activity of PQQ was more potent than that of idebenone, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in all the three assay systems. In the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction, PQQ had no effect on the formation of uric acid at the concentration of CL inhibition. These results suggest that PQQ might have a radical scavenger-like activity. Structure-activity relationship of PQQ and its six related compounds showed that the 7- and 9-carboxyl groups of PQQ as well as the orthoquinone structure are responsible for the radical scavenger-like activity. In addition, the -NH group in the pyrrole ring of PQQ seemed to be essential for the antilipid peroxidative activity in the rat brain homogenate. When administered i.p., PQQ inhibited the development of 0.1% carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats. These results suggest that PQQ might have therapeutic effects on various diseases, of which development or exacerbation has been known to be associated with radical oxygens. 
2	Pancreatic pseudocysts. When to drain, when to wait. Acute pain in the upper abdomen in a patient recovering from pancreatitis or abdominal trauma may herald a pancreatic pseudocyst. Although small cysts resolve spontaneously, those larger than 6 cm across usually require treatment to prevent such complications as rupture into adjacent structures and infection. The authors describe operative and nonoperative treatment methods and the success reported with each. 
2	Evaluation of the magnitude of gastro-oesophageal reflux in Barrett's oesophagus. A manometric study to determine the role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in Barrett's oesophagus was performed on 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus and 53 patients with reflux oesophagitis without Barrett's oesophagus (25 with mild oesophagitis and 28 with severe oesophagitis). For the same reason, the 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus also underwent 24 hour continuous oesophageal pH monitoring, and the results obtained were compared with those of 20 oesophagitis patients without Barrett's oesophagus (10 with mild oesophagitis and 10 with severe oesophagitis). The manometric results show that the motor changes found in the Barrett's group are specific but similar to the motor dysfunction associated with reflux oesophagitis. Motor anomalies are probably related more to the inflammatory process in the oesophageal wall than to the metaplastic changes themselves. The pH monitoring results show that while reflux in the Barrett's oesophagus patients was greater overall than in the oesophagitis group without Barrett's oesophagus, the changes are similar when the results are compared with the severe oesophagitis group. In conclusion there are other factors besides gastro-oesophageal reflux involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus. 
4	Comparison of epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in Prinzmetal's variant angina and chronic stable angina pectoris It has been suggested that a generalized coronary vasomotion disorder is present in variant angina and that evaluation of baseline coronary artery tone may be useful for predicting the occurrence of coronary artery spasm. The vasomotor response of angiographically normal proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in 9 patients with atypical chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (control group), 13 patients with active variant angina and 41 patients with chronic stable angina. Ergonovine (intravenous, 100 to 300 micrograms, or intracoronary, 8 to 20 micrograms, was administered to all 22 patients in the control and variant angina groups and to 11 of the 41 patients with chronic stable angina. All patients also received intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (1 to 2 mg). Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement of angiographically normal segments was carried out before and after ergonovine and nitrate administration. Mean baseline intraluminal diameter of proximal and distal coronary segments was not significantly different in control patients and those with variant angina (nonspastic segments only) or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.89 +/- 0.15, 2.83 +/- 0.14 and 2.82 +/- 0.09 mm; distal 1.60 +/- 0.08, 1.63 +/- 0.07 and 1.62 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). After ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 15 +/- 3% and 11 +/- 4% and distal segments by 11 +/- 3%, 11 +/- 2% and 14 +/- 3% in control, variant angina and coronary artery disease groups, respectively (p = NS). 
1	Intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas: Leuchtenberger bodies revisited. The presence of intraepithelial inclusion bodies (Leuchtenberger bodies) was recorded in rectal or colonic specimens from 130 patients. Large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies were recorded in 81.8 percent of 55 colorectal adenomas from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Conversely, none of the 55 non-FAP adenomas or of the 20 specimens with ulcerative colitis (10 with dysplasia) had similar amounts of intraepithelial granules. Feulgen studies demonstrated that the granules contain DNA and are probably nuclear fragments of destroyed lymphocytes. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains obscure, it appears that the presence of large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas should strongly raise the suspicion of FAP. 
2	Propofol as an i.v. anaesthetic induction agent in variegate porphyria. The choice of an i.v. anaesthetic induction poses problems for the anaesthetist confronted with a patient with one of the acute porphyrias. We undertook a prospective clinical trial in 13 variegate porphyric subjects using propofol as an anaesthetic induction agent. Urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins were measured before operation and 1-5 days after operation. Stool and plasma porphyrin concentrations were measured over the same period. Comparison of these data in the porphyric patients and in 21 control subjects over the trial period revealed no significant change in porphyrin or porphyrin precursor output after operation. Urinary porphyrin precursor concentrations did not exceed the limits established for variegate porphyric patients in remission, and there were no changes in the stool and plasma porphyrin profiles or any symptoms of an acute porphyric attack. We conclude that propofol did not appear to be porphyrinogenic when used for the induction of anaesthesia in 13 patients with variegate porphyria. 
5	Long-term followup of asymptomatic microhematuria. We present a 10 to 20-year followup assessment of 191 patients with unexplained microhematuria (including persons with insignificant lesions). Genitourinary malignancies did not develop in any of the patients (128 alive and 27 dead) evaluated after the first diagnostic investigation. Patient and physician compliance with followup protocols was poor. We currently recommend renal ultrasound and cystoscopy for the first diagnostic survey, have abandoned routine periodic studies and advise diagnostic studies only for patients in whom symptoms develop. 
1	Primary undifferentiated small cell carcinoma of the esophagus: clinicopathological and flow cytometric evaluation of eight cases. We present a clinicopathological and flow cytometric evaluation of eight primary small cell carcinomas of the esophagus representing 1.5% of all esophageal malignancies diagnosed during a 22-year period (1965-1987) in the Tampere University Central Hospital. The mean age of the patients (four male and four female) was 67 years (range 55-75 years). Five cases had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Three patients were treated by esophageal resection, one by laser vaporisation, and four by chemotherapy. The median survival time was 4 months (range 9 days to 8 months). A complete local response to chemotherapy in serial esophagogramms was detected in one patient. All four patients given chemotherapy survived longer than those treated with esophageal resection only. Four (67%) of the six carcinomas analyzed by DNA flow cytometry contained DNA-aneuploid stemlines. The median S-phase fraction of these small cell carcinomas was high (16.3%), reflecting rapid cell proliferation rate, which may be related to their responsiveness to chemotherapy. 
4	Choice of drug treatment for elderly hypertensive patients. It is generally agreed that moderate and severe hypertension in the elderly should be treated, but it is not clear which drug or drugs are most appropriate. Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective, but they are associated with metabolic side effects that are becoming less acceptable as newer agents become available. Beta blockers are effective, but can be associated with central nervous system side effects and are often contraindicated by coexisting disease. Recently, attention has been focused on the newer agents, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The advantage of calcium antagonists is that they do not produce metabolic side effects. However, they are expensive and may cause vasodilatory side effects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective and relatively free of side effects and may be particularly useful for elderly hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure. 
5	Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report. We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures). The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis. The tumor and the hematoma were removed. The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given. Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint. 
5	Maternal predictors of fetal demise in trauma during pregnancy. Trauma complicates 6 to 7 per cent of all pregnancies, but fetal demise secondary to maternal trauma occurs much less frequently. This study was done to analyze the incidence of fetal demise as a function of 21 maternal characteristics determined within the first 24 hours after trauma. Nine instances of fetal demise were identified from 73 pregnant patients with trauma admitted to four Level I trauma centers from a combined data base of 30,000 patients. Maternal factors examined by logistic regression were Injury Severity Score (ISS), Trauma Score (TS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), fluid requirements in the initial 24 hours, systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), hemoglobin, hematocrit and arterial blood gas analysis. Fetal demise was found to be associated with increasing ISS, increasing face and abdominal AIS, increasing fluid requirements, maternal acidosis and maternal hypoxia. Standard maternal laboratory and physiologic parameters, such as hemoglobin and hematocrit, oxygen and hemoglobin saturation, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, SBP and HR were not predictive. The TS was also found to be nonpredictive. 
1	Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. 
4	Balloon rupture due to lesion morphology during coronary angioplasty. We report a case of coronary angioplasty of a left anterior descending artery lesion that was complicated by the rupture of three successive balloon catheters. Each rupture occurred as a pinhole jet of contrast into a diagonal side branch, causing subintimal staining. This case demonstrates that balloon rupture may result from lesion morphology. 
5	The efficacy of palliative and definitive percutaneous versus surgical drainage of pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts: a prospective study of 85 patients. We compared the efficacy of percutaneous to surgical drainage in a prospective study in 85 patients with pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts. Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic abscesses in 18 patients cured three and palliated 12 who were eventually cured by elective surgical ablation; three patients died. This compares well to our 15 surgical patients, of whom four were cured by surgery alone and six were palliated. All were subsequently cured by additional computerized tomography-guided or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and medical management or surgery. Five of the 15 died. Percutaneous drainage cured 11 of 14 infected pseudocysts and palliated two, which were subsequently cured by surgery; one was palliated but the patient was lost to follow-up. Surgical drainage cured six of 12 infected pseudocysts and palliated the other six, of which four were cured by further surgery and the other two were cured by secondary percutaneous drainage. Nine of 12 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by percutaneous aspiration, and two were palliated and later cured. In one patient, disease progressed, and he was ultimately lost to follow-up. Thirteen of 14 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by surgical drainage. The other patient died of pulmonary embolus. In patients treated by percutaneous techniques, there were four major complications. Our study established distinct advantages of percutaneous drainage under computerized tomographic and ultrasonic guidance: (1) the procedures can be carried out under ultrasonic guidance in an intensive care unit on critically ill patients, (2) the technique proved highly effective for initial palliation, with defervescence and stabilization occurring in most critically ill patients within 48 hours, (3) findings from fine needle aspiration provided valuable information as to microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivities and differed in 29 of 85 patients from those of concomitant blood cultures, and (4) definitive eradication of the process (surgical ablation of residual necrotic material) can be elected after the patient's clinical condition stabilizes. 
1	The neuroradiology of visual disturbances. The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma. High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body. The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved. MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk. The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient. 
4	Maternal and fetal effects of labetalol in pregnant ewes. Labetalol has been advocated to rapidly decrease blood pressure in preeclamptic women and to blunt the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. To assess labetalol's actions in a setting of uterine vasoconstriction, saline or labetalol (1 mg/kg) was infused into maternal venous catheters in 12 pregnant ewes receiving continuous maternal intravenous infusions of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 120 +/- 4% of control and decreased uterine blood flow to 45 +/- 6% of control. Labetalol, but not saline, altered these parameters: it decreased MAP to 101 +/- 3% and increased uterine blood flow to 70 +/- 7% of prenorepinephrine values. In the second protocol, to assess the degree of labetalol-induced fetal adrenergic blockade, 7 pregnant ewes received, on separate days, saline or labetalol (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) via a maternal venous catheter. Maternally administered labetalol produced minor (less than 12%) decreases in maternal and fetal MAP, without significantly altering heart rate (HR). At each labetalol dose, the degree of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, determined by phenylephrine and isoproterenol challenge, was greater in the ewe than in the fetus. In the near-term pregnant ewe, intravenous (iv) bolus administration of labetalol ameliorated the effects of increased circulating norepinephrine on maternal MAP, uterine blood flow, and fetal pH and arterial O2 tension (PaO2), and produced less adrenergic blockade in the fetus than in the mother. 
5	Aminocaproic acid prophylaxis in traumatic hyphema. Oral aminocaproic acid has been shown to be effective in clot stabilization and in the reduction of secondary bleeding rates in cases of traumatic hyphema. In a retrospective study of 105 patients treated during a 1-year period, we found the incidence of rebleeding in patients with traumatic hyphema who received aminocaproic acid prophylaxis was 2%; the incidence in those who did not was 25%. 
5	Chronic posterior subluxation and dislocation of the radial head. The clinical and radiographic features of chronic posterior subluxation or dislocation of the radial head were studied in thirty-four elbows of twenty-seven patients. Three characteristic radiographic types were noted: Type I, subluxation; Type II, posterior dislocation with minimum displacement; and Type III, posterior dislocation with substantial proximal migration of the radius. Follow-up of eighteen patients (twenty-one elbows) revealed that posterior displacement did not usually cause serious functional impairment except for loss of rotation of the forearm. The least common presentation, Type-I subluxation, caused pain and clicking and was associated with late degenerative arthritis. Cosmetic deformity due to prominence of the radial head was also a cosmetic problem, particularly with Type-III dislocation. 
3	Surgical treatment of a rare congenital anomaly of the vertebral artery: case report and review of the literature. A case of an abnormal loop of the vertebral artery compressing both the cervicomedullary junction and the accessory nerve is reported. The embryological development of the vertebrobasilar system may explain this anatomical anomaly. The possibility of an abnormal location of the vertebral artery may complicate the lateral C1-C2 puncture for myelography. Only five similar cases have been reported previously, but none of them presented any clinical symptomatology, and surgical treatment was never required. The present patient was cured by microvascular decompression. The pathogenetic and surgical implications are discussed in light of the literature. 
1	Concurrent cisplatin, infusional fluorouracil, and conventionally fractionated radiation therapy in head and neck cancer: dose-limiting mucosal toxicity. After a preliminary dose-finding study involving 12 patients with advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer, 27 patients were treated on a phase II protocol, using fluorouracil 350 mg/m2/d by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days, followed on the sixth day by a 2-hour IV infusion of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, administered during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy to total doses between 60 and 64 Gy, using 2 Gy daily fractions. Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease. Four had recurrent disease after surgery. Three-year follow-up is now available. Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years. Four have developed systemic metastases. Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%. Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime. Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases. No late sequelae have so far been recorded. It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional "cures" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients. The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic. 
1	Characterization of liver-associated natural killer cells in patients with liver tumors. The existence of a marginal lymphocyte population in rat liver sinusoids has already been demonstrated using the sinusoidal lavage method. We used the same technique to study the lymphocyte population in human liver obtained ex vivo after partial hepatectomy for benign or malignant tumors and compared it with peripheral and portal blood lymphocyte populations. Percentages of lymphocyte surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry. The lymphocyte population obtained from human liver is mainly made up of CD56+ (35%) cells. This percentage is three times greater than that found in peripheral and portal blood. Two-color flow cytometry analysis showed that within the CD56+ liver cell population, at least three distinct subsets could be found: (a) CD3+/CD56+/CD16-; (b) CD3-/CD56+/CD16-; and (c) CD3-/CD56+/CD16+. Although these subsets were also present in peripheral and portal blood, the percentage distribution was completely different because most CD56+ cells in peripheral and portal blood belonged to the CD3-/CD56+/CD16+ subset. These results show the existence of a heterogeneous natural killer cell population in human livers with tumors. The functional significance of this heterogeneity still needs to be explained. 
5	Local hypothermia to prolong safe tourniquet time. Local hypothermia was studied as a method to safely prolong tourniquet time for reconstructive procedures of the upper extremity. An ice blanket constructed of flannel cloth and cold gel packs was applied to the limb for 45 minutes preoperatively. Seventy-eight patients were evaluated for complications resulting from hypothermia and prolonged tourniquet application. The duration of continuous tourniquet ischemia averaged two hours and 25 minutes. Intraoperative muscle temperature recordings indicated that the iced limbs were an average of 12.9 degrees cooler than noniced limbs before tourniquet inflation. Electron microscopic studies of biopsied muscle showed no evidence of ischemic changes. There were no postoperative complications associated with prolonged tourniquet inflation or the hypothermia blanket technique. Local hypothermia appears to be a safe and effective method of decreasing the adverse effects of tourniquet ischemia and allowing continuous tourniquet inflation time to extend safely beyond the customary two-hour limit. 
3	Central nervous system tuberculosis in children: a review of 30 cases. The medical records of 30 children with central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS tuberculosis) who were treated between March, 1976, and February, 1989, were reviewed. All had cranial computerized tomography scans at presentation. The mean cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count was 200/mm3, protein 239 mg/dl, glucose 25 mg/dl and CSF/serum glucose ratio 21%. Mantoux skin tests with 5 tuberculin units were greater than or equal to 10 mm induration in 50%, and chest radiographs were positive in 40% of patients. Hydrocephalus was demonstrated by cranial computerized tomography in all 30 patients (100%). Cranial computerized tomography scan demonstrating hydrocephalus is a sensitive radiographic nervous system tuberculosis and should be part of the early evaluation of children with suspected central nervous system tuberculosis. 
1	Pseudocyst of the auricle. Case report and world literature review We treated a patient with pseudocyst of the auricle and reviewed the 113 cases previously published in the world literature. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that involves the anthelix of the ear, results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity, and occurs predominantly in men (93% of patients). Characteristically, only one ear is involved (87% of patients), and the lesion is usually located within the scaphoid or triangular fossa of the anthelix. Previous trauma to the involved ear is uncommon. The diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical features, and analysis of the aspirated cystic fluid and/or histologic examination of a lesional biopsy specimen will confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic intervention that maintains the architecture of the patient's external ear should be used in the treatment of this benign condition. 
1	Prognostic factors for survival of patients with advanced urothelial tumors treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy. Between February 1983 and February 1986, 132 patients with advanced urothelial tract tumors were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy. Analysis of prognostic factors for survival of the first 92 patients was undertaken using the Cox proportional hazards model. Normal alkaline phosphatase and high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were predominant for long survival. Patients 60 years or older at initiation of therapy were likely to survive longer than younger patients, perhaps indicating physician selectivity of older patients for this therapy, and those with initial hemoglobin in the normal range were also likely to survive longer. The additional 40 patients' data were used to validate the model. Clinical implications of the prognostic factors are discussed. 
3	Movement disorders--limb movement and the basal ganglia. The primary concern of this article is to review experimental methods that may lead to a better understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement. Two models of basal ganglia impairment are considered: Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The review focuses primarily on akinesia and bradykinesia because they are key abnormalities of basal ganglia dysfunction. In general, through electromyography and kinematic analysis of movement, it may be possible to characterize specific movement disorders. Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement. Much of the data reviewed suggests that the basal ganglia may play a specific role in the initiation and regulation of force control. 
5	Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in urinary diversion with urea-splitting urinary tract infection. We present two cases of hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to urea-splitting urinary tract infection with urinary diversion. One patient had a ureterosigmoidostomy, the other an ileal loop diversion. Neither patient had significant underlying liver disease, but both had considerable muscle atrophy that may have predisposed them to develop hyperammonemia. Medical therapy did not provide long-term control of symptoms. In both cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy resolved after revision of their urinary diversions. The probable mechanism of the metabolic derangements produced by urea-splitting urinary tract infections is reviewed. We suggest that patients with urinary diversion who develop hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to a urea-splitting urinary tract infection be treated with surgical revision of the urinary system to improve drainage and decrease bowel contact time. 
3	Postischemic (S)-emopamil therapy ameliorates focal ischemic brain injury in rats. (S)-Emopamil is a calcium channel blocker of the phenylalkylamine class, having potent serotonin S2 antagonistic properties and high blood-brain barrier penetrability. Previous studies have documented cerebroprotective effect in animal models of both focal and global ischemia. The present study was undertaken to define the postischemic "window" of therapeutic efficacy for this agent. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion, combined with an initial 30-minute period of halothane-induced hypotension (50 mm Hg). (S)-Emopamil (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally either 20-30 minutes prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion or 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours following occlusion. Treated groups received a second similar dose 2.5 hours later and twice daily for 2 days thereafter. Brains were perfusion-fixed on the third day. Planimetric analysis of hemotoxylin and eosin-stained coronal brain sections documented a cortical infarct averaging 72.9 +/- 33.3 mm3 (mean +/- SD) in untreated rats. Cortical infarct volume was reduced by 48% (to 37.6 +/- 27.6 mm3) when therapy was initiated 1 hour postischemia (p less than 0.05). When treatment was deferred to 2 hours postichemia, mean cortical infarct volume was reduced by 34%, but this difference did not attain statistical significance. Infarct volume in rats with treatment initiated at 3 hours postischemia was indistinguishable from that in controls. Striatal infarct volume was similar in all groups. These results document a postischemic therapeutic window of cerebroprotection for (S)-emopamil lying between 1 and 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. 
3	Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. 
4	Occult vascular malformations of the optic chiasm: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and surgical laser resection. Angiographically occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm are extremely rare. Before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was difficult to diagnose these lesions preoperatively. We report MRI scan findings of optic chiasm cavernous angiomas in two patients with chiasmal syndrome. MRI was useful in localizing the vascular malformation and delineating its characteristics, especially chronic hemorrhage. One patient underwent biopsy of the lesion. The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized. The MRI scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and following these lesions. In certain patients, these vascular malformations may be amenable to complete surgical removal with stabilization or improvement of visual function. 
5	Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly persons [clinical conference] We have seen that UGI bleeding is a serious and apparently growing problem for seniors. Of special concern in the older patient are the frequency with which serious peptic disease presents silently, the limitation frequently imposed on adequate pain relief from NSAIDs, and the higher complication rates from most of the causes of UGI bleeding. Care of the elderly would be enhanced by research focused on defining those older patients most at risk of experiencing NSAID-induced peptic complications, improved methods for preventing or treating NSAID-induced ulceration that are well tolerated and cost-effective, and better regimens for preventing the recurrence of ulcers and UGI bleeding in these patients. In regard to the last, future investigation of the role of H. pylori, methods for successfully eliminating the organism, and the effect of eradication on patients' subsequent course may be particularly helpful. 
1	Cyclic-AMP binding proteins in the head and neck. Results are presented of a preliminary study in which cAMP binding activity was measured in 34 specimens from a variety of head and neck sites. A wide range of cAMP binding protein levels was detected in all tissues assessed. There appeared to be a subgroup of parotid adenomas with increased cAMP binding activity. The biological significance of these proteins remains to be determined and their relationship to tumour growth in the head and neck is likely to be complex. 
5	Metastatic small cell tumor of bone with 'true' rosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity. A 15-year-old black girl was admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with a lytic lesion involving the right fourth metacarpal bone with a solitary metastasis to the ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Histologic examination of both the primary lesion and metastasis revealed a primitive small round cell lesion. Abundant rosettes with central lumina were present in the metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the metastasis were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, and Leu-7. Electron microscopic examination of the metastasis revealed lumen formation with apical microvilli and juxtaluminal junctional complexes. This tumor exhibits features that are suggestive, but not definitive, of primitive ependymal differentiation and further expands the morphologic and immunophenotypic range of small round cell tumors of bone. 
3	Total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis. A comparison of the polycentric and total condylar prostheses. From 1971 to 1985, 393 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed in patients for rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, 112 used polycentric prostheses and 131 used total condylar prostheses. One hundred seven of the patients with polycentric prostheses and 102 of the patients with total condylar prostheses were followed for a minimum of two years (average, 61 and 55 months, respectively). At the time of the latest examination, nine knees with polycentric prostheses required revision surgery: six for tibial component loosening and instability and three for patellofemoral pain. Five knees with total condylar prostheses required revision: one for chronic instability, one for a late posttraumatic patellar fracture, and three for late hematogenous infections. The total condylar prostheses with patellar resurfacing had better scores for pain (8.5 points) than the polycentric prosthesis without patellofemoral resurfacing (7.0 points). The total condylar prosthesis appeared more durable in terms of fixation, with no evidence of aseptic loosening of femoral or tibial components noted in this series thus far. 
1	Effect of hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on adenine and pyridine nucleotide pools in human peripheral lymphocytes. Hyperthermia has been shown in vitro and in vivo to potentiate the effects of ionizing irradiation. Previous studies found that hyperthermia alters the metabolism of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymers required for recovery from DNA damage and that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is very sensitive to cellular nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels. Thus, the effect of 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on NAD and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels was studied in human peripheral lymphocytes. In vitro studies showed significant decreases in oxidized NAD (NAD+) and ATP levels after heating that simulated a clinical whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) treatment. This nucleotide depletion could not be attributed to nucleotide leakage or increased enzymatic NAD+ consumption. As the reduction of NAD observed was sufficient to decrease poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity by 50%, the studies were extended to clinica cases. Cellular NAD+ and ATP were measured in previously stored lymphocytes obtained from four patients before and after WBH; a statistically significant decrease in NAD+ was observed after WBH which quantitatively agreed with the in vitro results. Based on these results a prospective study was done in three patients; NAD+ was extracted immediately on sample collection, and the kinetics of WBH-induced NAD depletion were studied. These data, which agree quantitatively with the laboratory results, are presented. 
5	National General Practice Study of Epilepsy: recurrence after a first seizure In the National General Practice Study of Epilepsy 564 patients classified as having definite seizures have been followed up for 2-4 years. 67% (95% confidence interval 63-71%) had a recurrence within 12 months of the first seizure, and 78% (74-81%) had a recurrence within 36 months. Seizures associated with a neurological deficit presumed present at birth had a high rate of recurrence (100% by 12 months), whereas seizures that occurred within 3 months of an acute insult to the brain, such as head injury or stroke, or in the context of an acute precipitant such as alcohol, carried a much lower risk of recurrence (40% [29-51%] by 12 months). Other factors affecting the risk of recurrence were age-the highest risk being for patients under the age of 16 (83% [77-89%] by 36 months) or over the age of 59 (83% [76-90%] by 36 months-and type of first seizure-the risk of recurrence being much higher for patients with simple partial or complex partial seizures (94% [90-99%] by 36 months) than for those with generalised tonic clonic seizures (72% [67-77%] by 36 months). 
4	Ventricular tachycardia and accelerated ventricular rhythm presenting in the first month of life. Fourteen infants aged less than 1 month presented to our institution during the last 22 years with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or accelerated ventricular rhythm and a structurally normal heart. In 2, VT was associated with long QT syndrome. Both are alive on beta-blocker therapy, 1 with an implanted pacemaker. Twelve infants had accelerated ventricular rhythm, and 2 of these died in the first 2 months of life of unrelated conditions. The other 10 are alive at a median age of 4 years (range 2 months to 11 years), and none were lost to follow-up. Hemodynamic compromise did not occur with accelerated ventricular rhythm. The ventricular rate was very close to the sinus rate in all 12, less than 12% above the sinus rate. The mean QRS duration during accelerated ventricular rhythm was 92.5 ms, and averaged twice the QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Fusion beats were seen in all 12, and there was atrioventricular dissociation with capture beats in 10. In 2, ventriculoatrial conduction was present. Treatment was attempted in 5 of the 10 survivors with accelerated ventricular rhythm, and was thought to be successful in 4. Treatment was later successfully withdrawn in all 5, so that all 10 survivors were free of accelerated ventricular rhythm and were not receiving antiarrhythmic medications at last follow-up. Because of the excellent long-term outcome and the lack of hemodynamic compromise during the rhythm, it seems reasonable to withhold antiarrhythmic therapy in infants with accelerated ventricular rhythm and await resolution of the rhythm. 
4	Enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improves cardiac function in hypoxic rabbit ventricle without increasing total glycolytic flux. The effects of elevated glucose on cardiac function during hypoxia were investigated in isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa. Rest tension, developed tension, intracellular potential, 42K+ efflux, lactate production, exogenous glucose utilization, and tissue high-energy phosphate levels were measured during a 50-min period of hypoxia with 4, 5, or 50 mM glucose present (isosmotically balanced with sucrose) and during reoxygenation for 60 min with perfusate containing 5 mM glucose/45 mM sucrose. At physiologic (4 or 5 mM) and supraphysiologic glucose (50 mM), lactate production and high-energy phosphate levels during hypoxia were equally well maintained, yet cardiac dysfunction was markedly attenuated by 50 mM glucose. Despite identical rates of total glycolytic flux, exogenous glucose utilization was enhanced by 50 mM glucose so that tissue glycogen levels remained normal during hypoxia, whereas glycogen became depleted with 4 or 5 mM glucose present during hypoxia. Most of the beneficial effects of 50 mM glucose occurred during the first 25 min of hypoxia. Prior glycogen depletion had no deleterious effects during hypoxia with 50 mM glucose present, but exacerbated cardiac dysfunction during hypoxia with 5 mM glucose present. These findings indicate that enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improved cardiac function during hypoxia without increasing total glycolytic flux or tissue high-energy phosphate levels, suggesting a novel cardioprotective mechanism. 
2	Successful liver transplantation in a patient with a thrombosed portomesenteric system after multiple failed shunts. Combined portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis preventing restoration of adequate portal venous flow has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. We report a patient with failed splenorenal (SR), portocaval (PC), and mesocaval (MC) shunts, who despite the absence of any obvious means for supplying portal venous inflow to a hepatic graft, successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A method of reconstruction of the portal vein with the use of vein grafts anastomosed to a large splanchnic venous collateral is described. This technique can be used in selected patients in whom orthotopic liver transplantation might otherwise be considered technically impossible. 
1	The importance of calcium regulation in toxic cell injury. Studies utilizing the technology of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy. The regulation of ions within the cell is of critical importance in both acute and chronic toxicology. Recently, new methods have been developed for measuring such changes in living cells and correlating them with studies of structure, function, and biochemistry. A major revolution has occurred from the linkage between the computer and the light microscope, which has resulted in the use of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy and video intensification microscopy coupled with image analysis. These methods have already yielded much additional information and it is anticipated that their further application by pathologists and toxicologists will continue to uncover the important role of ion deregulation and toxic cell injury. 
5	Mistaken diagnoses in continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin. The syndrome of continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin has manifestations that resemble those of many other more common neurologic disorders during childhood and infancy. This similarity often leads to misdiagnosis when an adequate index of suspicion is not entertained and a comprehensive electromyographic examination is not performed. Two affected patients from 1 family are reported to illustrate the type of diagnostic errors that were made before the establishment of the correct diagnosis. 
5	Studies on autoimmunity for initiation of beta-cell destruction. VI. Macrophages essential for development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors and insulitis in NOD mice. NOD mice were treated with silica (which is selectively toxic to macrophages) from 4 or 20.5 wk of age. Syngeneic neonatal pancreases were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the NOD mice at 21 wk of age. Silica treatment was continued until 24 wk of age, and then the mice were killed for examination of islet morphology. Neither the islets in transplanted pancreases nor the host pancreatic islets from the early long-term silica-treated animals revealed insulitis. In contrast, most of the islets in transplanted pancreases from the late short-term silica-treated animals showed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis, as did the host islets. A further experiment was performed to compare the effect of late short-term silica treatment with that of anti-L3T4-antibody treatment of the same time and duration. In contrast to the late short-term silica-treated animals, the transplanted pancreases in the anti-L3T4-antibody-treated animals revealed intact islets, although most of the host islets showed insulitis. The control group, which received no treatment but did receive neonatal pancreases, revealed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis of both transplanted and host islets. These results suggest that early macrophage depletion can abolish the development of beta-cell-specific immunologic effectors but that late macrophage depletion, after the development of insulitis, does not affect the destruction of beta-cells by preexisting effectors other than macrophages. We conclude that macrophages are essential for the development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors in the initial phase of insulitis in NOD mice. 
3	Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with improvement. Of 52 patients fulfilling the criteria of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 20 (38%) did not improve after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, two (4%) had a short-lasting improvement and subsequent infusions had no effect, nine (17%) reached a spontaneously or therapeutically induced complete remission, and 21 patients (40%) needed intermittent infusions to maintain improvement. All patients who improved initially had symptoms that significantly interfered with life-style. After treatment, 90% of these patients were independent in their daily activities. Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve. The probability of improvement if all these features are present in 93%. 
4	Panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular problems: results from a community survey. Follow-up studies of psychiatric patients with panic disorder have shown an abnormally high mortality rate in men due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The authors report that in the New Haven portion of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area program the risk for stroke in persons with lifetime diagnoses of panic disorder was over twice that in persons with other psychiatric disorders or no psychiatric disorder. After adjustments for demographic differences between groups, the risk was even higher. While the results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample and absence of medical examinations, these findings are consistent with clinical studies showing an association between panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. 
4	Diagnosing pulmonary embolism: new facts and strategies PURPOSE: To provide a clinical approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 1990) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: In addition to several reviews, studies that evaluated the diagnostic technology of pulmonary embolism were selected. Preference was given to studies with a prospective design, particularly those done within the past decade. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were assessed independently by three unblinded observers. Data were chosen to describe the efficacy of diagnostic technology on the basis of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, and predictive value. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: A normal lung scan or pulmonary angiogram rules out the diagnosis of clinically important pulmonary embolism with at least 95% certainty. Lung scan interpretations indicating high or low probability have approximately a 15% error in diagnosing or ruling out pulmonary embolism. The accuracy of either scan result improves when the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism matches the lung scan result. Serial impedance plethysmography of the lower extremities may exclude thromboembolism with 95% certainty in patients without high-probability lung scan results or cardiopulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clinical suspicion and the results of the lung scan and impedance plethysmography appear to offer acceptable diagnostic accuracy in evaluating many patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The usefulness of this approach for patients with cardiopulmonary disease is still unknown. 
4	Oral contraceptives in women with diabetes. We evaluated the association of oral contraceptive use with the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and glycosylated hemoglobin in women of childbearing age who have diabetes. Neither current or past use nor number of years of use of oral contraceptives was associated with severity of retinopathy, hypertension, or current glycosylated hemoglobin. In conclusion, further study of various birth control methods in young women of childbearing age should be considered. 
4	Is banding of the pulmonary trunk obsolete for infants with tricuspid atresia and double inlet ventricle with a discordant ventriculoarterial connection? Role of aortic arch obstruction and subaortic stenosis Banding the pulmonary trunk may exacerbate or promote the development of subaortic stenosis in patients with double inlet ventricle or tricuspid atresia with a dominant left ventricle and discordant ventriculoarterial connection and, therefore, may be an inappropriate palliative procedure for such patients. To examine this possibility, 102 consecutive infants were studied who presented with this anatomy between 1972 and 1987. Obstruction of the aortic arch was present in 52 patients. In 28 patients (17 with aortic arch obstruction), subaortic stenosis was already apparent at presentation. Of the remaining 74 patients, 19 received no palliative surgery and 55 underwent banding of the pulmonary trunk either with (n = 22) or without (n = 33) aortic arch repair. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with associated aortic arch obstruction. All such patients either died or developed subaortic stenosis by 3 years of age (survival free of subaortic stenosis 0 of 22 versus 22 of 33 for patients with isolated banding of the pulmonary trunk, p less than 0.001). After isolated banding, there was a lower ratio of the ventricular septal defect to ascending aorta diameters at presentation in the patients who developed subaortic stenosis than in the patients who did not (0.60 +/- 0.08 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.001). Of the latter, 18 (95%) of 19 patients fulfilled criteria for a Fontan procedure at recatheterization. Thus, the presence of aortic arch obstruction is associated with rapid development of subaortic stenosis after banding of the pulmonary trunk. Alternative initial surgery, even though high risk, may be indicated. In the absence of such obstruction, banding the pulmonary trunk can be performed at reasonable risk and, provided that the ventricular septal defect is of adequate size, satisfactorily prepares most patients for a later Fontan procedure. 
5	Treatment of scaphoid nonunion by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone graft, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw. Ten adult male patients with scaphoid nonunions were treated by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw. The mean patient age was 24.7 years, and the mean duration of the nonunion before surgery was 37.3 months. Mean follow-up time was 30.4 months. Nine of the ten nonunions healed, although one patient required a second bone-grafting procedure. The mean postoperative grip strength was 45.0 kg, and the mean postoperative pinch strength was 11.5 kg. The mean postoperative range of motion was volar flexion, 76.1 degrees; dorsiflexion, 74.2 degrees; radial deviation, 22.1 degrees; and ulnar deviation, 40.1 degrees. The scapholunate angle decreased from a mean of 72.8 degrees preoperatively to 60.6 degrees postoperatively (p less than 0.025). The mean carpal index was 0.57 postoperatively. Mean scaphoid length increased postoperatively and was within 0.2 mm of the opposite (normal) scaphoid in every patient except the single patient with a persistent nonunion (p less than 0.025). All patients returned to work (eight as laborers), and nine of ten wrists were subjectively rated as good or excellent. The results of the series suggests that treatment of displaced scaphoid nonunion by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw is an effective method of treatment that reconstitutes scaphoid anatomy and promotes excellent wrist function. 
2	Proposal of a modified scintigraphic method to evaluate duodenogastroesophageal reflux. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-HIDA offers a noninvasive method to detect duodenogastric reflux. Biliary reflux was graded using the persistence rather than the intensity of the radioactive refluxate: Grade 0 was considered the absence of reflux, minimal reflux, or reflux in the first 10-15 min; Grade 1 was repetitive reflux lasting less than 10 min; Grade 2 was persistent reflux; and Grade 3 was reflux up to the esophagus. Twenty-five patients with foregut symptoms were studied and results were compared to 24-hr gastric pH monitoring. Scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed in 15 out of 25 patients (60%), but no correlation was found with the endoscopic findings. The rationale for this approach is based on pathophysiologic evidence that damage to gastric and/or esophageal mucosa is mainly related to the prolonged contact time with duodenal contents. This technique seems to allow a complete functional evaluation of the esophagogastroduodenal tract without causing adjunctive irradiation or discomfort to the patient. 
2	Plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is related to liver function but not to portal-systemic shunting, systemic vascular resistance, or urinary sodium excretion. We tested the hypothesis that increased plasma glucagon concentration resulting from portal-systemic shunting or liver dysfunction causes arterial vasodilation and thereby stimulates sodium retention in cirrhosis. Twenty-seven studies were performed in patients with alcoholic liver disease, 11 of whom had ascites. Liver function was quantitated as the elimination rate of antipyrine, caffeine, and stable isotopes of cholic acid administered both orally (2,2,4,4-2H) and intravenously (24-13C). Portal-systemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Cardiac output was measured by using Doppler echocardiography. Plasma glucagon concentration was increased in patients with ascites when compared with that in patients without ascites (474 +/- 180 pg/ml vs 245 +/- 120 pg/ml, p = 0.0007) but was unrelated to urinary sodium excretion, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.48, 0.35, -0.13, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively). Plasma glucagon concentration correlated with the half-lives of all model compounds (r = 0.58, p = 0.002; r = 0.62, p = 0.0008; r = 0.62, p = 0.001; and r = 0.64, p = 0.0005; for caffeine, antipyrine, oral and intravenous cholic acid, respectively) but not with shunt fraction (r = 0.14). Increased plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is probably a result of diminished hepatic clearance. However, increased plasma concentration of glucagon does not appear to cause a hyperdynamic circulatory state or sodium retention. 
5	Comparison of clinical and electrophysiologic features of preexcitation syndromes in patients presenting initially after age 50 years with those presenting at younger ages. Although patients may develop arrhythmias due to preexcitation syndromes at any time from the prenatal period to late adulthood, presentation in late adulthood is considered uncommon and has not been well studied. From June 1981 to June 1989, 73 patients were documented to have preexcitation syndromes on the basis of electrophysiologic studies. Those whose initial arrhythmias appeared at an age greater than 50 years (group 1, n = 13) were compared with the remaining 60 patients (group 2). All group 1 patients presented in the setting of acute medical or surgical diseases (n = 7), or chronic cardiac disease (n = 6) commonly associated with middle age and often with atrial arrhythmias; only 13 group 2 patients had underlying illnesses (p = 0.0001). Almost two-thirds of group 2 patients were evaluated because of narrow complex orthodromic tachycardia or palpitations and electrocardiographic evidence of preexcitation. Wide complex tachycardia was more often a reason for referral of older patients (7 of 13 vs 11 of 60, p less than 0.05), among whom atrial fibrillation/flutter also tended to be more frequent (4 of 13 vs 11 of 60, difference not significant). The PR and QRS intervals of group 1 patients were within the normal range and differed significantly from those of group 2 patients (PR, 0.15 +/- 0.04 vs 0.11 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001; QRS, 0.09 +/- 0.01 vs 0.12 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001), making electrocardiographic identification of preexcitation more difficult in group 1. Several factors likely contributed. 
4	UK-68,798: a novel, potent and highly selective class III antiarrhythmic agent which blocks potassium channels in cardiac cells. UK-68,798 increased the duration and effective refractory period of cardiac action potentials recorded in vitro from canine ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers in a concentration dependent manner from 5 nM to 1 microM. The resting membrane potential, amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity of action potentials were unaffected by UK-68,798, indicating the selective class III antiarrhythmic properties of this agent. UK-68,798 (5 nM-1 microM) increased the effective refractory period of isolated guinea pig papillary muscles at stimulation frequencies of 1 Hz and 5 Hz without influencing the conduction velocity, further confirming that UK-68,798 is devoid of class I antiarrhythmic activity including block of the sodium channel. Studies using single voltage clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated that UK-68,798 at concentrations of 50 nM and 2 microM blocks a time-dependent K+ current, with no appreciable effects on the time-independent K+ current or the inward calcium current. UK-68,798 is therefore a highly selective K+ channel blocking agent with class III antiarrhythmic properties, a profile that holds considerable promise for the therapy of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. 
5	Rectourethral fistula caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. A 35-year-old man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex was evaluated for a persistent urethral discharge, pneumaturia and watery diarrhea. Radiographic and endoscopic procedures established the diagnosis of a rectourethral fistula. Perineal exploration and excision of the fistula revealed the pathological diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. The differential diagnosis of an acquired rectourethral fistula and the significance of Kaposi's sarcoma are discussed. 
5	Cloning of a gene that is rearranged in patients with choroideraemia Choroideraemia (tapetochoroidal dystrophy, TCD), a common form of X-linked blindness, is characterized by progressive dystrophy of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium and retina. Previous studies have assigned the TCD gene to a small segment of the Xq21 band. By making use of reverse genetics strategies we have isolated eight overlapping complementary DNA clones from the same chromosomal region. The corresponding gene is expressed in retina, choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. The cDNAs encompass an open reading frame of 948 base pairs that is structurally altered in eight TCD patients with deletions, and in a female patient with a balanced translocation involving Xq21. These findings provide strong evidence that we have cloned the gene underlying choroideraemia. Elucidation of its function should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for this disorder and other hereditary retinopathies. 
5	Distribution of pulmonary capillary transit times in recruited networks. When pulmonary blood flow is elevated, hypoxemia can occur in the fastest-moving erythrocytes if their transit times through the capillaries fall below the minimum time for complete oxygenation. This desaturation is more likely to occur if the distribution of capillary transit times about the mean is large. Increasing cardiac output is known to decrease mean pulmonary capillary transit time, but the effect on the distribution of transit times has not been reported. We measured the mean and variance of transit times in single pulmonary capillary networks in the dependent lung of anesthetized dogs by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein dye bolus passing from an arteriole to a venule. When cardiac output increased from 2.9 to 9.9 l/min, mean capillary transit time decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 s. Because transit time variance decreased proportionately (relative dispersion remained constant), increasing cardiac output did not alter the heterogeneity of local capillary transit times in the lower lung where the capillary bed was nearly fully recruited. 
5	Clinical characteristics and treatment of isolated inferior rectus paralysis. Isolated inferior rectus paralysis without mechanical restriction of the globe has received only scant attention in the literature. The authors report on 21 patients treated during the past 16 years. The etiology was congenital, traumatic, myasthenic, and vascular. Anomalous head posture, diplopia, or a disfiguring hypertropia were presenting symptoms. Diagnosis was made on the basis of the prism and cover test in the diagnostic positions and on examination of ductions and versions. The direction of the head tilt, the Bielschowsky head tilt test, and tests for cyclotropia are only of secondary diagnostic value since they may give paradoxical results. Surgery consisted of resection of the paralyzed muscle, combined with or without recession of its antagonist and/or recession of the contralateral superior oblique. After a mean follow-up of 17 months, 14 patients were cured, 6 had improved, and 1 remained unchanged. 
5	The natural history of lumbar intervertebral disc extrusions treated nonoperatively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural history of morphologic changes within the lumbar spine in patients who sustained lumbar disc extrusions. All patients in this study were treated nonoperatively for radicular pain and neurologic loss. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does perithecal or perineural fibrosis result when extrusions are not removed surgically, and 2) Do disc extrusions spontaneously resolve, and, if so, how rapidly? The study population consisted of 11 patients with extrusions and radiculopathy. All patients were successfully treated nonoperatively. All had a primary complaint of leg pain and all had positive straight leg raising reproducing their leg pain at less than or equal to 60 degrees. Additionally, 87% had muscle weakness on a neurologic basis in a root level distribution corresponding to the site of disc pathology. Computed tomographic (CT) examinations were obtained on all patients at the inception of treatment. These studies were compared with follow-up MRI studies. The initial CT scans were evaluated for the following criteria: disc size and position, thecal sac effacement, nerve root enlargement or displacement, and evidence of central or intervertebral canal stenosis. In addition to the pathomorphology evaluated on the CT scans, follow-up MRI studies also evaluated disc hydration at the herniated and contiguous levels, and the presence of perithecal or perineural fibrosis. The following grading system was used to evaluate change in fragment size on the follow-up studies: Grade 1-0 to 50% decrease in size; Grade 2-50 to 75% decrease in size; Grade 3-75 to 100% decrease in size. 
2	Relationships of somatic symptoms to behavioral and emotional risk in young adolescents. Junior high students (n = 1508) from a midwestern community completed a health behavioral questionnaire that asked the frequency of headache and abdominal pain and of a number of behavioral and emotional risk indicators. Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints. The evaluation of persistent somatic complaints in adolescents, particularly in boys with abdominal symptoms, should include careful examination of emotional risk factors and other health-endangering behaviors such as substance use, early sexual activity, and delinquency. 
4	Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Minimizing the danger. Patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are at an increased risk of sudden death. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of beta blockers and possibly amiodarone, have not been particularly effective in reducing mortality. Beta blockers have been used successfully to treat survivors of myocardial infarction, including patients with significant impairment of ventricular function. Evidence to date suggests that use of low-dose amiodarone may be appropriate for selected patients with chronic heart failure and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. 
5	Prehospital care: the future of emergency medical services. Most prehospital interventions, both pharmacologic and procedural, have been accepted without clear demonstrations of their abilities to impact patient outcomes or without clear indications that withholding or delaying the intervention pending arrival at a definitive emergency department will adversely affect the patient. Interventions that have the benefit of supportive research have been applied equally to urban and nonurban emergency medical services environments. In selecting interventions, inadequate consideration has been given to the differences in emergency medical services personnel training, frequencies of their exposure to patients, frequencies of skill use, and availabilities of effective continuing education programs in the urban and nonurban environments. These issues are discussed, and the necessary focus of the future of emergency medical services in urban, suburban, and rural environments is predicted. 
1	Endometrial cancer: biochemical and clinical correlates. Some endometrial cancers and endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines show amplified expression of proto-oncogenes (fos, fms, myc, myb, neu, and erb-B) and augmented production of growth factors (colony-stimulating factor 1, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta) and epidermal growth factor receptor. Oncogene expression, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and the fraction of cells in S phase are useful biochemical prognostic indicators of clinical outcome, and markers recognized by monoclonal antibodies are available for use in following the clinical course of the disease and responses to treatment. In vivo and in vitro studies on normal and neoplastic tissues are providing evidence of paracrine influences on epithelial cell proliferation. Long-term administration of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer has recently been found to increase the risk for development of endometrial cancer. 
5	Prospective randomized comparison of esophageal variceal sclerotherapy agents: sodium tetradecyl sulfate versus sodium morrhuate. We designed a prospective randomized study to evaluate differences in efficacy and complication rate between the two most commonly used sclerosing agents, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STD) and sodium morrhuate (MOR). Of 41 patients with acute index variceal bleeding initially evaluated, 21 were randomized to receive 0.75% STD and 20 to receive 1.6% MOR diluted with 50% dextrose. Overall mortality for the STD group was 38% and that for the MOR group was 25% (NS). Control of acute bleeding was achieved in 86% of the STD patients and 90% of the MOR patients (NS). Overall, obliteration was achieved in only 33% of the STD group and 25% of the MOR group; but in those patients who remained in the study over 3 months, obliteration was achieved in 87 and 83%, respectively (NS). There was a trend toward higher rebleeding in the STD group compared with the MOR group (81% vs. 51%) (p = 0.078), but there was no significant difference between the STD and MOR patients with regard to transfusion requirements (8.4 units/patient vs. 8.7 units/patient), ulceration (53% vs. 40%), or stricture formation (9.5% vs. 0.0%). The results of this study suggest that STD and MOR are clinically equivalent sclerosing solutions, and that bias favoring use of one agent over the other may be unfounded. 
3	Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms. Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. 
1	Reduced psychological morbidity after breast conservation. Psychological morbidity was compared in 52 patients treated by mastectomy and 67 patients treated by lumpectomy for early breast cancer. An informal counselling service was provided for all patients. Morbidity was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery with two self-rating scales: the general health questionnaire and the Leeds depression and anxiety scales. There was a significant excess of severe depression in the mastectomy group. In contrast to the findings of previous research, this result suggests that breast conservation reduces psychological morbidity. 
4	Wives of coronary high-risk men--are they also at higher risk? The Tromso Heart Study. Blood lipids, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking, dietary and exercise habits were studied in 911 wives of men with high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Following the 1979/80 Tromso Survey, 1373 men, aged 30-54 years, were identified as having high risk for CHD (HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol less than or equal to 17.6% and/or total cholesterol greater than or equal to 7.86 mmol l-1). Of the 1373 men, 911 individuals had wives who also attended the screening. These wives were compared to age-matched, married women in the general population. A significantly higher total cholesterol level (5.98 mmol l-1 vs. 5.78 mmol l-1), lower HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (30.01% vs. 31.58%), higher BMI and higher coronary risk score (4.55 vs. 3.82) was found among the wives of the high-risk men. Furthermore, a higher proportion of these individuals were daily cigarette smokers (47.3% vs. 42.1%), and had received fewer years of education. They also had more dietary habits associated with increased risk of CHD than other married women in the general population. Our findings support the hypothesis that members of the same household as a person with increased risk for CHD also have increased risk. This is most probably due to shared lifestyle. 
2	Involvement of thromboxane and neutrophils in multiple-system organ edema with interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) produces toxicity characterized by generalized edema within 24 hours. This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment. 
4	Excess purine degradation caused by an imbalance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate in patients with congestive heart failure. To evaluate purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure concentrations of serum hypoxanthine, lactate, and noradrenaline were measured before and after submaximal treadmill exercise in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and nine healthy volunteers. In four patients the concentration of hypoxanthine was significantly higher than in the controls or in the remaining eight patients with congestive heart failure. Venous lactate and noradrenaline in the four patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine were also significantly higher than those in the eight patients with normal concentrations of hypoxanthine. Patients who responded normally were also more likely to have been treated with vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise induced arrhythmias were more common in the patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the excess purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure might be the result of a "relative" disturbance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate caused by the shift of cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis during submaximal exercise and that hypoxanthine (a substrate for xanthine oxidase and a source of free radicals) was increased after submaximal exercise in some patients with congestive heart failure. 
1	Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. 
3	Long-term follow-up of patients operated on for recurrent carotid stenosis. We reviewed our experience with 29 operations for recurrent carotid stenosis in 27 patients who underwent both their primary carotid endarterectomy and their reoperations at our institution. These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy. 
1	Serum erythropoietin levels in the anaemia of chronic disorders. Serum erythropoietin (S-EPO) levels were measured in 50 patients with anaemia of chronic disorders (ACD), classified into three groups according to their aetiology: inflammatory (n = 20), infectious (n = 15) and neoplastic (n = 15). The inflammatory group showed a higher mean S-EPO level (mean value +/- SEM, 69 +/- 11 mU ml-1) than the neoplastic (43 +/- 5 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05) and infectious groups (27 +/- 4 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). The S-EPO level in the inflammatory group also differed from that of 32 healthy controls (36 +/- 3 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05). Fourteen patients with added iron deficiency (12 subjects from the inflammatory group) showed the highest S-EPO concentration (72 +/- 17 mU ml-1). Conversely, S-EPO levels were lower in febrile subjects (12 patients with infection and five with malignancy) than in non-febrile patients (28 +/- 4 mU ml-1 vs. 55 +/- 7 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). In the infectious group, the logarithm of S-EPO correlated directly with the haemoglobin and haematocrit values. We conclude that differences in S-EPO concentration in ACD may be further related to the patient's iron stores and temperature. A decrease in EPO production may contribute to the pathogenesis of ACD secondary to infection. 
5	Percutaneous nucleotomy. An anatomic study of the risks of root injury. Fifteen cadaveric dissections have been performed to determine the anatomic relationships of nucleotomy guide wires. All the 44 guide wires inserted were found to be in contact with at least one nerve root (eight transfixed a root). Guide wires passing anterior to the nerve roots always passed anterior to the center of the disc. Lateral displacement of the skin entry point made safe entry to the center of the disc impossible. Nerve root transfixion is likely to be a significant complication in percutaneous nucleotomy. Entry to the center of the disc avoiding the nerve roots is simplest if the skin entry is as near to the midline as possible. 
2	Blood contacts during surgical procedures Operating room personnel are at risk for infection with blood-borne pathogens through blood contact. To describe the nature and frequency of blood contact and its risk factors, trained observers monitored a sample of operations performed by six surgical services at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Ga, for 6 months. In 62 (30.1%) of 206 operations, at least one blood contact was observed. Of 1828 operating room person-procedures observed, 96 (5.3%) had 147 blood contacts (133 skin contacts [90%], 10 percutaneous injuries [7%], and four eye splashes [3%]). The mean number of blood contacts per 100 person-procedures was highest for surgeons (18.6). The frequency of percutaneous injury was similar among surgeons and scrub staff (mean, 1.2 per 100 worker-procedures for each group). Risk factors for surgeons' blood contacts were (1) performing a trauma, burn, or orthopedic emergency procedure (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 8.7); (2) patient blood loss exceeding 250mL (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7); and (3) being in the operating room longer than 1 hour (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1). Of 110 blood contacts among surgeons, 81 (74%) were potentially preventable by additional barrier precautions, such as face shields and fluid-resistant gowns. Twenty-one (84%) of 25 blood contacts among surgeons in procedures in which all three risk factors were present were potentially preventable by additional barriers. Of 29 blood contacts among anesthesia and circulating personnel, 20 (69%) would have been prevented by glove use. For surgical procedures in which operating room personnel are at increased risk of blood contact, reevaluation of surgical technique, use of appropriate barrier precautions, and development of puncture-resistant glove materials are indicated. 
2	Prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding. The prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding was evaluated prospectively in 203 separate admissions for bleeding esophageal varices in 145 cirrhotic patients. During all admissions a standardized protocol of management defined the failure of transfusion and vasoactive drugs (conservative measures) to stop bleeding and the occurrence of early rebleeding, at which time either emergency sclerotherapy or a staple transection of the esophagus was used. The finding of a white nipple in 18 admissions (9%) did not have predictive value as regards the failure of conservative measures to stop bleeding within 24 hours or rebleeding within 5 days, and there was no association with increased mortality. In one case, a white nipple was seen to occur after spontaneous cessation of a variceal venous spurt, suggesting it is a platelet-fibrin plug. The white nipple sign is diagnostic of a varix that has bled but has no adverse prognostic significance. 
4	Optimizing heparin utilization in angiographic flush solutions. Various concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are employed during angiography. In an effort to determine whether differences in outcome are seen when either high or low concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are utilized, two groups of patients were evaluated. There was no difference in outcome and a small systemic effect from heparin was seen in both groups. Use of a low concentration of heparin is suggested for routine angiography. 
2	Hepatic portal venous gas identified by computed tomography in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma: a case report. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan in a middle-aged man injured in a high-speed motor vehicle accident demonstrated the presence of portal venous gas. Findings on initial peritoneal lavage were entirely negative. Exploratory celiotomy performed because of increasing abdominal pain and leukocytosis revealed gangrene of the cecum. This report illustrates the importance of the finding of portal venous gas on CT scan in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. 
1	Transhepatic portal vein catheterization for localization of insulinomas: a ten-year experience. One of the most important factors in the management of insulinomas is the ability to localize the tumor accurately either before or during surgery. We prospectively carried out transhepatic portal venous sampling (THPVS) for tumor localization in 35 of 40 patients with organic hyperinsulinism during a 10-year period. In 32 patients who underwent THPVS and in whom a single tumor was subsequently identified surgically, the maximal insulin gradient was located in the vicinity of the tumor in 100% of cases. Specific regionalization of the tumor on the basis of the site of the maximal insulin gradient to one of three regions (the tail, the body/neck region, and the head/uncinate region) gave a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 91%. In contrast, the use of specific cutoff levels for the insulin gradient as a guide to the presence of a tumor in one of these three regions did not increase the accuracy, leading instead to a significant loss of sensitivity with no comparable increase in specificity. There were no major complications from the procedure in any patient. The initial use of computed tomographic/ultrasound scanning and selective angiography localized only 46% of tumors, whereas subsequent THPVS led to the accurate preoperative localization of 100% of all tumors submitted to surgery. Although the surgeon would have identified 81% of the tumors correctly at operation, in 19% (n = 6) he would have failed. Four tumors were in the uncinate and two were in the head. It seems that in patients with proved or established organic hyperinsulinism, THPVS may continue to be of value, if only to regionalize the tumor, especially those in the pancreatic head and uncinate process so as to preclude noncurative operations on the body and tail of the pancreas. 
4	The clinical utility of carotid duplex scanning. We retrospectively compared the results of duplex scanning (DS) with contrast angiography (CAN) in the evaluation of 119 patients whose 238 carotid arteries were evaluated by both methods within a four-week period. The results of all patients were then categorized by two different definitions of severity of stenosis. Category A classified 1-29% stenosis as mild, 30-69% stenosis as moderate, and 70-99% diameter reduction as severe stenosis. Category B defined mild stenosis as 1-19% lumen diameter reduction, moderate as 20-49% stenosis, and severe as 50-99% stenosis. The findings by each classification were compared in 60 patients with hemispheric symptoms and in 59 patients with nonspecific symptoms. CAN was our "gold standard", and exhibited greater sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than DS. Carotid arteries with 70% stenosis were identified by DS with greater specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than were arteries with 50% stenoses. Only the sensitivity was comparable in categorizations A and B (80% and 83%). All parameters of measurement were superior in patients with hemispheric symptoms. DS alone cannot substitute for CAN in selecting patients for carotid endarterectomy because its error rate exceeded acceptable rates of complications for carotid artery surgery. The false positive rate of DS was 4%. DS failed to diagnose 7 of 19 carotid artery occlusions, 9 of 11 ulcerated plaques, 7 of 119 instances of aortic arch disease, and 13 cases of severe intracranial artery stenosis. 
3	The shoulder in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. One hundred shoulders were assessed in 50 patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, of which one-third were found to have bilateral symptoms. Two distinct clinical and radiological groups emerged. Those with minor epiphyseal abnormalities developed painful osteoarthritis in middle age, but retained shoulder movement until the secondary changes were advanced. Those with 'hatchet head' shoulders likewise became painful in the fifth and sixth decades but had minimal glenohumeral movement from an early stage. 
4	Aortico-left ventricular tunnel: long-term outcome after surgical repair. Over a 14 year period, four children (three male, one female) underwent surgical correction of an aortico-left ventricular tunnel. All presented in infancy (age range 5 days to 9 months). The presenting feature was a systolic and diastolic murmur in all, one of whom developed heart failure within 2 weeks of presentation. In the first two patients, the echocardiographic findings were inconclusive and the diagnosis was confirmed at cardiac catheterization (at 10 and 23 months of age, respectively); the other two were diagnosed echocardiographically by two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging. All four patients underwent surgery by patch closure of the aortic end of the tunnel (three patients) or direct suture closure (one patient) and there were no deaths. The mean age at operation was 11 months. During a mean follow-up period of 71 months (range 2 to 157), three patients have clinical and echocardiographic evidence of trivial aortic valve regurgitation, which was noted in the immediate postoperative period in one and at early (less than 6 months) follow-up study in the other two. All are symptom-free, are taking no medications and are growing and developing normally. Aortico-left ventricular tunnel can be accurately diagnosed by echocardiography. In patients presenting in infancy, echocardiography also provides the necessary morphologic information to enable surgical correction without angiography. Early operation is associated with an excellent outcome, whereas repair at a later age is associated with a high incidence of residual aortic regurgitation requiring further surgery. 
2	Abdominal sparganosis in Ecuador: a case report. Sparganosis, infection with plerocercoids of the pseudophyllidean tapeworm Spirometra, rarely has been described in Ecuador. We report the details of a human case of sparganosis identified serendipitously in the course of an abdominal hernia repair. The parasite was found moving freely upon the external oblique fascia adjacent to the site of a direct abdominal hernia. The organism was recovered intact, photographed while alive and preserved for subsequent detailed morphological studies. The presumed route of entry into this patient was percutaneous, after application of a poultice of snake flesh to the site of a painful abdominal hernia. The literature on sparganosis in South America is reviewed. This is the second case of human sparganosis reported from Ecuador. 
1	Undifferentiated carcinoma of the ovary. Thirty-five cases of ovarian carcinomas, which had as the predominant histologic component solid areas of epithelial cells without differentiation into mullerian carcinomas, were reviewed. The patients' ages ranged from 39 to 72 years (mean age, 54 years). Two patients had clinical stage I disease, one had stage II, 26 had stage III, and six had stage IV. Microscopically, the malignant cells formed large groups or sheets with desmoplastic stroma around them. Foci of papillary serous carcinoma, unclassified adenocarcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma were seen in 26 tumors, foci of necrosis were seen in 30 tumors, and vascular invasion was seen in seven tumors. Six of 13 carcinomas tested expressed CA125 reactivity, and 12 of 13 carcinomas reacted to B72.3 monoclonal antibody. The primary tumors were treated by aggressive surgical reduction in 32 patients and by multiple biopsy procedures in three patients. After the first operation, 30 patients had residual disease, smaller than 2 cm in five patients and larger than 2 cm in 23 patients. After surgery, 33 patients received chemotherapy; three of these 33 also received radiotherapy. One patient was treated with postsurgical radiotherapy only, and one patient refused further treatment. Thirty-four patients (97%) died of disease between 8 and 108 months (mean, 27 months) after initial surgery, 29 patients died in less than 32 months. Four patients (11%) survived more than 5 years: two patients with stage I disease who died at 82 and 102 months, one patient with stage II who died at 72 months, and one patient with stage III who has no evidence of disease after 116 months. Five-year survival of patients with undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma is worse than the reported survival of patients with serous carcinoma or ovarian carcinoma with a pattern resembling transitional cell carcinoma. The distinction between these three carcinomas that have solid areas carries prognostic significance. 
1	Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases. Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele. By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter. We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated. 
5	The electrocardiographic manifestations of cyclic antidepressant therapy and overdose: a review. Cyclic antidepressants may cause changes in the electrocardiogram at therapeutic or toxic serum levels. The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For "first generation" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias. 
3	The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: effect of patch polarity on defibrillation threshold. An automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) was implanted in 40 patients with sudden cardiac arrest (n = 29), sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (n = 10) or recurrent syncope (n = 1) who were unsuitable for direct ablative surgery or had had unsuccessful medical therapy. The effect of patch electrode polarity on the defibrillation threshold was prospectively evaluated. Two large epicardial patches were used. Initial polarity was selected at random. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by direct current and a preestablished defibrillation protocol employed to assess the minimal energy that would reproducibly defibrillate the heart. Nineteen patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with the inferior left ventricular patch as an anode and nine patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with this patch as a cathode. In general, the defibrillation threshold was lower when this patch was used as an anode than when it was used as a cathode (18 +/- 10 versus 22.6 +/- 12.2 J; p less than 0.01). No preoperative variable predicted optimal polarity. Therefore, the effect of patch polarity on defibrillation threshold should be assessed in each patient at the time of AICD implantation so that the safety margin for satisfactory device function can be maximized. 
5	Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of chronic sinusitis in children. A review of outpatients diagnosed with sinusitis during the previous year by the allergy services of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Kaiser Permanente, Orange County, revealed 34 patients who had protracted discomforting and debilitating symptoms. The mean duration of symptoms was approximately six months (range 1-14 months). None had been previously diagnosed as having sinusitis or received appropriate treatment. Although all were referred for evaluation of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, approximately 1/3 were found to have neither of these conditions. Among patients who had asthma, their asthmatic symptoms were aggravated by the sinusitis. All patients eventually responded favorably to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Earlier diagnosis and appropriate therapy would have foreshortened the course of this very discomforting condition. In recent years, we have observed a marked increase in the number of patients referred with the chief complaint of "worsening allergy" and who were subsequently found to have sinusitis. Most of the patients experienced significant incapacitation for protracted periods before a correct diagnosis was made and treatment instituted. In all but a few cases, prompt and sustained improvement followed appropriate therapy. The purpose of this report is to present a retrospective review of 34 illustrative cases. 
2	Correlation between laboratory findings and clinical outcome after restorative proctocolectomy: serial studies in 20 patients with end-to-end pouch-anal anastomosis. Clinical function and anorectal physiological function were assessed and correlated in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis before restorative proctocolectomy and 3, 7, and 12 months after operation. The entire anal sphincter was preserved by means of a stapled pouch-anal anastomosis. Before operation, the median resting anal pressure was 79 cmH2O (interquartile range 70-89 cmH2O), the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was present in all patients and anorectal 'sampling' was noted in 16 of 20 patients. Three months after operation, resting anal pressure was 68 cmH2O (range 50-87 cmH2O) (P less than 0.001), the reflex was present in only three patients (P less than 0.001) and sampling was observed in one patient. After 7 months, resting anal pressure was 76 cmH2O (range 64-89 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 11 patients and sampling was observed in nine patients. At 12 months, resting anal pressure was 84 cmH2O (range 66-94 cmH2O), the reflex was present in 19 patients and sampling was observed in 17 patients. The compliance and capacity of the reservoir increased significantly. Ability to discriminate flatus from faeces was associated with return of the rectoanal reflex and sampling. 
5	Continuous arteriovenous rewarming: experimental results and thermodynamic model simulation of treatment for hypothermia. We evaluated a technique for treating hypothermia that uses extracorporeal circulation but does not require heparin or pump assistance. Hypothermia to 29.5 degrees C was induced in eight anesthetized dogs, and thermistors placed in the pulmonary artery, liver, bladder, esophagus, rectum, muscle, and skin. Four experimental animals were rewarmed by creating a fistula which connected arterial and venous femoral lines to an interposed counter-current heat exchanger. External rewarming was used in four controls. Bleeding time (BT), coagulation profile (PT, PTT, TT), and cardiac output (CO) were measured during rewarming. Core temperature (T) rose significantly faster with CAVR (0.00001). Average time to rewarming was 45 min, vs. 4 hrs in controls. Haptoglobin, platelet, fibrinogen, and fibrin split product levels were unaffected. Continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR) improved T, CO, BT, and coagulation profile faster than any method yet reported not requiring heparin or cardiac bypass. The application of CAVR in post-traumatic hypothermia warrants further investigation. 
5	Preventive therapy of first gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: results of a controlled trial comparing propranolol, endoscopic sclerotherapy and placebo. Propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices are the two approaches currently used in prophylaxis of the first gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the cirrhotic patient. One hundred twenty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and no histories of bleeding were included in the trial regardless of the gravity of the cirrhosis or the size of the esophageal varices. Patients with hepatocarcinomas or other cancers, clearly impossible follow-up, previous treatment for portal hypertension or contraindication to beta-blockers were excluded. After randomization, 43 patients received propranolol twice daily at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%; 42 patients were treated with intravariceal and extravariceal injections of Polidocanol; 41 control patients received vitamin K orally as placebo. The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo. 
5	Airflow obstruction after substance P aerosol: contribution of airway and pulmonary edema. We have studied the effects of aerosolized substance P (SP) in guinea pigs with reference to lung resistance and dynamic compliance changes and their recovery after hyperinflation. In addition, we have examined the concomitant formation of airway microvascular leakage and lung edema. Increasing breaths of SP (1.5 mg/ml, 1.1 mM), methacholine (0.15 mg/ml, 0.76 mM), or 0.9% saline were administered to tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. Lung resistance (RL) increased dose dependently with a maximum effect of 963 +/- 85% of baseline values (mean +/- SE) after SP (60 breaths) and 1,388 +/- 357% after methacholine (60 breaths). After repeated hyperinflations, methacholine-treated animals returned to baseline, but after SP, mean RL was still raised (292 +/- 37%; P less than 0.005). Airway microvascular leakage, measured by extravasation of Evans Blue dye, occurred in the brain bronchi and intrapulmonary airways after SP but not after methacholine. There was a significant correlation between RL after hyperinflation and Evans Blue dye extravasation in intrapulmonary airways (distal: r = 0.89, P less than 0.005; proximal: r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). Examination of frozen sections for peribronchial and perivascular cuffs of edema and for alveolar flooding showed significant degrees of pulmonary edema for animals treated with SP compared with those treated with methacholine or saline. We conclude that the inability of hyperinflation to fully reverse changes in RL after SP may be due to the formation of both airway and pulmonary edema, which may also contribute to the deterioration in RL. 
1	The Patterns of Care Outcome Study for cancer of the uterine cervix. Results of the Second National Practice Survey. This report summarizes the outcome results of the Patterns of Care Study (PCS) of cancer of the uterine cervix from 565 patients treated in 1978. The 5-year survival with no evidence of disease was: Stage I, 74%; Stage II, 56%; and Stage III, 33%. The 5-year local in-field failure rate was: Stage I, 12%, Stage II, 27%; and Stage III, 51%. Extent of parametrial involvement, unilateral versus bilateral, may be important in determining survival and local failure. The four-year actuarial survival was 58% for unilateral involvement versus 47% for bilateral (P = 0.06), and the local failure rate was 32% for unilateral versus 45% for bilateral (P less than 0.05). When analyzed by stage, patients with Stage IIb disease with unilateral parametrial involvement showed a trend toward improved survival and decreased local failure compared with those with bilateral Stage IIb cancers (P = 0.1). The use of intracavitary irradiation significantly improved survival and reduced local failures. Furthermore, the number of intracavitary applications was important. When two or more intracavitary applications were used compared with one application, local in-field failure was significantly reduced, 29% versus 17% at 4 years (P less than 0.001), and four-year survival was improved, 60% versus 73% (P = 0.01). The four-year actuarial rate of major complications depended on the stage: Stage I, 8%; Stage II, 15%; and Stage III, 13%. There was a statistically significant increase in major complications in patients undergoing laparotomy for staging versus no laparotomy 23% versus 11% at 4 years (P less than or equal to 0.01) and a trend toward increased major complications in patients who were thin or had prior abdominal surgery. This study confirmed the stage-dependent outcome of treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix with radiation and indicated that further division of Stage IIb to indicate prognostic significance of unilateral or bilateral parametrial involvement may be warranted. This study also confirmed the importance of intracavitary radiation in optimizing control established by the 1973 PCS. It further suggests that where possible, two intracavitary insertions may yield better results than one insertion. 
5	Educational policies. It is vital that teachers, parents, and health professionals recognize the major educational problems that affect students with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy should be placed in the least restrictive schooling environment so that social, emotional, and educational requirements can be met in a setting best suited to the individual's present needs and future development. Personal assessment and monitoring of progress form an equally important part of a child's educational program in integrated schools, but there is a need to develop suitable instruments to assist teachers in their assessments and decision making. In Australia, the National Epilepsy Association has developed an "Alert Kit" based on the Epilepsy Foundation of Americas "School Alert Kit" to provide basic medical information on epilepsy to teachers and pupils. 
3	Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 4. Specific disorders. This self-directed learning module highlights important aspects of medical rehabilitation of patients with brain disorders. The specific disorders reviewed in this module are traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and other degenerative disorders. This module is a section of the chapter on rehabilitation of brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. Emphasis is given in this section on key elements of current medical practice, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, and outcome. Neurologic assessment and management is highlighted for coma, amnesia, cranial nerve and late intracranial complications, postacute management, and postconcussive syndromes. The learner is directed to articles 1, 2, and 3 in this chapter for supporting information. 
2	Update on the epidemiology of anorexia nervosa in a defined region of Switzerland. In this follow-up investigation, the authors studied all Swiss women in the canton of Zurich who developed anorexia nervosa between ages 12 and 25 years and who were hospitalized for the first time with this diagnosis between 1983 and 1985. Data were compared with those from an earlier study, which focused on the periods 1956-1958, 1963-1965, and 1973-1975. The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975. However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. 
5	Spontaneous splenic rupture following infectious mononucleosis. Four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been treated at this institution since 1978. The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis. Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients. However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients. Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy. In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture. Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction. 
2	Barium meals in the elderly--a quality reassurance. The consecutive double contrast barium meal examinations of 100 elderly patients (aged over 65 years) and a group of 33 younger adult patients were analysed by two observers for technical quality and pathological abnormalities. Technical quality declined with patient age, especially in those over 75 years, but was sufficient to enable diagnosis of abnormalities in 60% of the elderly group. It is concluded that, in the majority of elderly patients, the technical quality of double contrast barium meal examinations is sufficiently high to offer considerable diagnostic utility. 
2	Gallstone disease in north India: clinical and ultrasound profile in a referral hospital. We studied the prevalence of gallstones in patients with upper abdominal pain, heaviness, or discomfort by ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. The actual ultrasound examination was performed by a clinical gastroenterologist blinded to the symptoms. Of 1,680 consecutive dyspeptic patients, 500 (29.8%) had gallstones. The gallbladder was contracted in 450 (91.2%), normal-size in 36 (7.2%), and distended in 8 (1.6%). Biliary colic was more frequently the presenting complaint in patients with a contracted gallbladder than in those with normal size gallbladder (p less than 0.001). Dyspepsia was more frequent in the presence of a normal size gallbladder than a contracted one (p less than 0.001). We conclude that ultrasonography of the gallbladder by the clinician has a high diagnostic yield, and the symptom complex has an excellent correlation with the sonographic appearance. 
4	Increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in babies of hypertensive mothers. There is controversy over the effect of hypertension in pregnancy on the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. We investigated the association between maternal hypertension and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in 268 very low birthweight babies of less than 34 weeks' gestation. A lower incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was associated with growth retardation and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours. Maternal hypertension was associated with an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. We used the multiple logistic regression model to control for confounding variables, as the maternal and neonatal factors associated with respiratory distress syndrome were not evenly distributed between the two groups. After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, growth retardation, and membrane rupture greater than 24 hours, the risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome was significantly greater in babies of hypertensive mothers. Significance was lost when labour before delivery and mode of delivery were taken into account. The increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in babies of hypertensive mothers may be due to the absence of labour before delivery because of the greater likelihood of caesarean section. 
3	More than one mutant allele causes infantile Tay-Sachs disease in French-Canadians. Two Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patients of French-Canadian origin were shown by Myerowitz and Hogikyan to be homozygous for a 7.6-kb deletion mutation at the 5' end of the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit gene. In order to determine whether all French-Canadian TSD patients were homozygotes for the deletion allele and to assess the geographic origins of TSD in this population, we ascertained 12 TSD families of French-Canadian origin and screened for occurrence of mutations associated with infantile TSD. DNA samples were obtained from 12 French-Canadian TSD families. Samples were analyzed using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) or by restriction analysis of PCR products. In some cases Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed. Eighteen of the 22 independently segregating mutant chromosomes in this sample carried the 7.6-kb deletion mutation at the 5' end of the gene. One chromosome carried the 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11 (a "Jewish" mutation). In this population no individuals were detected who had the substitution at the splice junction of exon 12 previously identified in Ashkenazi Jews. One chromosome carried an undescribed B1 mutation; this allele came from a parent of non-French-Canadian origin. Patients in three families carried TSD alleles different from any of the above mutations. The 5' deletion mutation clusters in persons originating in southeastern Quebec (Gaspe) and adjacent counties of northern New Brunswick. 
3	Prolonged confusion following convulsions due to generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Among patients with a prolonged confusional state after convulsive seizure, we diagnosed 8 cases as generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Six had a history of seizures, and 2 had new onset. The convulsive seizures were generalized in 6 and focal in two. The postictal confusion lasted up to 36 hours in the most prolonged case, and a delayed response to anticonvulsant medications occurred in all cases. The clinical symptoms ranged from mild confusion to coma. Psychiatric manifestations or automatisms were rare. The presumed etiology was due to diverse causes, but a withdrawal state was the most common. EEG demonstrated continuous or nearly continuous generalized ictal discharges of variable morphology. These cases call attention to the fact that some prolonged confusional states following convulsive seizures are in fact due to persistent seizure activity that can be diagnosed by EEG. 
1	Interleukin-2: prospects for lymphocyte-mediated destruction of pediatric malignancies. Immunologic therapy of cancer was speculated on at the turn of the century. In animals, in vitro, and most recently in patients, irrefutable evidence has been obtained that lymphocyte responses can have a reproducible and beneficial antitumor effect. These results indicate that "biologic response modification" may truly become a fourth modality for cancer treatment, to be integrated into the standard approaches of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. To what extent these immune approaches may enable eradication of microscopic amounts of residual diseases in children who would otherwise have a recurrence of their malignancies remains the critical issue for testing over the next decade. Enthusiasm regarding this approach is abundant, but critical evaluation of all clinical trials is essential to best focus these mechanisms into effective therapy. 
5	Neuropathy caused by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage: case report. A case of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow produced by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and thrombocytopenia is reported. Intraneural hemorrhage in patients with bleeding disorders occurs infrequently. It consists of acute intrafascicular bleeding, presumably producing very high elevations of endoneurial fluid pressure. The clinical features and treatment of this condition are considered, the pertinent literature is reviewed, and the involved pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. 
1	Association of bcl-1 rearrangements with lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation. Previous studies using classical cytogenetics have demonstrated the presence of the t(11;14) (q13;q32) chromosomal translocation in some cases of lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation (IDL), a distinct type of low grade B-cell lymphoma. This finding suggested that the bcl-1 region (located at band q13 of chromosome 11) might be involved in this neoplasm. Using a genomic probe from the major breakpoint area of the bcl-1 locus, we identified rearrangements of the bcl-1 region in 10 of 19 cases, 2 of which comigrated with a rearranged allele of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene joining region. In contrast, bcl-1 rearrangements were not found in other types of low grade B-cell lymphoma, specifically in 36 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 27 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL). To further assess the molecular pathology of IDL, we analyzed these cases for rearrangements of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which is associated primarily with follicular lymphomas. None of the 19 cases of IDL had rearrangements. Furthermore, none of the 36 cases of CLL/SLL showed bcl-2 rearrangements, whereas, as expected, 21 of 27 cases of FL had rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus. Our findings demonstrate an association between a rearranged bcl-1 region with approximately 50% of IDLs and suggest that abnormalities of this locus may be important in the pathogenesis of IDL. 
3	Congenital mirror movements. Abnormal organization of motor pathways in two patients. We studied 2 patients with congenital mirror movements by means of various neurophysiological and metabolic techniques, including mapping of motor evoked potentials to transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation, premovement and somatosensory evoked potentials, kinematics of voluntary movements, muscle reflexes, and positron emission tomography (PET). Abnormalities in maps of motor and premovement potentials and in PET scans were consistent with a bilateral representation of hand muscles in the motor cortex, the existence of physiologically active connections capable of conducting fast efferent volleys from the motor cortex to ipsilateral muscles, the presence of mirror EMG activity in either hand with intended voluntary movement of the other hand, the absence of mirrored EMG responses from wrist flexors and extensors to mechanical perturbation of the contralateral wrist, and normal scalp distribution of somatosensory evoked potentials to right and left median nerve stimulation. Our findings are consistent with aberrant organization of motor representation areas and corticospinal pathways with ipsilateral as well as contralateral control of voluntary movement. 
1	Photopheresis for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We investigated the use of extracorporeal chemotherapy (photopheresis) in eight patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Initially described by Edelson et al. for the treatment of erythrodermic cutaneous T cell lymphoma, we have expanded the treatment to include patients with extensive patch/plaque disease as well as tumor-stage disease. Four of five patients with erythrodermic stage disease had either a complete or a partial clinical remission with photopheresis alone. One patient with extensive patch/plaque disease continued to have a partial clinical remission of 7 months' duration with photopheresis alone. Of the two patients with tumor-stage disease, one remained without evidence of clinical disease at 10 months with photopheresis alone, whereas the second patient had a partial clinical remission of 5 months with a combination of local radiation therapy followed by monthly photopheresis. The skin biopsy specimen obtained from the patient with tumor-stage disease in complete clinical remission did not show cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We conclude that photopheresis is an effective modality alone or in combination with adjunctive therapy for erythroderma, extensive patch/plaque disease, and some tumor-stage disease. 
4	Increased sensitivity to endotoxemia by tissue necrosis. In this study the interaction of endotoxemia and ischemic organ injury was investigated in a rat model. Animals received lipopolysaccharide to induce endotoxemia and were simultaneously subjected to renal ischemia. If only renal ischemia was induced, moderate azotemia occurred and all animals survived. Lipopolysaccharide treatment caused neither renal failure nor death. However, rats with both endotoxemia and renal ischemia showed severe azotemia, and 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. The observed mortality rate is unlikely related to renal failure since animals subjected to bilateral nephrectomy did not die within 48 hours after treatment with lipopolysaccharide. To further exclude the role of renal failure in the enhanced effect of endotoxemia, experiments were performed in which ischemic kidneys were excised from littermates and were placed in the abdomens of lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. A similar effect was observed: 50% of the animals died within 48 hours. Azotemia did not occur. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine involved in endotoxemia-induced morbidity and death, we studied the role of TNF in our model. Plasma levels of TNF were increased during endotoxemia. Concomitant renal ischemic injury did not influence the concentration of TNF. When animals were treated with recombinant TNF and were subsequently subjected to renal ischemic injury, again a 50% mortality was observed, a rate similar to that in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. We conclude that the sensitivity to endotoxemia is enhanced by tissue necrosis and may lead to death in the experimental model used in this study. 
5	Polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase during repair of duodenal mucosa after stress in rats. This investigation shows whether polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase have a role in duodenal mucosal repair following stress-induced microscopic damage. Rats were fasted for 22 hours, placed in restraint cages, and immersed in water to the xiphoid process for 6 hours. Animals were killed either immediately after the period of stress or at 2-hour intervals up to 24 hours thereafter. Duodenal mucosa was examined histologically, and ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine levels were measured. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased significantly up to 6 hours following stress, peaking at 4 hours at a level 10 times the prestress control. By 8 hours, enzyme activity had returned to near normal. Increases in mucosal putrescine, spermidine, and spermine content paralleled the changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and peaked 4 hours after stress. Stress resulted in microscopic damage evidenced by a nearly complete absence of villi. Significant macroscopic lesions were not present following stress. Mucosal repair was evident 12 hours after stress and almost complete by 24 hours, although the restituted villi were short and blunted. The decreases in mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein content caused by stress were restored and reached near-normal levels 12 hours after the period of stress. In animals given the specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, increases in duodenal mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels were inhibited and mucosal repair was almost completely prevented following stress. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine also prevented the recovery of DNA, RNA, and protein content of the duodenal mucosa. These results indicate that duodenal mucosal damage following stress is repaired rapidly; the repair process is accompanied by significant increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels; and the increases in ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines are absolutely required for the normal repair of the mucosa. 
5	The acute and insidious onset of pulmonary metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma is a common urologic neoplasm. Although pulmonary metastases from this tumor are often not appreciated clinically, they are frequently documented in autopsy studies. Therefore, the clinical recognition of this condition can be problematic. To illustrate this point, we present three patients with progressive unexplained dyspnea and histories of transitional cell carcinoma. Since ineffective and possibly detrimental therapeutic approaches may be initiated, a high index of suspicion for pulmonary metastatic embolization must be maintained. Early histologic identification of these metastatic emboli and initiation of effective chemotherapy may prove beneficial for improved quality of life. 
5	Suicide in twins. Suicide appears to cluster in families, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in this behavior. We studied 176 twin pairs in which one or both twins had committed suicide. Seven of the 62 monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for suicide compared with two of the 114 dizygotic twin pairs (11.3% vs 1.8%). The presence of psychiatric disorder in the twins and their families was examined in a subsample of 11 twin pairs, two of whom were concordant for suicide. Eleven of these 13 twin suicide victims had been treated for psychiatric disorder, as had eight of their nine surviving cotwins. In addition, twins in 10 pairs had other first- or second-degree relatives who had been treated for psychiatric disorder. Thus, these twin data suggest that genetic factors related to suicide may largely represent a genetic predisposition for the psychiatric disorders associated with suicide. However, they leave open the question of whether there may be an independent genetic component for suicide. 
5	Mean arterial blood pressure changes in premature infants and those at risk for intraventricular hemorrhage. Bedside microcomputer-derived, minute-to-minute mean arterial pressure (MAP) values during the first 48 hours of life were studied in 100 preterm babies with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 gm. In those babies (n = 72) with no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) or with grade 1 PV-IVH, the MAP values increased during the study period, with minute-to-minute variation and interval undulation. The MAP values in those with birth weight greater than 1000 gm were higher than in those of lower birth weight. Infants in whom grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH developed (n = 28) had consistently lower MAP values during the study period. Minute-to-minute variability, expressed as the average of the coefficients of variation at 15-minute intervals, did not differ between birth weight groups, nor did they differ between the PV-IVH group and their matched control subjects. However, those with PV-IVH spent a greater percentage of time, with a coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 13% or less than 3%, than their matched control subjects spent (p less than 0.005). This study provides reference data for MAP changes in premature babies. The observed MAP changes in those with PV-IVH lend support to a significant role for MAP alterations in the pathogenesis of PV-IVH. 
2	Preperitoneal herniorrhaphy for the acutely incarcerated groin hernia. Elective preperitoneal or posterior repair for recurrent groin hernias and primary femoral hernias has been shown to be a technically advantageous approach. In addition to the ease of inguinal floor and femoral canal assessment, scar tissue from prior anterior herniorrhaphy can be avoided. The emergency management of the acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernia of the groin using this approach has not been addressed. During a 30-month period, all patients with a diagnosis of acute incarceration of a groin hernia (n = 28) were surgically managed using either the anterior approach (AA) (n = 14) or the preperitoneal approach (PA) (n = 14). Two patients with strangulated intestine in the AA group required an additional midline incision for bowel evaluation and resection. Intestinal evaluation was easily accomplished through the same incision in four patients in the PA group. The preperitoneal approach also allowed proximal control of incarcerated or strangulated viscera, thus avoiding excessive manipulation of gangrenous or necrotic intestine, potential spillage of infected contents into the peritoneal cavity, and entry of bacteria, toxins, potassium, and the metabolic waste products of anaerobic metabolism into the systemic circulation during hernia reduction. There have been no recurrences in either group, and minor complications, such as wound infection and cellulitis, in the two groups are not statistically different. 
1	The genetics of retinoblastoma. Relevance to the patient. The understanding of the molecular biology of human cancer has advanced rapidly in the last decade, in part due to discoveries in the rare, pediatric ocular tumor, retinoblastoma. RB studies have led to recognition of a class of human genes, the tumor suppressor genes, that are critical in the initiation and progression of the malignant process. Mutations in the RB1 gene initiate RB and other specific tumors. They may also contribute to progressive stages of many other malignancies. The protein product of RB1 (p110RB1) is a basic regulator of the cell cycle. In the absence of normal protein, the cell proceeds to the next cell division without the potential to become quiescent. Understanding the genetics of RB has benefited the patients, as the precise identification of the RB1 mutations in families has led to accurate prediction of individuals at risk for RB tumors. It seems unlikely, in the foreseeable future, that direct genetic manipulation of mutant RB1 genes will play a role in therapy, but complete understanding of the function of p110RB1 may eventually allow exploitation of its powerful antiproliferative effect. Other molecular genetic events in addition to RB1 mutations are documented in RB tumors, and may play a critical role in the full malignant phenotype. The oncogene, N-myc, is amplified in some RB tumors and is expressed in normal fetal retina. The cytogenetic abnormality, i(6p), is almost unique to RB tumors. The molecular and tissue-specific roles of these abnormalities are not yet known. Many RB tumors also acquire excessive expression of the cell surface membrane glycoprotein, p170, linked to multidrug resistance, whether or not the RB tumor has been exposed to chemotherapy. We anticipate that ways to avoid or counteract the drug resistance of excessive p170 expression will be developed for other pediatric tumors and eventually will be applied to chemotherapy for RB patients. 
5	Electrocardiographic abnormalities in cerebrovascular accidents. The electrocardiographic abnormalities found in 100 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease and previously normal hearts are described. The abnormalities were more often seen in patients with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The most common changes were Q-Tc Prolongation and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. The mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities appear to be multiple. 
1	Who is being screened for melanoma/skin cancer? Characteristics of persons screened in Massachusetts. We conducted a survey of persons who voluntarily attended melanoma/skin cancer screenings in Massachusetts in 1987. Of 1219 persons asked to fill out a questionnaire, 1116 (92%) completed it. Our study demonstrates that persons attending the melanoma/skin cancer screening program were, for the most part, at risk for the disease and appropriately selected themselves to be screened. Most were women, well educated (with college or advanced degrees), and white. More than 86% had at least one risk factor for melanoma/skin cancer whereas 78% had at least two risk factors. Future studies are necessary to determine whether our experience can be verified. Additional efforts should try to attract those who are at risk but perhaps are less willing to attend screening programs--men and those of lower socioeconomic status. These efforts can help target screening to those at highest risk and maximize the yield of these public health efforts. 
4	A prospective randomized study of cerebrospinal fluid drainage to prevent paraplegia after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. This article is concerned with the study of the effect of several variables, principally that of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, on the incidence of neurologic deficit in a prospective randomized series of patients with extensive aneurysms of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (thoracoabdominal type I and II). Forty-six patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and 52 were controls, with a total of 98 available for study. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was continuously monitored in the former group and pressure maintained less than or equal to 10 mm Hg in 20, less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in 20, and greater than 15 mm Hg in 6 patients during period of aortic clamping. The method of treatment including reattachment of intercostal and lumbar arteries (p = 0.2), temporary atriofemoral bypass during aortic occlusion (p = 0.3), and spinal fluid drainage (p = 0.8) were not statistically significant in reducing the incidence of neurologic deficits. Thus cerebrospinal fluid drainage as we used it, was not beneficial in preventing paraplegia. On appropriate statistical analysis we found that the only significant predictor of delayed deficits was postoperative hypotension (p = 0.006). 
4	Coronary bypass grafting with totally calcified or acutely dissected ascending aorta. From August 1984 through November 1988, 10 of 2,658 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had ascending aortic disease that was not amenable to proximal anastomoses for coronary bypass grafting. This was due to a calcified aorta in 6 and acute aortic dissection in 4. There were 5 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 71 years. Cannulation site was the femoral artery in 5, ascending aorta in 3, and aortic arch in 2. Profound hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation, with no cross-clamp or cardioplegia, was used in 9 patients, and circulatory arrest in 1. In 8 patients a single internal mammary artery was used as the total inflow with a saphenous vein graft brought off the internal mammary artery to one or more distal left-sided coronary vessels. Bilateral internal mammary arteries were used in 2 other patients. Operative mortality was zero. There was one perioperative myocardial infarction and one transient stroke without sequelae. All patients have done well from 1 to 6 years postoperatively. These data support the use of internal mammary arteries as single or bilateral proximal conduits for other venoarterial bypass grafts when the aorta is extensively diseased either by calcification or dissection. 
1	Cardiac rhabdomyoma. Rare cause of fetal death. Two cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and fetal death associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma are reported. Case 1 presented with fetal supraventricular tachycardia, and cardiac rhabdomyoma was accurately diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. Autopsy revealed multiple rhabdomyomata involving the right atrial free wall, the sinoatrial node, and the left ventricle. The left circumflex coronary artery was extrinsically compressed by adjacent tumor tissue, causing left ventricular myocardial infarction. Case 2 had a unique, pedunculated, ball-like rhabdomyoma that almost totally occluded the mitral orifice. The causes of fetal death in patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma are analyzed and the possibility of fetal surgical management is proposed. 
4	Popliteal vascular trauma. A community experience. Preventing amputation continues to be a significant challenge when popliteal vascular injuries occur. A retrospective review of cases from the San Diego County (California) Trauma System identified 108 patients with 76 blunt and 32 penetrating arterial injuries. The limb preservation rate was 88%; there were 13 amputations. The fracture-dislocated knee injury and close-range shotgun blasts were particularly limb threatening. In general, the trauma system achieved rapid evaluation of injuries and early operative intervention. All 13 patients who underwent amputations presented with signs of severe ischemia. Concomitant injuries to the popliteal vein, tibial nerves, and soft tissue were significantly more frequent in patients who underwent amputations. The importance of complete fasciotomy for compartment hypertension, early reconstructive management of soft-tissue injuries, and expeditious arterial repair, frequently without preoperative roentgenographic suite arteriography, is emphasized. An aggressive, multidisciplinary approach is required to achieve a functional extremity when popliteal vascular trauma occurs. 
4	Reduced atrial contribution to left ventricular filling in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid valvulectomy: a Doppler echocardiographic study. Patients undergoing valvulectomy for isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis offer the unique opportunity to study the effects of acquired right ventricular volume overload on left ventricular filling in persons free of pulmonary hypertension and preexisting left heart disease. Eleven patients who had undergone total or partial removal of the tricuspid valve were compared with 11 age-matched control subjects; Doppler echocardiographic techniques were used to quantify changes in left ventricular filling and to relate them to changes in left ventricular and left atrial geometry caused by right ventricular and right atrial distension. The late diastolic fractional transmitral flow velocity integral, a measure of the left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, was significantly decreased in patients undergoing tricuspid valvulectomy compared with control subjects (0.22 +/- 0.11 versus 0.32 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.04). Severe tricuspid regurgitation in these patients resulted in marked right atrial distension, reversal of the normal interatrial septal curvature and compression of the left atrium such that left atrial area was significantly smaller than in control subjects (5.9 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 cm2/m2; p less than 0.005). Acting as a receiving chamber, the left ventricle was maximally compressed by the volume-overloaded right ventricle in late diastole, coincident with the timing of atrial systole, resulting in a significant increase in the left ventricular eccentricity index compared with that in control subjects (1.35 +/- 0.14 versus 1.03 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). Thus, right ventricular volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation results in left heart geometric alterations that decrease left atrial preload, impair left ventricular receiving chamber characteristics and reduce the atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling. 
1	Identification of transforming growth factor beta family members present in bone-inductive protein purified from bovine bone. Characterization of the polypeptides present in bone-inductive protein extracts from bovine bone has led to the cloning of seven regulatory molecules, six of which are distantly related to transforming growth factor beta. The three human bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) we describe herein, BMP-5, BMP-6, and BMP-7, show extensive sequence similarity to BMP-2, a molecule that by itself is sufficient to induce de novo bone formation in vivo. The additive or synergistic contribution of these BMP-2-related molecules to the osteogenic activity associated with demineralized bone is strongly implicated by the presence of these growth factors in the most active fractions of highly purified bone extract. 
3	Panic disorder in seizure patients: a diagnostic pitfall. Panic disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis whose main feature is paroxysmal attacks of anxiety that strike suddenly without apparent provocation. Physicians explain the attacks as an ictal phenomenon in patients with known seizures because of their similarities to complex partial seizures. We report eight patients with seizures and panic disorder. Recognition of a second diagnostic entity resulted in a beneficial change in treatment in six of the eight. We did not find an increased incidence of panic disorder in our seizure clinic population as compared with the general population. 
5	Anterior perforations in lumbar discectomies. A report of four cases of vascular complications and a CT study of the prevertebral lumbar anatomy. Four cases of vascular complications to anterior perforations during discectomy prompted a CT study to measure lumbar disc diameters and to evaluate the prevertebral anatomy. Fifty young adults who had been referred for low-back pain and/or sciatica but had not undergone operation were included. In five additional patients, prone versus supine CT examinations were compared. Six typical configurations of the vascular anatomy could be classified to explain the type of vascular complications occurring at the L3-4 and L4-L5 disc levels. The sagittal diameter of the three lowest lumbar discs varied from 33 to 56 mm, indicating the importance of this parameter as an intraoperative guideline for the spine surgeon. Air-filled intestines were observed anterior to the L5-S1 disc predominantly in the prone position. The possible relationship between this finding and postoperative discitis is discussed. 
5	A syndrome characterized by nodular eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and immunoglobulin isotype imbalance. A 9-year-old boy had recurrent acute, plaquelike, nodular infiltrations with overlying vesicles and bullae of the face and right hand. Histologically, the lesions consisted of a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils. The lesions responded to dapsone therapy. Laboratory studies revealed blood eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemias E and G4, and hypoimmunoglobulinemias M and G1-3, which normalized after treatment. The patient's immune deviation is consistent with a transient imbalance of lymphokine production in helper T cells. 
3	Continuous removal of middle molecules by hemofiltration in patients with acute liver failure. In patients with acute liver failure and hepatic coma, an increase in the abnormal "middle molecules" seen on the chromatograms of the sera is suspected of playing an etiologic role in the coma. A pilot study of continuous hemofiltration using a high-performance membrane was conducted in 16 such patients in an attempt to decrease the serum levels of the middle molecules. The procedure was used alternately with plasma exchange. High-performance liquid chromatography showed a notable removal of the substances in the filtrates and a sequential removal from the serum by hemofiltration. Eight (50%) of the 16 patients had amelioration in level of consciousness and were weaned successfully from hemofiltration. Although only three of the 16 patients survived the acute illness, 13 others lived an average of 15 days and five patients survived greater than 3 wk. While the continuous removal of middle molecules from the serum may not reverse liver failure, this procedure used in conjunction with plasma exchange may provide a means of life support, e.g., for patients awaiting a liver transplant. 
1	Pleuroperitoneal shunting for intractable pleural effusions. Pleuroperitoneal shunts were implanted in 17 patients with intractable pleural effusions, 15 of which were malignant and 2 benign. Complicating factors included 13 instances of severe trapped lung and 3 cases of synchronous ascites. There was one hospital death. Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion. Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement. Two of these were replaced. The remaining conduits continued to function to the present or until the patients' deaths between 1 and 28 months. Shunting allowed hospital discharge and provided symptomatic relief in a group of patients in whom other approaches had failed or were not applicable. 
2	Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. 
1	The epidemiology of ophthalmic malignancies in New York State. The epidemiologic characteristics of more than 1400 primary eye cancers (ICD-9, site 190) diagnosed among New York State (NYS) residents between 1975 and 1986 are described. Among NYS male residents, the average annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 7.5 per 1,000,000, and among NYS female residents, the rate was 5.4 per 1,000,000 (male:female rate ratio, 1.39). The majority of ophthalmic malignancies were included within three histologic groupings: melanomas (70.4%), retinoblastomas (9.8%), and squamous cell carcinomas (9.2%). The average annual incidence of retinoblastoma among persons in NYS who were less than 5 years of age was 9.5 per 1,000,000 for boys and 8.7 per 1,000,000 for girls (male:female rate ratio, 1.09). The average annual incidence (age-adjusted) of ocular melanomas was 4.9 per 1,000,000 among men and 3.7 per 1,000,000 among women in NYS (male:female rate ratio, 1.32). Expanded knowledge of the epidemiology of ophthalmic cancers can help to develop a foundation on which to monitor disease patterns and can serve to stimulate further etiologic research involving these rare malignancies. 
3	Chronic pain in primary care. Identification and management of psychosocial factors. Chronic pain is a problem of great public health importance that is frequently seen in the primary care setting. Pain chronicity shows a strong association with psychosocial factors. Assessment of these factors should be composed of two parts: (1) psychological factors and (2) psychiatric illness. Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort. Usually these interventions can be accomplished by the family physician in concert with a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist. In severely disabled or resistant patients, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic will be necessary. 
4	Surgical resection of intrinsic brain stem lesions: an overview. A major limitation to the effective treatment of intrinsic mass lesions of the brain stem has been the inability to clearly define the pathological anatomy radiographically. The improved soft tissue resolution offered by magnetic resonance imaging, as compared with axial computed tomography, now makes it possible not only to accurately distinguish anatomical relationships, but also to predict the pathological nature of the lesion. Accordingly, we have been encouraged to pursue a more aggressive approach to intrinsic lesions of the brain stem that appear well circumscribed on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The object of this paper is to report the successful treatment of four intrinsic lesions of the brain stem and to present an overview of the relevant published experience. 
1	Immunohistochemical studies on the main entrance-route of CA19-9 into the peripheral venous blood of gastric cancer patients. Correlation with CA19-9 levels in peripheral and portal blood. The correlation between CA19-9 levels of portal and peripheral venous blood, and immunohistochemical variables of cancer lesions was examined in 53 gastric cancer patients and eight patients with benign diseases. Immunohistochemically, CA19-9 was found in 33 (62.5%) of 53 primary lesions. The antigen was found in the cancer cells of invasive lymphatics and node metastases of every CA19-9 localized cancer, although the cancer cells in veins showed little or no CA19-9. There was little or no antigen in the cancer cells in veins, lymphatics, or metastases of 20 CA19-9 nonlocalized primary lesions. Patients with CA19-9 nonlocalized cancer or with benign diseases showed no elevation of the antigen levels in peripheral or portal blood. CA19-9 levels of portal blood (mean, 76.4 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%) were not different from those of peripheral blood (mean, 91.5 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%). Additionally, the antigen levels of the blood in patients with lymphatic invasion or node metastases were significantly higher than those in patients without the invasion or the metastases, and every patient without the invasion showed no elevation of the antigen. These results suggest that production of the antigen in cancer cells may be a premise of CA19-9 elevation in peripheral blood and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system via node metastases or invasive lymphatics, but not by the hematogenous portal system. 
2	The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease. 
5	Expression of X protein and hepatitis B virus replication in chronic hepatitis. The X protein can act on the enhancer of hepatitis B virus in an in vitro system and elevate the transcriptional level of hepatitis B virus. However, because no relationship had been reported between X protein expression and hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic hepatitis B, we focused on its expression in the liver in comparison with markers of hepatitis B virus replication. Liver biopsy samples and sera from 59 carriers with HBsAg were examined immunohistochemically for X protein using rabbit IgG against recombinant X protein. There was a significant difference in the serum hepatitis B virus DNA level between X protein-positive and -negative patients (p less than 0.001). Serum pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens were also measured quantitatively by enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies specific against each antigen. The titers of pre-S1 antigen in patients positive for X protein were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the X protein-negative patients (3.02 +/- 0.99 vs. 2.00 +/- 0.59, respectively). Similarly, the titers of pre-S2 antigen were 2.98 +/- 0.91 vs. 1.94 +/- 0.54, respectively (p less than 0.001). The rate of positivity of the X protein was higher (38 of 49; 77.6%) in the replicative group (serum HBeAg, serum hepatitis B virus DNA or HBcAg in liver positive) compared with that observed in the nonreplicative group (3 of 10; 30%--serum HBeAg, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBcAg in liver negative) (p less than 0.01). 
3	Effect of ethanol on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. The effect of ethanol ingestion on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) as a treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome was studied in ten obese male subjects undergoing this therapy. On the first night of polysomnography, the lowest level of CPAP that maintained airway patency was determined (critical level). On the second (control) night (C), subjects slept the entire night on this level of CPAP. On the third night (E), subjects ingested either 1.5 ml/kg (part A, N = 6) or 2.0 ml/kg (part B, N = 4) of 50 percent ethanol (100 proof vodka) over one half-hour starting 1 h before bedtime. A serum ethanol level was obtained at bedtime (part A: 63.7 +/- 17.3 mg/dl; part B: 108.6 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and subjects were monitored on the critical level of CPAP. Comparison of nights C and E for parts A + B showed no difference in total sleep time (TST) or the amount of different sleep stages as an absolute time or a percentage of TST except that there was more stage 2 (as a percent of TST) on E nights. The apnea + hypopnea index and C and E nights did not differ and was quite low (3.6 +/- 3.7/h vs 1.9 +/- 2.7/h). Similarly, ethanol ingestion did not increase the number of desaturations to at or below 90 and 85 percent, or lower the mean arterial oxygen saturation in NREM or REM sleep. Analysis of parts A and B separately also showed no differences with respect to the apnea + hypopnea index or the number of desaturations on control and ethanol nights. We conclude that acute moderate ethanol ingestion does not decrease the efficacy of an optimum level of nasal CPAP. 
5	Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. 
3	Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography: clinical applications in cerebrovascular disease. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was introduced in 1982 as a noninvasive procedure for assessment of the intracranial cerebral circulation. The lightweight and portable equipment used for transcranial Doppler examination facilitates its use in the bedside assessment of critically ill hospitalized patients and outpatients. Clinical applications include the diagnosis of vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, assessment of intracranial collateral flow in patients with extracranial arterial occlusive disease, detection of intracranial arterial stenosis, identification of the feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformations and monitoring the hemodynamic effects of their treatment, confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death, intensive-care unit monitoring of brain-injured patients, and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of neurosurgical patients. Transcranial Doppler technology is also providing new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of a variety of cerebrovascular conditions. Clinicians will find transcranial Doppler technology most helpful if they have a specific question about the status of the intracranial circulation. Further investigations may expand the clinical and research utility of this technology. 
2	Outpatient health care utilization of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. On the basis of the normal life expectancy of inflammatory bowel disease patients, the early onset of their disease, and the variety of symptoms, inflammatory bowel disease patients were anticipated to be frequent users of outpatients services. This study assesses (1) the characteristics, (2) outpatient health care utilization, and (3) the degree of satisfaction with health care of inflammatory bowel disease patients compared to patients with other gastrointestinal disease. The study method was a secondary analysis of data collected on 395 patients attending the University of Calgary Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic in 1988. Inflammatory bowel disease patients were significantly younger (P less than 0.001) and better educated (P less than 0.05) than other patients. During the past year inflammatory bowel disease patients consulted significantly more often with their gastroenterologist (P less than 0.001) and spent more time in hospital (P less than 0.05) than other patients. Inflammatory bowel disease patients also consulted more frequently with herbalists and naturopaths. Lastly, inflammatory bowel disease patients were as satisfied with the health care they received as other patients. These results provide information useful for health care planners as well as for those dealing directly with inflammatory bowel disease patients. 
5	Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results. We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy. The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported. This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction. The surgical complications were acceptable. Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time. After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm. water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc). All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits. Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra. The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy. 
1	Relationship between histologic features, DNA flow cytometry, and clinical behavior of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was done on 133 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Overall, 76 tumors (57.1%) were not diploid (aneuploid or tetraploid). The DNA index (DI) was calculated and grouped into three levels. Fifty-seven cases had a DI in a range of 1.85 to 2.15 (44 diploid and 13 tetraploid). The cases were grouped in relation to ploidy, proliferative index, and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Every group was analyzed with respect to survival rate. Ploidy was related to histocytologic grade. In well-differentiated tumors (G1) survival rates at 48 months were 41.7% in diploid cases and 27.7% in nondiploid ones (relative risk [RR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89, 4.52). In NO cases that underwent surgery, survival rates at 48 months were, respectively, 81.8% and 49.2% (RR, 5.07; 95% CI, 0.76, 33.93). These results suggest that ploidy may be a new independent parameter of prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. This is useful in clinical practice because it allows the clinician to recognize those cases with poorer prognosis among the early tumors at a stage where other prognostic parameters are not yet available. 
1	Automated immunohistochemical estrogen receptor in fixed embedded breast carcinomas. The authors immunohistochemically assessed the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 68 breast carcinomas by an automated method using Pronase (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) predigestion and alkaline phosphatase detection (Method 1). These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2), with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3), and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay). Compared with the DCC assay, Methods 1, 2, and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%, 25%, and 89%, respectively. The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive. A negative result, especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive, may indicate no receptors, receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein, or improper tissue preservation. In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining, and with an understanding of its limitations, this method may be useful. 
4	Interventricular coronary steal induced by stenosis of left anterior descending coronary artery in exercising pigs. BACKGROUND. In pigs and humans, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) supplies the left ventricular anterior wall (LVAW), anterior septum, and paraseptal band of the right ventricular anterior wall (RVAW). The purposes of our study were 1) to study the LAD flow distribution in these walls during preexercise, exercise, and exercise with LAD stenosis and 2) to analyze regional wall motion under these conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Nine pigs were instrumented with sonomicrometers for measuring percent wall thickening (%WTh) in LVAW, RVAW, and lateral (control) walls of both ventricles, a hydraulic occluder at the LAD origin, an LV pressure transducer, and catheters for radioactive microsphere injection (left atrium) and blood withdrawal (aorta). One month later, regional %WTh and flows were measured during preexercise, exercise, and continuing exercise with LAD stenosis resulting in more than 50% reduction in systolic LVAW %WTh with regard to exercise. LAD stenosis caused a dramatic decrease in total mean +/- SD LVAW subendocardial flow with regard to exercise (28.7 +/- 8 to 9.1 +/- 3.2 ml.min-1, p less than 0.0001) but not significant changes in either LVAW subepicardial flow or RVAW flow. The transmural distribution of flows within the LAD bed (as percentages of the total LAD flow in each experimental condition) showed that LAD stenosis redistributed flows with regard to exercise such that the LVAW subendocardial flow decreased from 26.4 +/- 4.2% of the total LAD flow to 11.8 +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.0001), whereas LVAW subepicardial flow increased from 32.9 +/- 2.3% of the total LAD flow to 45.5 +/- 7.9% (p less than 0.0001) and RVAW increased from 12 +/- 4.9% of the total LAD flow to 18.7 +/- 7.2% (p less than 0.0005). With exercise plus LAD stenosis, LVAW %WTh decreased from 43.2 +/- 8.4% to 17.2 +/- 9.7% (p less than 0.0001), but RVAW %WTh did not change. CONCLUSIONS. In the LAD bed of exercising pigs, LAD stenosis induces, in addition to transmural steal, an interventricular steal favoring the RVAW at the expense of the LVAW subendocardium. This steal results in preserved RVAW thickening despite severe LVAW hypokinesia. 
5	Omeprazole 20 mg three days a week and 10 mg daily in prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse. Double-blind comparative trial. In a double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial of 195 patients with duodenal ulcers who after a short-term study had relief of pain and healed ulcers proved endoscopically, 65 were randomized to receive 20 mg omeprazole 3 days a week (once in the morning from Friday to Sunday), 64 to receive 10 mg omeprazole once daily in the morning, and 66 to receive placebo for up to 6 months. The patients underwent repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric fundic mucosa (qualitative assessment of argyrophilic cell population), assessment of symptoms, and laboratory screening with measurement of basal serum gastrin concentrations at 3 and 6 months or more often if indicated by recurrence of symptoms. At 3 months, endoscopically proved ulcer relapse occurred in 16% receiving 20 mg omeprazole 3 days a week; 21% receiving 10 mg omeprazole daily; and 50% receiving placebo. At 6 months, corresponding rates were 23%, 27%, and 67% with 95% confidence intervals of difference between the placebo group and omeprazole groups of 28%-60% and 24%-56% (P less than 0.00001), respectively, and between omeprazole groups of -19%-11% (NS). No major clinical or laboratory side effects were noted. Thus both omeprazole regimens are effective and safe in preventing duodenal ulcer relapse. 
1	Neoadjuvant Cis-DDP in esophageal cancers: an experience at a regional cancer centre, India. We are analysing the results of 80 patients who underwent surgery during 1983-84 for esophageal cancer. Forty patients who received pre-operative single agent Cis-DDP were grouped under "A" and 40 patients who went for surgery directly were grouped under "B". Twenty-two patients (55%) of Group A showed tumor necrosis. Both groups underwent resection and hand-sewn anastamosis of the esophagus. There were 10 post-operative deaths among 80 resected cases, 9 of them being from anastomatic leak. Cis-DDP has induced negligible side effects. A comparatively high survival rate during early years in patients who responded to Cis-DDP suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be of value. 
2	Brush cytology in the diagnosis of colonic neoplasms. During a three-year period (1986-1988), 234 colonic brush specimens were received in the authors' laboratory. Nine samples (4%) were deemed unsatisfactory for evaluation because of inadequate cellularity and/or poor fixation. In 11 cases concomitant or follow-up histologic specimens were not available. The remaining 214 specimens included 82 malignant neoplasms, 88 neoplastic polyps (adenomas), and 44 nonneoplastic lesions. Sixty-seven (82%) of malignant neoplasms were correctly diagnosed by brush cytology. Three cases of adenoma with severe dysplasia or in situ carcinoma were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by cytology. No false-positive diagnoses were made of nonneoplastic lesions. Brush cytology was found to be a more sensitive technique in the diagnosis of colon cancer than endoscopic biopsy (82% and 74% sensitivity, respectively). The combination of the two techniques increased the sensitivity to 90% and improved the overall accuracy of the test. Seventy-one (82%) of the colonic adenomas were correctly diagnosed by cytology. Brush cytology is a convenient, safe, and accurate technique which should be used concurrently with endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy. 
5	Freezing lesions of the developing rat brain: a model for cerebrocortical microgyria. Cerebrocortical microgyri were induced by placing a freezing probe on the skull of P0 and P1 rat pups. Freezing lesions resulted in laminar necrosis of the infragranular layers and the subsequent migration of supragranular neurons through the region of damage. The result was most often a region of four-layered microgyric cortex consisting of a molecular layer, a thickened layer ii, a lamina dissecans (corresponding to the necrotized layers IV, V, and VIa), and a neuronal layer iv which corresponded to layer VIb of the intact cortex. Immunocytochemical investigation of the microgyric cortex with antibodies to neurofilament, glial fibrillary acidic protein and glutamate showed more widespread disruption of neocortical architecture than could be seen from Nissl preparations. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neuronal bodies appeared to be distributed normally in the microgyric region although their processes were sometimes distorted. These results are considered in the light of previous research on induced microgyria, and possible implications for the behavioral consequences of focal, developmental neuropathologic lesions are discussed. 
5	Pharyngeal shape and dimensions in healthy subjects, snorers, and patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. To characterise the relation between pharyngeal anatomy and sleep related disordered breathing, 17 men with complaints of snoring were studied by all night polysomnography. Ten of them had obstructive sleep apnoea (mean (SD) apnoea-hypopnoea index 56.3 (41.7), age 52 (10) years, body mass index 31.4 (5.3) kg/m2); whereas seven were simple snorers (apnoea-hypopnoea index 6.7 (4.6), age 40 (17) years, body mass index 25.9 (4.3) kg/m2). The pharynx was studied by magnetic resonance imaging in all patients and in a group of eight healthy subjects (age 27 (6) years, body mass index 21.8 (2.2) kg/m2, both significantly lower than in the patients; p less than 0.05). On the midsagittal section and six transverse sections equally spaced between the nasopharynx and the hypopharynx several anatomical measurements were performed. Results showed that there was no difference between groups in most magnetic resonance imaging measurements, but that on transverse sections the pharyngeal cross section had an elliptic shape with the long axis oriented in the coronal plane in normal subjects, whereas in apnoeic and snoring patients the pharynx was circular or had an elliptic shape but with the long axis oriented in the sagittal plane. It is suggested that the change in pharyngeal cross sectional shape, secondary to a reduction in pharyngeal transverse diameter, may be related to the risk of developing sleep related disordered breathing. 
5	Typhlitis due to Balantidium coli in captive lowland gorillas. Typhlitis caused by Balantidium coli and requiring surgical resection occurred in three captive lowland gorillas over a 30-month period. Not one of the other gorillas in the colony or their keepers was ill. B. coli is distributed widely geographically and widely among mammals. Asymptomatic commensalism predominates, but invasion of the colonic mucosa can produce diarrhea and dysentery and set the stage for local or systemic spread. 
5	Open reduction and fixation of proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations. Open reduction and internal fixation was employed in the treatment of 25 severely displaced fractures and fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus. Our aims were accurate reduction and stable fixation to allow early mobilisation and to achieve full functional recovery. In 15 fractures an AO T-plate was used and in 10 a bent semitubular plate was employed as a blade plate. Excellent or satisfactory results were obtained in all six patients with two-part fractures involving the surgical neck; in four of the five patients with three-part fractures involving the surgical neck and tuberosities; in nine of the 11 patients with fracture-dislocation; and in two of the three patients with split fractures of the humeral head. Overall results were good or satisfactory in 21 of the 25 cases. Unsatisfactory results were associated with rotator cuff damage. 
2	Castor bean intoxication. We report the cases of a child who ingested two or more castor beans and two adults who each ingested four beans. All three patients developed severe gastroenteritis and recovered without sequelae after receiving IV fluids. The literature contains reports of 424 cases of castor bean intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication include acute gastroenteritis, fluid and electrolyte depletion, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, and hypoglycemia. Delayed cytotoxicity has not been reported. Of the 424 patients, 14 died (mortality rates: 8.1% of untreated and 0.4% of treated). Deaths were due to hypovolemic shock. Recommended treatment for asymptomatic patients who have chewed one or more raw beans is emergency department evaluation, gastric decontamination, administration of activated charcoal, observation until four to six hours after ingestion, and discharge instructions to return if symptoms develop. After decontamination and activated charcoal, symptomatic patients require hospitalization for treatment with IV fluids, supportive care, and monitoring for hypoglycemia, hemolysis, and complications of hypovolemia. Monitoring for delayed cytotoxicity is unnecessary. Castor beans and their dust are highly allergenic and may cause anaphylaxis. 
5	Repetitive intraoperative mapping and cryotherapy improve the results of endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia. Patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or a history of a sudden cardiac death episode and ventricular tachycardia inducible in the electrophysiology laboratory have a high incidence of recurrence and a high mortality despite medical therapy. Map-guided endocardial resection has improved treatment results, but is associated with a 10-30% failure rate. In our initial experience with endocardial resection (Group I) we incurred a 30% treatment failure rate. In the present study we have found the addition of sequential intraoperative mapping and routine use of cryotherapy (Group II) improved our results of ventricular tachycardia control without significant additional morbidity or mortality. 
2	Increasing prevalence of gallstones in male veterans with alcoholic cirrhosis. Cases of alcoholic cirrhosis identified at necropsy were studied for the prevalence and type of gallstones, compared with age- and race-matched autopsy controls. Data were examined from 1970-1977 and 1980-1987. In the early sample of 460 cirrhotic patients, 33% had gallstone disease, contrasted with 12% in the controls. In the 1980s, among 299 patients, 46% had gallstone disease, whereas it was present in 13% of the controls. The prevalence of stones was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls for both time periods and, among the patients, was significantly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s (p less than 0.05). A comparison of cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones indicated a significantly higher incidence of ascites in the patients with gallstones. The gallstones in cirrhotics were more frequently pigmented than in the controls in both time periods. In 100 living patients with advanced cirrhosis studied by sonography during 1987 and 1989, the prevalence of gallstones was 43%, almost the same as the autopsy sample from 1980-1987. In these cirrhotics, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices were more prevalent in the patients with stones than those without. We conclude that pigmented gallstones are increasing in cirrhosis of the liver related to the severity of the liver disease. 
5	Congenital dilatation of the bile duct in 100 instances and its relationship with anomalous junction [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Mar;172(3):246] Congenital dilatation of the bile duct (CDBD) or choledochal cyst has been demonstrated to be associated with an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Multifarious clinical signs and symptoms of CDBD have been shown to be closely related with the presence of this anomalous junction. In the present study, 100 instances of CDBD treated surgically at our institutions during a 30 year period were classified into two types according to the morphologic features of dilatation of the bile duct; there were 77 instances of the cystic type and 23 of the cylindric type. Morphologic features of the lesion, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings in these 100 instances were clinically analyzed. In almost all of the patients who were less than one year of age, the disease was of the cystic type and patients presented with either a palpable mass or jaundice as the main symptom. In patients more than one year of age, the disease was of either the cystic or cylindric type. A history of episodes of characteristic abdominal pain accompanied by elevated levels of serum amylase was present in 70 of the patients with the cystic type of disease and in all of the patients with the cylindric type. Histologic sections from the patients showed glandular formation with chronic inflammation, possibly a result of refluxed activated pancreatic juice; in contrast, histologic sections from the remaining patients of all ages showed only thickening of the fibrous layer. Thus, such variable morphologic features and clinical signs and symptoms in CDBD are highly dependent on two factors--the age at onset and the reflux of pancreatic juice into the bile duct through the common channel. 
5	Striatonigral degeneration. A clinicopathological study. The clinical and pathological features of 10 cases of striatonigral degeneration are described: 5 were misdiagnosed in life as Parkinson's disease. Retrospectively, helpful early pointers to the diagnosis in these cases included unexplained falls, autonomic dysfunction, absence of rest tremor and failure to respond to L-dopa, but these were not always present. The pathological diagnosis could not be excluded on macroscopic examination of the striatum. Relative preservation of the putamen occurred in the 4 patients who benefited from L-dopa. The caudate nucleus was involved in all cases and there was no sparing of the large striatal neurons. In mild cases, involvement of the putamen was confined to its posterior two-thirds, dorsolaterally. With increasing severity this extended in a dorsal to ventral and posterior to anterior direction. Seven of the cases had evidence of olivopontocerebellar damage, but only 2 of these had clinical evidence of cerebellar disease. Correlation was found between the neuronal counts in caudate:putamen, striatum:nigra compacta, globus pallidus:nigra compacta, nigra compacta:locus coeruleus. The most severely involved part of the substantia nigra pars compacta was the ventrolateral zone, which projects to the dorsal putamen, the earliest site of striatal disease. 
2	Gastric emptying in infants and children: limited utility of 1-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements were performed in infants and children at 1 and 2 hours after a liquid feeding. The 1-hour measurements were predictive of only 58% of the variability in the 2-hour measurements, indicating that the 1-hour measurement was not a good predictor of the 2-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements in children should be continued until 2 hours after feeding unless rapid emptying is observed during the 1st hour of the study. 
5	Anxiety and depression in patients with chronic urticaria and generalized pruritus. Thirty-four dermatology out-patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and 34 with idiopathic generalized pruritus were investigated using standardized self-assessment psychological questionnaires to determine the incidence of significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. These patients were compared with age- and sex-matched but otherwise unselected general dermatology out-patients. Using the Beck depression inventory, significantly more patients with generalized pruritus (32.4%) had depressive symptomatology (score greater than 14) than controls (13.2%, P less than 0.05). Although more patients with chronic urticaria had depressive symptomatology (14.7%) than controls (4.4%), the difference was not statistically significant. Using the Speilberger state-trait anxiety inventory there were no significant differences between the patients with pruritus or urticaria and their controls with respect to state or trait anxiety scores above the upper 90% probability limit for the general population. Thus, significant depression may be expected in a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic generalized pruritus but in a relatively small proportion of those with chronic urticaria. 
1	Fungal brain abscesses (aspergillosis/mucormycosis) in two immunosuppressed patients. Although the mortality rate for fungal brain abscesses in immunosuppressed patients remains unacceptably high, this figure may be reduced if computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed more promptly in susceptible individuals with seemingly mild intracranial complaints. Earlier presumptive amphotericin B treatment and more timely surgical debridement may minimize neurological injury and enhance survival. These assumptions were only tentatively supported by the clinical courses of two patients, one an alert patient with promyelocytic leukemia and an aspergillosis brain abscess who survived, and the other, a comatose intravenous drug abuser with mucormycosis who died. 
5	The VER as a diagnostic marker for childhood abdominal migraine. Abdominal migraine is a common childhood migraine equivalent, for which diagnostic criteria have not been defined. As in other children with migraine equivalents this leads to difficulties in diagnosis and determination of prevalence. By recording the fast wave activity (beta rhythmn) in the visual evoked response (VER) to red and white flash, the pattern stimulation, 27 out of 28 children with clinically diagnosed abdominal migraine revealed significant differences compared with normal controls, outside the attack phase. Comparisons with children diagnosed as migraine with or without aura revealed, from the VER findings of higher amplitude fast wave activity and the presence of paroxysmal sharp wave activity, that abdominal migraine appears to be a specific form of childhood migraine. We found that both clinically and electrophysiologically, abdominal migraine changes with age; older children exhibiting a shorter duration of abdominal pain during attacks, and less evidence of sharp wave activity in the VER. 
1	The use of molecular probes to distinguish new primary tumors from recurrent tumors in gynecologic malignancies. This is the first report using DNA molecular probe technology to distinguish between recurrent tumor and a second primary malignancy in a patient. Tumor DNA was extracted from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix at the time of radical hysterectomy. Eighteen months later a squamous cell cancer was found in a vaginal apex biopsy from which DNA was extracted. Tumor DNA from both lesions was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and DNA molecular hybridization with human papillomavirus (HPV) probes. Although both lesions were positive for HPV 16, their respective restriction enzyme patterns had different HPV genetic arrangements, thereby demonstrating their distinctness. 
5	Preoperative superselective arteriolar embolization: a new approach to enhance resectability of spinal tumors. The extent of surgical resection of spinal tumors is frequently limited by blood loss and technical difficulty associated with the vascularity of the tumors. We report here the use of superselective percutaneous arterial embolization to reduce the rate of blood loss at the time of surgical resection and enhance resectability. The types of tumors treated were metastatic renal carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Two of the patients required repeated embolization and surgery for recurrent symptoms. The estimated blood loss in seven of nine procedures performed on the six patients ranged from 300 to 800 ml, after which no transfusion was required. In two procedures, extensive resection of very large tumors resulted in larger losses of blood, and postoperative transfusion was necessary. No significant complications of embolization or surgery occurred. A key factor in our embolization technique is the use of microfibrillar collagen, which allows occlusion of tumor vessels as small as 20 microns and may prevent reconstitution of the embolized vessels by collateral flow. We conclude that preoperative arterial embolization enhances the resectability of a variety of spinal tumors by reducing intraoperative blood loss. This may provide an additional benefit by reducing the risk related to postoperative transfusion. By permitting a more aggressive surgical approach, the use of preoperative embolization also has the potential to improve outcome in patients with spinal tumors. 
1	Surgical approach to the retrocrural lymph nodes. Removal of retrocrural lymph nodes requires an approach other than the infradiaphragmatic retroperitoneal access generally used in the surgical management of testicular tumours. The transperitoneal route given access, at best, to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, but advanced testicular tumours occasionally require retrocrural node dissection. We describe a useful surgical approach to these nodes and the underlying anatomy. 
3	Fulminant hepatitis B: induction by hepatitis B virus mutants defective in the precore region and incapable of encoding e antigen. Clones of hepatitis B virus were propagated from 10 cases of fulminant hepatitis B after amplification by polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences of the precore region were determined. All 113 clones from 9 cases had a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) and prohibited the synthesis and secretion of hepatitis B e antigen. Precore-region defects were not detected in any of 23 clones from the remaining 1 case. By contrast, precore-region defects were not found in any of 180 clones from 8 cases of acute hepatitis B without hepatic failure serving as controls. The source of infection was traceable in 3 cases. The same precore-region defect, along with the sequence identity of 435 nucleotides, was observed in clones from the case of a baby and his grandmother, who carried the virus and was implicated in the transmission, and also in clones from two pediatricians and the carrier patients they attended. These findings support the hypothesis that precore-defective mutants have stronger activity to induce fulminant hepatitis than nondefective viruses. 
2	Abnormal cardiac sensitivity in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries. The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain. The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown. 
5	Follow-up status of patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and panic disorder. Cardiology patients with normal coronary angiography demonstrate continuing and substantial social, health, and work disability. We hypothesized that the diagnosis of panic disorder would mark those for whom continuing disability is most likely. We interviewed 72 such patients at the time of their normal angiogram, and then again an average of 38 months later. Those with panic disorder (n = 36) demonstrated significantly more disability at follow-up than did the other study patients. We conclude that those patients with normal angiograms who have panic disorder are more disabled than those who do not have panic disorder. Panic disorder in psychiatric samples has been shown to be highly treatable. Therefore, early identification and treatment of panic disorder in this group is likely to minimize the suffering associated with this condition. 
5	Cofactors in male-female sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In a study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-uninfected African prostitutes, 83 (67%) of 124 seroconverted to HIV-1. Oral contraceptive use (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-8.6; P less than .03), genital ulcers (mean annual episodes, 1.32 +/- 0.55 in seroconverting women vs. 0.48 +/- 0.21 in seronegative women; P less than .02) and Chlamydia trachomatis infections (OR, 3.6; CI, 1.3-11.0; P less than .02) were associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection. Condom use reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection (OR, 0.11; CI, 0.05-0.27; P less than .0001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed independent associations between HIV-1 infection and oral contraceptive use, condom use, genital ulcers, and C. trachomatis. The presence of other sexually transmitted diseases may in part explain the heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic in Africa and may represent important targets for intervention to control HIV-1 infection. 
1	Effective ultraviolet irradiation of platelet concentrates in teflon bags. Several plastic materials used in blood storage were evaluated for their ability to transmit ultraviolet B (UVB) light. A plastic bag manufactured from sheets of transparent Teflon efficiently (78-86%) transmitted UVB light and was employed in subsequent functional studies of lymphocytes and platelets exposed to UVB light while contained in these bags. In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses. In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients. Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses. No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies. These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system. However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered. 
5	Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. 
2	Esophageal motility in children with Hirschsprung's disease. Esophageal motility was studied in 12 children with Hirschsprung's disease to see if extracolonic motor dysfunction was present in this disorder. Manometric tracings were compared with those from eight children with idiopathic megacolon and from 10 children without esophageal disease or constipation. Amplitude of esophageal contraction waves was significantly higher in children with Hirschsprung's disease than in the other two groups. Swallows that were followed by simultaneous contractions or double-peaked waves were also more common in the group with Hirschsprung's disease (subjects with Hirschsprung's disease, subjects with megacolon, and controls; 57%, 10%, and 8%, respectively). Lower esophageal sphincter characteristics did not differ among the three groups. The increase in simultaneous contractions and double-peaked waves persisted in those children who were reexamined following surgery for Hirschsprung's disease, whereas wave amplitudes fell to a level similar to that observed in the other groups. These data suggest that gastrointestinal motor dysfunction in persons with Hirschsprung's disease is not restricted to the colon, and that some of the observed abnormalities in esophageal motility do not reflect nonspecific responses to megacolon or colonic obstruction. 
4	Late results of 200 repeat coronary artery bypass operations. To determine the clinical outcome and the long-term results of a second coronary artery bypass operation, we studied preoperative clinical status and catheterization data in 200 consecutive patients over a 9-year period (1979 to 1987) (mean follow up time 34 months, maximum 120). The study group included 169 men and 31 women (mean age 58.4 years [7% greater than 70 years]). Sixty-four percent of patients had severe angina (New York Heart Association class IV), 70% had 3-vessel coronary artery disease and 21% had poor left ventricular function. Reoperation was performed after a mean interval of 58 months after the first procedure. A mean of 3.3 distal anastomoses was placed. The operative mortality rate (30 days) was 7.5%, with additional cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, heart failure) in 11.5% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk in women (risk ratio 3.6) and in patients with poor left ventricular function (risk ratio 3.1). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was estimated at 84%, with a rate of 77% for patients with poor left ventricular function (difference not significant). The probability of remaining free of a cardiac-related event (myocardial infarction, angioplasty, third operation, cardiac death) was 64% for 5 years. At the end of follow-up, 79% of the surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II and nearly 50% of patients in the fifth year after the reoperation had good functional status. It is concluded that a reoperation is effective but carries an increased, immediate, operative risk. 
5	Crohn's disease of the lung Two years after developing colonic Crohn's disease, a 17 year old boy presented with focal pulmonary consolidation. A lung biopsy specimen showed areas of non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Although some respiratory abnormalities appear to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous disease affecting the lung has not previously been reported in a child. 
1	Ki-67 immunostaining in human breast tumors and its relationship to prognosis. Ki-67 labeling was quantified in 37 nonmalignant breast tissues and in 63 breast carcinomas by counting ten random high-power fields each in three section planes (RC) or by evaluation of the area with the highest labeling density (HDC). Both procedures proved to be highly correlated (rs = 0.94). Ki-67-positive fractions of the nonmalignant tissues (mean, 2.1% for RC and 4.1% for HDC) were significantly lower as compared with the carcinomas (mean, 14.5% for RC and 17.5% for HDC). In carcinomas the Ki-67 labeling was significantly associated with pT stage, axillary lymph node status, and tumor grading and inversely related to progesterone receptor status. Using the medians of both counting methods (12% for RC and 17% for HDC) as cutoff points, significantly different curves for overall and disease-free survival (median follow-up, 37 months) were obtained. However, Cox multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate an independent effect of Ki-67 labeling. In contrast, Ki-67 reactivity seems to be of independent prognostic value if a higher cutoff level was selected. 
4	Involvement of thromboxane and neutrophils in multiple-system organ edema with interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) produces toxicity characterized by generalized edema within 24 hours. This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment. 
4	Diagnosis and management of familial dyslipoproteinemia in children and adolescents. CAD results from atherosclerosis, a chronic disease process that has its origin in childhood. Children and adolescents can be at higher risk for CAD by virtue of being from families with premature CAD or familial dyslipoproteinemias. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels result from a number of complex metabolic processes that are under the control of genetic and environmental (e.g., diet) influences. The normal ranges of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in children are known, and children and adolescents with dyslipoproteinemia are ordinarily defined as those having levels of plasma total, LDL, or triglyceride above the 95th percentile or with a low HDL cholesterol below the 5th percentile. Children of a parent with documented dyslipoproteinemia or with family history of premature CAD may be screened in the fasting state any time after 2 years of age. Following the exclusion of secondary causes of dyslipoproteinemia, the diagnosis of primary dyslipoproteinemia can be made. Lipoprotein patterns are not diagnostic for a given genotype. Efforts to determine further the biochemical defects responsible for a given phenotype have led to the investigation of gene coding for the apolipoproteins, the key enzymes in the lipoproteins pathways (LPL, HDL, and LCAT) and the receptors that process lipoproteins, such as the LDL receptor and the chylomicron remnant receptor. From a practical standpoint, the diagnosis of the kind of dyslipoproteinemia in a child will depend upon the nature and severity of the dyslipoproteinemia, both in the child (or adolescent) and in parents and siblings. Marked increases in plasma total and LDL cholesterol in the child and in at least one of the parents often reflect the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited dominant condition due to a defect in the LDL receptor gene. The triglyceride levels are often normal. If the child has a different dyslipoproteinemia pattern from siblings and parents, then the diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia should be considered. Most children with mild or borderline elevations in total and LDL cholesterol will have polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Triglyceride problems in children and adolescents are relatively uncommon, particularly the more severe hypertriglyceridemia such as that found in lipoprotein lipase and apoC-II deficiency, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and type V hyperlipoproteinemia. High levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein, in isolation or in combination with other dyslipoproteinemia, accelerate risk for CAD. Low levels of HDL cholesterol in the absence of other abnormalities suggest the diagnosis of hypoalphalipoproteinemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
3	IgM deposits at nodes of Ranvier in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anti-GM1 antibodies, and multifocal motor conduction block. We studied a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multifocal motor conduction block, and IgM anti-GM1 antibodies. A sural nerve biopsy demonstrated deposits of IgM at nodes of Ranvier by direct immunofluorescence. The deposits were granular and located in the nodal gap between adjacent myelin internodes, and in some instances, they extended along the surface of the paranodal myelin sheath. When injected into rat sciatic nerve, the serum IgM bound to the nodes of Ranvier, and the binding activity was removed by preincubation with GM1. These observations suggest that anti-GM1 antibodies may have caused motor dysfunction by binding to the nodal and paranodal regions of peripheral nerve. 
1	Patterns of growth and metastases of induced pancreatic cancer in relation to the prognosis and its clinical implications. To understand high malignancy of pancreatic cancer, the growth and metastatic patterns of pancreatic cancer induced in Syrian hamsters were examined. In this model, induced tumors resemble the human disease morphologically, clinically, biologically, and immunologically. In the current study, primary-induced cancer and transplants of pancreatic cancer cell line (PC-1) into the SC tissue or pancreas of homologous hosts were used. In the primary-induced pancreatic cancer, perineural invasion was the most common path (88%), followed by lymphogenic (31%) or vascular (2%) metastases. Inoculation of PC-1 cells into the pancreas resulted in 100% tumor take within 3 weeks. Of 19 intrapancreatic allografts, all showed peritoneal invasion, 5 (26%) liver metastases, 3 (16%) lymph node metastases, 17 (89%) perineural invasion, and none vascular invasion. Even microscopic tumors were found to metastasize primarily via perineural spaces. It was also demonstrated, for the first time, that cancer cells take this route to reach distant tissues, including the lymph nodes. Intraductal spreading occurred in both primary cancers and intrapancreatic allografts either continuously or discontinuously. The patterns of discontinuous intraductal tumor expansion imitated tumor multicentricity. Although perineural invasion was the most common feature of primary cancer and intrapancreatic allografts, lymphatic, hepatic, and vascular invasion and metastases usually occurred in advanced cases. Environmental factors seem to influence expansion and metastases, as evidenced by differences in growth and in metastatic patterns between SC and intrapancreatic allografts. 
4	Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported. No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival. 
5	Persistent rectal ulcer associated with human papillomavirus type 33 in a patient with AIDS: successful treatment with isotretinoin. Rectal dysplasia and carcinoma associated with human papillomavirus infection are increasing in prevalence among homosexual men, particularly those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. We report a case involving a 39-year-old homosexual man with AIDS who developed a persistent rectal ulcer. A biopsy of the ulcer revealed severe squamous dysplasia, and human papillomavirus type 33 was detected in rectal tissue with use of in situ DNA hybridization. This genotype of virus has not been previously associated with anal or rectal dysplasia in homosexual men, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The rectal ulcer resolved after 2 months of oral therapy with 60 mg/d of isotretinoin, a retinoid. 
3	Paraesthesiae and tetany induced by voluntary hyperventilation. Increased excitability of human cutaneous and motor axons. Anxiety can induce hyperventilation, and the resultant hypocapnia and hypocalcaemia can lead to paraesthesiae and tetany. To define the nature of the disturbance created in peripheral nerve, the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons was monitored in 6 normal subjects requested to hyperventilate until paraesthesiae developed in the hands, face and trunk. This occurred when alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) had declined on average by 20 mmHg. Spontaneous EMG activity developed when PACO2 had declined by a further 4 mmHg. Changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons were measured from changes in the compound action potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded over the digital nerves of the index finger and over the thenar muscles, respectively. As PACO2 declined, the size of the compound sensory and muscle potentials evoked by a constant stimulus progressively increased, indicating an increase in axonal excitability. These changes occurred before paraesthesiae or tetany developed. In each subject there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between PACO2 and axonal excitability. Independent of this increase in axonal excitability, there was no significant change in the supernormal phase of the recovery cycle of cutaneous axons. Microneurographic recordings from the median nerve in 2 subjects revealed spontaneous bursting activity of cutaneous axons, perceived as paraesthesiae. It is concluded that the paraesthesiae and tetany induced by hyperventilation result solely from changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons in the peripheral nerve, presumably due to an alteration in the electrical properties of the axonal membrane resulting from a reduced plasma [Ca2+]. The supernormal phase may entrain the ectopic discharge and thereby determine the maximal discharge frequency of impulses in ectopically generated trains, but does not otherwise contribute to the physiological disturbance. 
2	Gastric injury and invasion of parietal cells by spiral bacteria in rhesus monkeys. Are gastritis and hyperchlorhydria infectious diseases? The possibility of using the rhesus monkey as a model for studying gastric function in the presence of infection with spiral bacteria was studied. Endoscopic evaluation of the gastric mucosa was performed under general anesthesia in 29 colony-bred rhesus monkeys, and gastric pinch biopsy specimens were obtained from each animal. On a separate day, gastric emptying and acid output were determined using a 99mTc dilution technique. Biopsy samples were fixed for light microscopy (H&E, Gram, and Warthin-Starry stains) and for transmission electron microscopy. The presence of spiral bacteria and gastritis was assessed and rated on coded slides. In 8 of 29 monkeys, Helicobacter pylori-like organisms were observed in close proximity to the mucosal epithelial cells or in the lumen of the gastric pits. In 14 other monkeys, "Gastrospirillum hominis"-like organisms were observed in the mucus covering the surface of epithelial cells, in the lumina of the gastric glands, and overlying parietal cells. Gastritis was present in 8 of 8 animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms, in 2 of 14 animals positive for "G. hominis"-like organisms, and in none of the uninfected monkeys, and the mean gastritis index was significantly greater in animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Moreover, acid output was significantly higher in monkeys positive for "G. hominis"-like organisms than in controls or animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Gastric emptying was not significantly different in the three groups. In conclusion, (a) H. pylori-like, but not "G. hominis"-like, organisms cause gastritis while not modifying acid output; (b) "G. hominis"-like, but not H. pylori-like organisms, invade and on occasion damage parietal cells while apparently causing hyperchlorhydria; and (c) the rhesus monkey appears to be a good model for the study of gastric infection with spiral bacteria. 
5	Clinical efficacy of PTCA and identification of restenosis: evaluation by serial body surface potential mapping. We used serial body surface potential mapping (BSPM) with the departure map technique to evaluate the clinical efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in various pathophysiologic stages of coronary artery disease, and to detect restenosis. The BSPM was performed prior to, 1 week after, and 1 month after PTCA. A follow-up coronary angiography was performed 3 to 6 months after PTCA, and BSPM was also performed at the same time. The results of BSPM were compared with those of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) and radionuclide ventriculography. After PTCA, BSPM showed a significant reduction in the departure area, the Tl-201 SPECT also showed a significant reduction in the extent and severity scores, and the left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly. In the cases with restenosis, the departure area, which had decreased in size after PTCA, showed an increase in size. After successful re-PTCA, the size of the departure area again became smaller. We concluded that BSPM, which is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method, is useful in the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PTCA and in the detection of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
4	Isolated pulmonary valvular regurgitation: current perspectives. IPVR is a rare clinical entity that was first diagnosed during life in 1955. In the past 35 years, only 69 patients have been reported. With increasing clinical awareness, as well as use of PDE, the confirmation of its clinical diagnosis has become easier and more accurate without having to take recourse to invasive cardiac studies as in the past. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly apparent that IPVR is not so rare as has been suggested in the past. IPVR is more common in men than in women, in whites than blacks, and in the young than the elderly. The mean age of IPVR patients is 27 years (range, 4 to 85). The majority of the patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is usually suspected upon the discovery of a crescendo-decrescendo, low-pitched, early to mid diastolic murmur in the second and third left intercostal space, which increases during inspiration, particularly in the presence of a hyperdynamic right ventricle and in the absence of peripheral circulatory phenomenon of aortic regurgitation. The ECG often shows right axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and rarely, right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. However, a normal ECG does not preclude its diagnosis. Approximately 30% of the IPVR patients have normal 12-lead ECGs. The diagnosis may be further suggested by the posteroanterior chest roentgenogram when dilated and large central pulmonary arteries are noted to pulsate vigorously (hilar dance) on chest fluoroscopy. 
1	Tumor of the atrioventricular nodal region. A clinical and immunohistochemical study. Autopsy specimens of 17 tumors of the atrioventricular nodal region were studied. Sudden death occurred in 14 children and adults; seven of these patients had a history of atrioventricular block or syncope. Three tumors were incidental findings in infants with other congenital anomalies; diaphragmatic agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Meckel's diverticulum in one patient; mitral atresia in one; and congenital hydrocephalus, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and patent omphalovitelline duct in the third. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated strong positivity for carcinoembryonic antigen in 13 of 13 cases, B72.3 antigen in 5 of 7 cases, and cytokeratin in 11 of 11 cases. Twenty control cases of mesothelioma and mesothelial hyperplasia were all negative for B72.3; one showed focal carcinoembryonic antigen staining. Ultrastructural analysis of one case demonstrated short rudimentary microvilli not characteristic of mesothelial cells. We conclude that so-called mesotheliomas of the atrioventricular nodal region are not of mesothelial origin, because of strong carcinoembryonic antigen positivity and occasional positivity with B72.3, as these antibodies react with glycoproteins found in endodermally derived tissue and generally not with mesothelial tissue. Conduction system tumors are most likely congenital rests of endodermal origin, can be associated with other congenital anomalies, and often cause symptoms of heart block and sudden death. 
3	Imaging the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters using transvaginal sonography. High-frequency transvaginal probes were used at 20-40 weeks' gestation to develop a systematic examination of the fetal brain. Modeling the procedure after the standard neonatal neurosonographic examination, we attempted to obtain three coronal sections (anterior, midline, posterior) and two sagittal sections (midsagittal, right or left parasagittal). In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities. We recommend that a complete fetal neurosonographic examination include transvaginal sonography to complement and enhance the transabdominal examination, especially for cases in which a fetal abnormality is suspected. 
1	Efficacy and complications of radiotherapy of anterior visual pathway tumors. A progressive disturbance in visual acuity or visual field, along with an unexplained optic nerve atrophy, suggests the possibility of a tumor. Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas. The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system. Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases. This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications. Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented. 
2	Features distinguishing secondary achalasia from primary achalasia. Eighteen patients with cancer-induced or secondary achalasia (SA) were compared to 421 patients with idiopathic or primary achalasia (PA). The aim of the study was to detect any differences in clinical presentation between the two groups. Mean age of patients with SA was 57.1 (range 15-78) and 47.1 (range 1-90) in patients with PA (p = 0.02). Three patients with SA were 15, 24, and 36 yr old, respectively. Symptom frequency was comparable in SA versus PA. Mean duration of symptoms in SA was 4.5 months, with 15 of the 18 patients experiencing symptoms for six months or less. Weight loss occurred in 88.2% of patients with SA and 57.3% of patients with PA (p less than 0.05). Cancer was at the gastroesophageal junction in 16 patients, duodenum in one, and breast in one. Endoscopy showed tumor in 12 (67%). The esophagram was suspicious for tumor in only 25%. We conclude that patients with SA are older, more likely to lose weight, and have a short duration of symptoms. However, SA may occur in younger patients, and endoscopy with biopsy is necessary in any newly diagnosed case of achalasia. 
4	Effects of mental exercise in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. An echocardiographic Doppler study. To assess the effects of mental stress on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure, nine patients aged 57 +/- 12 years with dilated cardiomyopathy (end-diastolic volume, more than 110 ml/m2; ejection fraction, less than 40%; mean, 28 +/- 8%) and congestive heart failure in New York Heart Association functional class II or III and 14 normal volunteers (mean age, 49 +/- 8 years) were studied during mental arithmetic lasting 10 minutes with echocardiographic Doppler monitoring of transmitral flow velocity. During mental arithmetic, the ratio of peak flow velocity in early versus late diastole (E/A) and deceleration time of early diastole did not change in normal controls. However, E/A increased significantly (from 1.6 +/- 1.5 to 1.9 +/- 1.7; p less than 0.01) and deceleration time markedly decreased (from 156 +/- 49 to 108 +/- 31 msec; p less than 0.001) in patients with congestive heart failure. In 16 postinfarct patients with ejection fraction of less than 40% studied during mental arithmetic with simultaneous hemodynamics and Doppler recordings, good correlations were found between pulmonary wedge pressure and Doppler parameters (wedge pressure versus E/A, r = 0.89; wedge pressure versus deceleration time, r = -0.87). During mental arithmetic, the pulmonary wedge pressure-E/A correlation was weaker (r = 0.67), whereas the correlation between pulmonary wedge pressure and deceleration time was stronger (r = 0.91). The value of 153 msec in deceleration time was the best cutoff point in predicting 12 mm Hg pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during mental arithmetic: the higher the deceleration time, the lower the pulmonary wedge pressure, and vice versa. Among patients with congestive heart failure, five showed normal baseline deceleration time (195 +/- 21 msec; pattern 1), and the remaining four showed a short (less than 153 msec) deceleration time (108 +/- 13 msec; pattern 2). During mental arithmetic, deceleration time markedly decreased to as short as 119 +/- 20 msec in all patients except one with baseline pattern 1. Deceleration time further decreased to 75 +/- 6 msec in all patients with baseline pattern 2. Mental arithmetic induces changes in left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure. Transmitral echocardiographic Doppler provides a simple noninvasive method of estimating and monitoring pulmonary wedge pressure in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. 
1	Parotid gland and facial nerve trauma: a retrospective review. Included in this study are all patients with trauma to the parotid region seen at our center from 1979 to 1989. There was a total of five patients with injury to the parotid area: two patients with isolated facial nerve injury; one with isolated parotid duct injury; two with combined duct and nerve injury. There were four males and one female, with a mean age of 34 years (range, 16 to 62 years). The three patients with parotid duct injury required other procedures for associated trauma. A total of eight nerve branches were severed in four patients. Seven of the eight nerve branches (82.5%) were primarily repaired, with excellent functional results. Two of the three ductal injuries were repaired primarily over a stent, and one was ligated. No complications resulted from either treatment. Based on our clinical experience and review of the literature, we suggest that the treatment of parotid region injuries should include: 1) a complete initial assessment; 2) primary repair of parotid duct transection within 24 hours when possible; 3) primary repair of all facial nerve injuries, although delayed nerve repair remains a viable alternative; and 4) nonsurgical treatment of sialoceles and fistulae. 
5	A comparative study of terbinafine versus griseofulvin in 'dry-type' dermatophyte infections. We conducted a double-blind comparative study of terbinafine, 250 mg twice daily, versus griseofulvin, 500 mg twice daily, for 6 weeks in chronic dermatophyte infections of the feet or hands. All but three patients (total 31) had Trichophyton rubrum infection. At 12-week follow-up, 100% of the terbinafine-treated group were free from infection compared with 45% of those treated with griseofulvin. Therapy in 75% of the terbinafine-treated group and in 35% of those given griseofulvin was rated as effective overall at long-term follow-up, although these differences were not statistically significant. Six months after treatment all nine patients whose skin had cleared with terbinafine therapy remained in remission versus only one of seven patients treated with griseofulvin. None of the patients in either group experienced serious adverse effects. 
4	Serum cholesterol levels and survival in elderly hypertensive patients: analysis of data from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. The relation between serum cholesterol and mortality was investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to treatment with diuretics, with or without methyldopa, or placebo. Cox's proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment serum total cholesterol levels were independently and inversely correlated with total mortality (p = 0.03), noncardiovascular mortality (p = 0.02), and cancer mortality (p = 0.04) during treatment. Total and noncardiovascular mortality were also negatively correlated with pretreatment hemoglobin levels and body weight. All factors being equal, an increase in total serum cholesterol of 2.3 mmol/L was associated with a one-year prolongation of survival. After adjustment for gender, age, pretreatment cardiovascular complications, and systolic pressure, the correlations between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular and cardiac mortality were not significant. 
2	Liver disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: prognostic indicators. We reviewed the clinical presentation, subsequent course, and outcome of 98 patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency seen at our institution during the past 20 years to obtain answers to the following questions: (1) What prognostic factors aid in determining the course of liver disease in affected patients? (2) When is the appropriate time for referral to a liver transplant center? (3) Does breast-feeding prevent chronic liver disease? (4) What is the incidence of severe liver disease in family members? Our analysis revealed that the initial values of alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, and trypsin inhibitory capacity may have prognostic value. During clinical follow-up the recurrence or persistence of hyperbilirubinemia along with deteriorating results of coagulation studies indicated the need for liver transplantation because of imminent poor outcome. Girls had a worse prognosis than boys. Initial breast-feeding versus feeding of commercial formulas did not influence overall overcome. The incidence of significant liver disease among "at risk" siblings was 21% (3/14); if one assumes mendelian inheritance from heterozygous parents, the overall risk for siblings in our families was 5%. 
3	Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects. The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury. We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems. This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study. The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury. This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to. Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room. The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences. Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without. This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety. It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma. 
3	Traumatic intracranial aneurysms caused by missiles: their presentation and management. Only 30 cases of traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) secondary to missile injury have been reported to date. To these we add 15 more cases. Missile TICAs are often seen on a secondary branch of the middle cerebral artery and are usually accompanied by a intracerebral hematoma (80%) or by an acute subdural hematoma (26%). Fourteen of our cases were secondary to shrapnel injuries and only one was secondary to a bullet. None of the injuries was through-and-through. TICAs may enlarge in time and, seemingly inoffensive, may rupture and lead to death. All seven TICAs studied histologically proved to be false aneurysms. TICAs are best treated through trapping and excision. The outcome depends on the patient's status and level of consciousness before surgery. Indications for angiography are discussed. 
5	Enlarged cisterna magna and the Dandy-Walker malformation: factors associated with chromosome abnormalities. Thirty-three fetuses with an enlarged cisterna magna (10 mm or more) were evaluated to determine factors that might be associated with an underlying chromosome abnormality. Eighteen fetuses (55%) proved to have a chromosome abnormality, including trisomy 18 or trisomy 18 variant (12), trisomy 13 (three), Turner syndrome (one), or other rearrangements (two). Among various risk factors analyzed, the absence of ventricular dilatation correlated most strongly with a chromosome abnormality. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 17 of 22 fetuses (77%) lacking ventricular dilatation, compared with only one of 11 fetuses (9%) with ventricular dilatation (P less than .001). Other factors statistically associated (P less than .01) with an underlying chromosome abnormality included mild enlargement of the cisterna magna (10-14 mm), concurrent anomalies detected sonographically, and fetal growth retardation. However, stepwise logistic regression showed that only the absence of ventricular dilatation and the presence of concurrent anomalies were significant when multiple factors were evaluated. These observations support the utility of evaluating the cisterna magna as part of a routine anatomical survey. 
5	Endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia: a comparison of patients with normal, enlarged, and fibroid uteri. One hundred sixty-one patients underwent endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of refractory menorrhagia. Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids, which had been documented clinically, ultrasonographically, or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other. All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy. Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow. After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus. 
5	Effects of diltiazem on complications and restenosis after coronary angioplasty. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial was performed to evaluate the usefulness of empiric therapy with a calcium antagonist in patients who undergo coronary angioplasty. A total of 201 patients were randomized to placebo or to high-dose diltiazem (mean dose, 329 mg/day). Treatment began 24 hours before angioplasty. Restenosis was assessed by percent area stenosis as determined by quantitative angiographic techniques before, immediately and 1 year after angioplasty. All patients also received aspirin and dipyridamole before angioplasty. Heparin and verapamil were administered intravenously during the procedure. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, extent of coronary artery disease, smoking history, and baseline lipid levels. Procedural complications, including death (1 vs 1), Q-wave infarction (0 vs 3), acute occlusion (5 vs 5) and focal spasm (0 vs 0), were not significantly different in the diltiazem and placebo patients, respectively. Freedom from all acute complications was noted in 85% of patients in both groups. One-year angiographic follow-up was obtained in 60% of patients. Restenosis rates were similar: 36% in the diltiazem group and 32% in the placebo group (p = 0.30). The incidence of late cardiac events (death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, recurrent angina or coronary bypass graft surgery) was similar in the 2 groups. Thus, diltiazem did not influence the overall restenosis rate or prevent late events after coronary angioplasty. 
5	Use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in a Jehovah's Witness refusing transfusion of blood products: case report. Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) administration to a Jehovah's witness refusing blood transfusions increased her nadir packed cell volume from 13% to 37% and reticulocyte count from 2% to 17.7%. R-HuEPO may provide an alternative safe and effective therapy in life-threatening anemia when blood transfusions are unacceptable to the patient. 
2	High ethanol consumption as risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage in young and middle-aged people. We examined the prevalence of high ethanol intake, hypertension, and other risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in a case-control study of 24 young and middle-aged patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We recorded ethanol consumption, history of hypertension, liver disease, cigarette smoking, and mild or severe coagulation disorder in each case of intracerebral hemorrhage and in 48 control patients matched by sex and age. In univariate matched analyses, the frequencies of high ethanol intake (p = 0.009), hypertension (p = 0.05), and coagulation disorder (p = 0.05) were higher in the cases than in the controls. After controlling for possible confounding factors, we found that high ethanol intake and hypertension were the only independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively). The hemorrhagic lesion found in cases with a high ethanol intake tended to be located in the cerebral lobes (p = 0.01), contrasting with the typical basal ganglia location of hypertensive hematomas (p = 0.009). We conclude that chronic, high ethanol intake should be considered as an important risk factor for lobar hematomas in young and middle-aged people. 
4	Parental history is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease: the Framingham Study. Family history of CAD, defined as parental death by CAD, was found to be a significant independent predictor of CAD in a logistic regression model controlling for standard risk factors and length of follow-up among the 5209 participants in the Framingham Study. Persons with a positive parental history have a 29% increased risk of CAD, and the strength of the association between parental history and CAD is similar to that found for other standard risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, and cigarette smoking. No evidence was found that persons with a family history of CAD have a decreased capacity to cope with the deleterious effects of known risk factors; that is, no significant interaction was found between any of the risk factors and parental history of CAD. Among men with low risk for CAD by risk-factor profile (i.e., nonsmoking, thin, nonhypertensive persons), more than two thirds of those who experience CAD have a positive parental history. This study suggests that CAD among persons who are predicted to be at low risk by standard risk factors may have a substantial genetic component and that the risk associated with parental history may not be reduced by modification of these factors. Nevertheless, among persons with a positive family history, those with a favorable risk profile are at substantially less risk for CAD than those with an unfavorable risk profile. 
3	Use of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms to predict future vulnerability to side effects. OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes varies widely, even within age and sex subgroups. Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this, but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age, sex, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes, neuroleptic drug doses, and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed, these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy. 
5	A phase II study of combined methotrexate and teniposide infusions prior to reinduction therapy in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination. 
4	Abdominal aortic aneurysm: results of a family study. Data pertaining to abdominal aortic aneurysm among first-degree relatives of 91 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm are presented. The percentage of families with at least one affected first-degree relative of the proband (multiplex families) was 15.4%. In 21.4% of multiplex families parent-offspring transmission of abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted; in the remaining families only siblings were affected. The mean age at onset among probands was 67.3 years; that among all affected was 67.4 years. No statistically significant difference in the mean ages at onset between genders was noted. Among affected siblings of probands, the sex ratio, male:female, was 1.33:1, which is not significantly different from 1:1. The relative risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm was 3.97 for fathers, 4.03 for mothers, 9.92 for brothers, and 22.93 for sisters. 
3	Bilateral homonymous visual field defects as initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Symptomatic suprageniculate lesions in multiple sclerosis expressed as a visual field defect are infrequent. The present case developed a bilateral homonymous defect as the initial and unique symptom of the disease. It was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, which disclosed extensive demyelinating areas in both optic nerve radiations. The mode of onset, perimetric findings, and unusual presentation of this condition are briefly discussed. 
2	A pilot study of suramin in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Suramin sodium is an aromatic polysulfonated compound that was originally introduced as an antiparasitic agent in the 1920s. Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule. 
3	The frequency, causes and timing of death within 30 days of a first stroke: the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. In a prospective, community-based study of 675 consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke, of whom over 90% had computed tomography (CT) and/or necropsy examinations, 129 deaths occurred within 30 days of the onset of symptoms, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%. The 30 day CFR for patients with cerebral infarction was 10% (57 of 545, for primary intracerebral haemorrhage 52% (34 of 66), for subarachnoid haemorrhage 45% (15 of 33) and for those of uncertain pathological type 74% (23 of 31). The CFR for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 33% compared with 17% for those who had been independent pre-stroke. The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was not significantly greater (1.8, 95% confidence interval 0 to 4.3). There was a significant trend for CFR to increase with age (Chi square for trend = 4.0, p less than 0.05). This relationship was found in those patients who had been functionally independent prestroke (Chi square for trend = 7.9, p less than 0.005) but not in those who had been dependent pre-stroke (Chi square for trend = 0.5, NS). The pattern of increasing CFR with increasing age amongst those who had been independent prestroke was seen particularly in patients with cerebral infarction (Chi square for trend = 8.6, p less than 0.005). The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients with cerebral infarction who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.1). Fifty three percent of all deaths within 30 days of stroke were due to the direct neurological sequelae of the stroke. 
5	Bacteriologic quality of intraoperative autotransfusion. Controversies remain about the bacteriologic aspects of intraoperative blood salvage despite the widespread use of this technique. In this prospective study, intraoperative salvaged blood was cultured in 401 patients, according to a direct plating technique. Bacterial growth was detected in 12.7% of cases. These results were compared with those obtained in control studies with sterile water and blood bank units under the same culture conditions. Most microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by other skin and environmental contaminants. Quantitative estimates of contaminations showed low counts of colony-forming units (CFU/ml): 82% of positive cultures yielded 1 or 2 CFU/ml and 6% had 5 to 20 CFU/ml. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months to detect septic complications. No statistically significant correlation could be found between bacteriologic results of autotransfused blood and infectious complications. This study suggests that bacteriologic monitoring of patients who have undergone autotransfusion may help in detecting surgical field contamination. It also confirms that intraoperative autotransfusion adds little septic risk to cardiac surgery. 
5	Genital herpes simplex virus infections. There has been a dramatic increase in patient visits to physicians for evaluation and treatment of genital herpes infections. This has resulted in part from an increase in genital herpes infections, particularly severe, first-episode genital herpes infections in adults without prior HSV-1 infection. Virus culture remains the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis, and use of viral cultures is encouraged. Type-specific antibody tests have been employed in studies documenting the role of asymptomatic shedding of HSV in transmission of genital infections, the role of genital HSV in transmission of HIV, the predominance of asymptomatic and unrecognized infections in those infected with HSV-2, and the presence of past asymptomatic or unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 in 25% of persons presenting with first-episode genital herpes. Unfortunately, commercially available serologic tests do not reliably differentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recent studies suggest that the annual risk of transmission from a sexual partner with genital herpes is about 10% in heterosexual couples. Currently, promotion of "safe sex" is the only available approach for prevention of transmission. However, ongoing research is focused on the development of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir should be used routinely in persons with first-episode genital herpes, but careful evaluation is needed in persons with recurrent genital herpes to determine whether episodic or suppressive treatment is indicated. Acyclovir should also be used routinely for episodic or suppressive treatment of HSV infections in persons with AIDS. Additional antiviral agents are needed for more effective suppressive therapy and for treatment of ACV-resistant HSV infections in the immunocompromised host. 
5	Premature alveolar bone loss in Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis. Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge. This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease. A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption. He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis. Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues. In the ensuring years, accelerated resorption of the residual ridges precluded the use of conventional dentures. We recommend early preventive dental management for patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. 
5	Five-year results of coronary bypass grafting for patients older than 70 years: role of internal mammary artery. Despite numerous references to the superiority of the internal mammary artery (IMA) over the saphenous vein for myocardial revascularization, its role in the elderly is still in question. From January 1984 through December 1988, 1,081 patients older than 70 years (mean age, 74.9 years) underwent bypass grafting, 354 (33%) receiving left IMA grafts based on the surgeon's preference and 727 (67%) receiving vein grafts only. Selection bias resulted in a higher incidence of known risk factors (such as cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, wall motion abnormalities, and preoperative combined New York Heart Association/Canadian Cardiovascular Association functional class IV) in patients in whom the IMA was not used. However, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, and left main disease were not contraindications for using IMA grafts. The operative mortality rate was significantly lower in IMA patients (2.8% versus 7.6%). The actuarial 5-year survival rate (standard error) was higher in patients with IMA grafts, 89% (3%) versus 78% (2%), and postoperative functional class improved to a greater extent in IMA patients (87% of patients were in classes I and II). Arrhythmias and myocardial infarction were significant causes of late death only in patients with vein grafts. When patients are older than 70 years, patient selection factors clearly play an important role in the differential results between patients in whom the IMA is used and patients in whom vein grafts are used. As in younger patients, excellent results can be achieved in the elderly. 
1	Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. 
5	Nonhomologous chromatid exchange in hereditary and sporadic renal cell carcinomas. For the development of renal cell carcinomas, it has been suggested that a germ-line or somatic mutation occurs on one of the homologous chromosomes 3p, and subsequently the other 3p segment is lost. We have examined the karyotype and/or the allelic combination on chromosomes 3 and 5 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in normal kidney and tumor samples from 28 renal cell carcinomas that developed in two patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease; we then compared the results to those of sporadic tumors. An unbalanced translocation between chromosome 3p and 5q or other chromosomes was found to be the most common aberration. We developed a model of nonhomologous chromatid exchange involving breakpoint clusters at chromosomes 3p13, 3p11.2, 5q22, and 8q11.2. Subsequent chromatid segregation may result in net loss of the 3p segment either (i) in one step or (ii) after a nondisjunctional loss of the derivative chromosome carrying the 3p segment. This general mechanism could also be implicated to explain genetic changes occurring in other types of solid tumors. 
4	Auto-PEEP during CPR. An "occult" cause of electromechanical dissociation? A 64-year-old man with severe COPD developed refractory nonperfusing sinus rhythm after intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. Fifteen minutes after resuscitative efforts were halted, the patient was noted to have spontaneous respirations and blood pressure, suggesting that dynamic hyperinflation was responsible for the observed electromechanical dissociation (EMD). We recommend a brief trial of apnea for patients with COPD and EMD when conventional measures are unsuccessful. 
1	Scoring system for the preoperative evaluation of metastatic spine tumor prognosis. An assessment system for the prognosis of metastatic spine tumors was evaluated for 64 cases who had undergone surgery. Six parameters were employed in the assessment system: 1) the general condition, 2) the number of extraspinal bone metastases, 3) the number of metastases in the vertebral body, 4) metastases to the major internal organs (lungs, liver, kidneys, and brain), 5) the primary site of the cancer, and 6) the severity of spinal cord palsy. Each parameter ranged from 0 to 2 points. The total score obtained for each patient can be correlated with the prognosis, while being valuable in predicting it. However, the prognosis could not be predicted from a single parameter. In conclusion, an excisional operation should be performed on those cases who scored above 9 points, while a palliative operation is indicated for those who scored under 5 points. 
3	Unusual cause of 'piriformis muscle syndrome'. The piriformis muscle syndrome is a controversial "clinical" syndrome primarily characterized by signs and symptoms of sciatic nerve compression at the region of the piriformis muscle as it passes through the greater sciatic notch. The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle. The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed. 
3	The role of carotid screening before coronary artery bypass. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years. 
5	Cardiac arrest after hypertonic citrate anticoagulation for chronic hemodialysis. The use of regional citrate anticoagulation as an alternative to standard therapy in hemodialysis patients at risk for bleeding complications has been well described. Recently, a method using hypertonic citrate has been reported as being safe and efficacious, and having several advantages over the usual techniques. Two patients who suffered cardiac arrests after dialysis using hypertonic citrate are discussed. Both received anticoagulation as described in the literature, although the citrate infusion rate was lower than recommended. Electrocardiograms obtained during the first such session showed no change in the Q-Tc interval with initiation of the infusion in either patient. Both were noted to have cardiac arrest within 5 minutes of discontinuation of dialysis, without warning symptoms, following the second and fifteenth treatments, respectively. The initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation did not respond to standard advanced cardiac life support therapy, and the patients were not successfully resuscitated until they received intravenous calcium. The authors postulate that the loss of positive calcium flux from the dialysate, in conjunction with circulating unmetabolized citrate, caused an electrolyte imbalance leading to the potentially fatal arrhythmia. Caution is recommended in using this method of regional anticoagulation. 
4	The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain! In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property. Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure. We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades. For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966. 
3	The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome. The acute aseptic meningitis syndrome is an entity that presents a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Although many infectious and noninfectious etiologies exist for this syndrome, viruses, especially nonpolio enteroviruses, are the classic and most important agents encountered. The incidence of polio and mumps meningitis has declined dramatically in the vaccine era, but recently described pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease agent) are now important considerations in the differential diagnosis. Specifically treatable entities (eg, mycobacterial or fungal meningitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, parameningeal infection) that may mimic aseptic meningitis in their initial presentations must not be overlooked. A careful approach to the patient and a rational use of laboratory studies are the basis for establishing a specific diagnosis and assuring a favorable outcome. 
1	Human central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor expressing nerve growth factor receptors: CHP707m. A primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) presented as a cerebral hemispheric mass in a 33-year-old man. Bone marrow metastases were discovered 11 months later. A cell line (CHP707m) was derived from these metastases. In culture, the cells showed features of neuronal differentiation, forming short neurites and synthesizing low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein. Northern blotting showed the tumor cells express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor messenger RNA, and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting demonstrated NGF receptors on the cell surface. Western blotting showed CHP707m NGF receptors are truncated. The receptors are functional; they bind iodine 125-labeled mouse NGF with an affinity of 1.6 x 10(-9) M, and short-term treatment with NGF induces expression by the tumor cells of the proto-oncogene, c-fos. Although CHP707m is the first central nervous system PNET cell line proven to express NGF receptors, immunohistological survey of tissue sections prepared from human central nervous system PNETs showed that 13 of 35 contained NGF receptor-positive tumor cells. Thus, more than one-third of such tumors might be responsive to the effects of NGF. 
5	Cytoreductive hepatic surgery for neuroendocrine tumors. We retrospectively reviewed 37 patients who underwent hepatic resection between 1970 and 1989 to evaluate the role of cytoreductive hepatic surgery in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, 24; islet cell, 13). Seventeen resections were curative (no gross residual tumor); nine patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and seven patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of nine patients with symptomatic endorcrinopathies obtained complete relief of symptoms; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 2 to 82 months (mean, 26 months). Six of seven patients with symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 5 to 28 months (mean, 14 months). One symptom-free patient underwent curative hepatic resection 5 years after abdominoperineal resection for a rectal carcinoid. Twenty resections were palliative (gross residual tumor); 16 patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and 4 patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of 16 patients with symptomatic endocrinopathies obtained complete relief; five are alive at 2 to 30 months (mean, 11 months), with a mean duration of complete relief of 6 months (3 to 12 months). All four patients who underwent resection for symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; two are alive and symptom free at 10 and 101 months. Our experience suggests that curative surgery should be considered in all patients with completely resectable metastatic disease and that palliative surgery, despite the short duration of complete relief, should be considered in selected patients because it delays and may reduce the subsequent need for medical therapy. 
1	Phase II study of fluorouracil and recombinant interferon alfa-2a in previously untreated advanced colorectal carcinoma. We conducted a phase II clinical trial of fluorouracil (5FU) and recombinant interferon alfa-2a (rIFN alpha-2a) in 52 previously untreated patients with bidimensionally measurable metastatic colorectal cancer. During week 1, 5FU was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, 750 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Intravenous bolus administration of 5FU 750 mg/m2 was given weekly for 7 weeks starting on day 12. rIFN alpha-2a (Roferon; Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), 9 x 10(6) U, was administered subcutaneously three times weekly during weeks 1 to 8. Patients were evaluated for response on week 9. Of 52 patients enrolled in the study, 51 were assessable for toxicity, and 45 were assessable for response. Fifteen patients experienced partial response, and one patient achieved a clinical complete response for an overall response rate of 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%, 50%). Median duration of response is 7.5 months (range, 4 to 11 months). Seventy percent of patients entered on the study are alive with a median follow-up duration of 7 months. Twenty-five percent of patients developed grade 4 toxicity, and 82% developed grade 3 toxicity. One drug-related death in the presence of sepsis was reported, and two treatment-related seizures occurred. Our experience with this schedule produced a lower response rate with greater toxicity than previously reported. Current randomized trials comparing this schedule of 5FU with rIFN alpha-2a to 5FU plus folinic acid (leucovorin) or single-agent 5FU may determine its role in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinomas. 
5	Early detection of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs: serial CK-MB sampling in the emergency department [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Apr;20(4):420] STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest discomfort are a difficult problem for emergency physicians. Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing. 
5	Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. 
2	Low diacylglycerol values in colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer. The biochemical events that make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are not well understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100%), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5)%, p less than 0.05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5)%, p less than 0.01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2.62 (0.16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2.45 (0.17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4)%, p less than 0.001, and 71 (4)%, p less than 0.001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis. 
3	Scaphoid malunion. We reviewed 10 patients with symptomatic malunion of a carpal scaphoid fracture. All had displacement with dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability, and suffered from pain, restricted range of movement at the wrist and decreased grip strength. The restriction of flexion-extension and the decreased grip strength correlated with the severity of the DISI deformity. Seven patients had a corrective osteotomy, using an anterior wedge-shape bone graft with internal fixation by Herbert screw, and all had satisfactory results. We believe that symptoms associated with scaphoid malunion are related to consequent carpal deformity. 
2	Prevention of pancreatic fistula by modified pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. A major cause of morbidity after pancreatoduodenectomy is leakage from the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. To prevent this complication, we have employed mucosal stripping from the proximal jejunum prior to end-to-end anastomosis in 19 patients with good results. 
4	Infant survival following delayed postmortem cesarean delivery. A 19-year-old multipara was delivered of a living infant by postmortem cesarean 22 minutes after documented maternal cardiac arrest and 47 minutes from the fatal injury. Neonatal follow-up at 18 months of age demonstrated no evidence of neurologic damage. 
5	Problem solving in implant dentistry. Dental implants have become an accepted form of dental care, with reported functional 5-year success rates of 90% and higher. These impressive statistics include, but do not identify, the problems that may have been created by clinical ineptitude. Diagnostic acumen and preventive measures at each stage of the implant treatment can avoid many problems. Also, appropriate measures of timely recognition, rescue, and repair can often restore ailing implants and their prosthetic appliances to full function. 
5	Mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst from a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome. Mucous cell proliferation in a periapical radicular cyst from a patient with a family history of colonic malignancies and multiple sebaceous neoplasms of the skin, so-called Muir-Torre syndrome, is reported. Such goblet cell hyperplasia has not been previously reported to be associated with any known syndrome. We believe the finding of mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst may not simply be coincidental, but should raise suspicion of paraneoplastic potential and warrant further evaluation for possible occult neoplastic disease. 
2	Endoscopic retrograde brush cytology. A new technique. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been shown to be a very valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of malignancy involving the biliary and/or pancreatic ductal system. However, characteristic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography radiographic findings associated with malignant strictures are frequently not specific and cytological confirmation becomes essential for the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the current overall diagnostic yield of positive cytology in such circumstances ranges from 18%-56% depending on the technique. A new brush device has been designed which is uniquely adapted to pancreaticobiliary strictures of varying anatomical configurations. This study shows results using this new cytology brush in a series of 53 patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy. A significant improvement in the cytological yield of tumor confirmation was obtained with a diagnostic sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% using the new brush technique. 
3	Essential tremor: clinical correlates in 350 patients. To study the demographic and clinical correlates of essential tremor (ET), we analyzed a comprehensive database of 350 patients evaluated at the Movement Disorders Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine from 1982 to 1989. The age at onset of tremor showed bimodal distribution for both male and female patients, with peaks in 2nd and 6th decades. ET appeared most frequently in hands, followed by head, voice, tongue, leg, and trunk. Half of the patients (47%) had associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. At least one 1st-degree relative of 62.5% of ET patients reported tremor. Alcohol relieved tremor in 2/3 of ET patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients who had adequate follow-up improved with propranolol, and 72% with primidone. There was no significant difference in various clinical variables between the 219 patients with familial ET and 131 with sporadic ET. Patients with early-onset ET were more likely to have hand involvement and associated dystonia than patients with late-onset ET. Dystonia was more frequently associated with mild ET than with severe ET. Patients with low-frequency tremor were older and had more head but less hand involvement than patients with high-frequency tremor. The lack of relevant differences between ET subgroups suggests that, despite variable expression, ET represents a single disease entity. 
5	Monitoring of spinal cord stimulation evoked potentials during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery. Repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm involves a significant risk of ischemic injury to the spinal cord. Standard monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, which relies upon peripheral nerve stimulation, becomes nonspecific and insensitive during this surgery when aortic cross-clamping produces lower extremity ischemia causing a peripheral conduction block. Techniques for the insertion of percutaneous epidural electrodes, developed originally for pain management, have been adapted to this setting to permit direct stimulation of the spinal cord for intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials. The clinical outcome in patients monitored by this technique has been consistent with evoked potential findings. 
1	Increasing incidence of cecal and sigmoid carcinoma. Data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. We have studied both the distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer using The Connecticut Tumor Registry, the oldest tumor registry in the United States. During the time period 1973 to 1985, left-sided colon cancers accounted for 63% of the cancers, right-sided cancers 33%, and cancers with unspecified sites 4%. Indeed, this pattern of distribution has remained constant for 25 years. For the period 1935 to 1985, we calculated the sex-specific, age-adjusted (normalized to the 1970 U.S. Census) incidence. Age-adjusted incidence of rectal cancer has remained stable for 50 years: for men, 22.8 cases/100,000/year, and for women, 13.9 cases/100,000/year. During these 50 years, the age-adjusted incidence of cecal carcinoma for men has increased from 3.6 to 16.7 cases/100,000/year, while for women, it has increased from 4.9 to 14.2 cases/100,000/year. Sigmoid carcinoma for men has increased from 8.8 to 18.7 cases/100,000/year, and for women, it has increased from 7.7 to 12.8 cases/100,000/year. The incidence of colon cancer at each site has been and continues to be increasing at a constant rate. Age-adjusted incidence for all colorectal cancers has increased from 35.2 to 70.2 cases/100,000/year for men and from 32.1 to 49.2 cases/100,000/year for women. Thus, distribution of colorectal cancers by site in Connecticut has remained stable for 25 years. More importantly, however, the age-adjusted incidence of colon cancer has continued to increase for 50 years, whereas that of rectal cancer has remained relatively stable. 
4	Efficacy of acebutolol after acute myocardial infarction (the APSI trial). The APSI Investigators. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out to determine the effectiveness of acebutolol in preventing late death in high-risk patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The average 1-year mortality rate in placebo groups of 9 trials of beta blockers in post-MI patients was 7.2% compared with 17% in a nonselected cohort of patients who had survived at least 7 days after an MI. The mandate for this trial was based on the fact that high-risk patients whose mortality rate exceeds 20% have not been enrolled in significant numbers in previous trials. It remains to be proved whether beta-blocking therapy in this patient population is beneficial. Selection of high-risk patients for inclusion in the trial was based on an algorithm set up from the Essai de Prevention Secondaire de l'Infarctus du Myocarde Registry. At the time of the second interim analysis, the mortality rate in the placebo group was 12%, lower than expected (greater than or equal to 20%). The trial was stopped; at that time, 309 patients had been allocated to placebo and 298 patients to acebutolol therapy. After 318 days, there were 17 deaths in the acebutolol-treated group and 34 in the placebo group, a reduction in total mortality of 48% (p = 0.019). There were 30 vascular deaths in the placebo group and 12 in the acebutolol group. Thus, cardiovascular mortality with acebutolol was reduced by 58% (p = 0.006). The incidence of all cardiovascular-related deaths was lower in the acebutolol-treated group. The total reduction in mortality did not appear to be correlated with secondary risk factors. 
1	Touch preparation cytology of breast lumpectomy margins with histologic correlation. Residual microscopic disease after lumpectomy for breast cancer may cause significant local recurrence. We evaluated one hundred fourteen consecutive breast lumpectomy margins in this study by touch preparation cytology. Cytologic preparations were intraoperatively correlated with gross and frozen section results and subsequently with permanent histologic sections of representative margins. Three specimens were cytologically unsatisfactory and 86 yielded benign findings, while material suggestive or diagnostic of malignancy was obtained from 25 specimens. Gross, frozen section, and permanent histologic margins were positive in 10, 17, and 22 cases, respectively. There were three false-positive touch preparation cytologic results, while frozen section specimens were false-negative in five cases. Sensitivity and specificity of touch preparation cytology were 100% and 96.6%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 97.3%. Touch preparation cytologic examination rapidly and reliably evaluates lumpectomy margins and overcomes sampling errors and artifacts related to frozen section evaluation. This technique currently complements frozen section evaluation of lumpectomy margins as part of a protocol aimed at reducing local recurrence of breast cancer. 
2	Effect of tetrahydroaminoacridine on cognition, function and behaviour in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) in Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, multiple crossover trial with three treatment periods, each consisting of 3 weeks of active drug therapy and 3 weeks of placebo administration. SETTING: Referral-based geriatric practice in a community hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-four patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were included if they had stage 3 to 6 disease (as determined by the Reisberg scale) and had not been taking psychotropic drugs for at least 1 month and if informed consent had been obtained from the patients and their next of kin. INTERVENTIONS: Fifty to 100 mg of THA daily and matched placebo. RESULTS: Of the initial 34 patients 14 experienced liver toxicity and 3 gastrointestinal side effects during the study; however, all 22 who completed the study were able to tolerate at least the minimum dose. For the 22 patients there was no clinically or statistically significant effect of THA on cognition, functional status or behaviour. The results for individual patients showed no subgroup of THA-responsive patients. CONCLUSION: THA has no clinically important benefits in Alzheimer's disease and is associated with appreciable toxic effects. 
3	Cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia. Four cases of cauda equina syndrome occurring after continuous spinal anesthesia are reported. In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique. We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury. Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed. Use of a lower concentration and a "ceiling" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered. If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended. If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned. 
3	Atlanto-occipital disarticulation. Accident characteristics. A retrospective study of cases of atlanto-occipital disarticulation was conducted to describe incident characteristics: 24 cases were identified, including nine motor vehicle drivers, two passengers, seven pedestrians, and five motorcyclists; one other person had fallen four stories. The highest rates were found among motorcyclists and pedestrians. Atlanto-occipital disarticulations occur in high-energy impacts and collisions and are associated with aortic laceration in 25% and basilar skull fracture in 21% of such cases. Current restraint systems and motorcycle helmets do not appear to prevent this generally rapidly fatal injury. 
5	Factors influencing the results of open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fractures. Forty-three displaced tibial plateau fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The fractures were classified into four groups, and the clinical results were evaluated using a standard 100-point knee rating system. The average follow-up period after surgery was 2.7 years. Overall there were 35 excellent, five good, three fair, and no poor results. In five of eight knees with a less than excellent score, the results were due to the technique of fracture fixation or the absence of a bone graft. There were ten postoperative complications, but only one ultimately affected the clinical result. Fourteen patients required removal of implants. Roentgenographic analysis showed that six knees had mild degenerative changes, two had moderate, and two had severe degenerative changes. There was no statistically significant association between the fracture type and a less than excellent result. The absence of bone grafting, however, was associated with a less than excellent result. Bicondylar fractures had a mean range of motion of 110 degrees, 18 degrees less than that of all other types of fracture combined. 
4	Hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of quinidine in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Quinidine causes vasodilation directly and by inhibition of adrenergic vasoconstriction, but it also exerts negative inotropic activity. Although this drug is often administered to patients with severe congestive heart failure, the net consequences of these opposing actions have not been evaluated in such patients. The hemodynamic and neurohormonal response to oral quinidine (600 mg) in 19 patients with severe chronic heart failure was therefore determined. Vasodilation was the predominant effect of quinidine, with reductions in mean arterial, left ventricular filling and right atrial pressures of -9% (confidence interval [CI] -5 to -13), -8% (CI -19 to 3), -15% (CI -26 to -4), respectively. The quinidine-induced vasodilation increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations by 44% (CI +17 to +72) and 47% (CI +2 to +91), respectively. No change in cardiac performance was noted, with the cardiac index slightly increased (+10%, CI +2 to +17) and stroke work index unchanged (0%, CI -11 to +11) after quinidine. Although the mean serum quinidine concentration was within the therapeutic range or lower in all patients, the serum quinidine concentration and the change in mean arterial pressure did correlate (r2 = 0.64). In conclusion, vasodilation is the predominant hemodynamic effect of oral quinidine in patients with congestive heart failure. However, potential adverse effects may be caused by consequent neurohormonal activation. 
4	Late complications in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients. Late complications occurring more than 3 months after cardiac transplantation were analyzed in 29 pediatric patients in whom 31 cardiac transplantations were performed. Age at transplantation ranged from 3 months to 18 years (mean, 11.3 years) with follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 54 months (mean, 21.6 months). There were seven late deaths and two patients with retransplantations. Of nine grafts lost, eight were due to acute rejection, and one was due to coronary disease. Four of the grafts lost were secondary to patient noncompliance with prescribed immunosuppression. The mean rejection frequency more than 1 year after cardiac transplantation was significantly higher in those patients who eventually lost their grafts; however, these patients could not be distinguished by their rejection frequency in the first year. Eight patients had coronary disease, with five diagnosed at autopsy, two at cardiac retransplantation, and one by angiography. All eight patients were on double immunosuppression; none of the 19 patients on triple therapy had coronary disease with similar follow-up. There were 12 serious infections in eight patients (four associated with OKT3) with no deaths. Five patients had arrhythmias requiring treatment including two pacemakers; four of the five were associated with rejection episodes. Twelve of 29 patients developed early hypertension, and five developed late hypertension (greater than 1 year). There were two malignancies; one patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma was cured with chemotherapy, and one patient with histiocytic lymphoma was discovered at autopsy. Two patients had cholecystectomies, and five patients required laser gingivectomies. 
4	The relationship of intraluminal shunting to technical results after carotid endarterectomy. This study evaluates the incidence of defects on the intraoperative angiograms of 160 carotid endarterectomies performed in 146 patients, 81 of 160 (50.6%) with a shunt and 79 of 160 operations (49.4%) performed without a shunt. Angiographic defects were identified in 34 of 160 carotid endarterectomies (21%), of which 21 of 34 (65%) resulted in a greater than 20% stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). There were defects in 6 of 81 (7.4%) shunted vessels compared to 16 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). Thirty-one vessels were reexplored 11 of 81 (13.5%) of those shunted and 20 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). There were four strokes (2.5%) (2 in each group) and one death due to myocardial infarction (0.6%) in the postoperative period. Duplex follow-up from 1-60 months (median 22 months) was available in 114 of 160 (71%) endarterectomies. A stenosis of greater than 50% was detected in 7 of 114 (6%) carotid arteries; 5 of the 7 (71%) were shunted and 2 (29%) were nonshunted. Unrepaired defects were present in 3 of 7 (43%) and no defects in the remaining 4 of 7 (57%) arteries. We conclude that the use of a shunt significantly decreases the number of ICA defects detected angiographically and that immediate revision of demonstrable defects can be undertaken with low morbidity and does not predispose the patient to recurrent stenosis. 
1	Multiagent chemotherapy in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. Twenty-seven evaluable children with early first bone marrow relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with an intensive induction/consolidation and ongoing maintenance therapy. Induction therapy consisted of a 35-day course of daunomycin, vincristine, and prednisone, immediately followed by teniposide, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and L-asparaginase. Intrathecal methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and Ara-C were given through the induction/consolidation phase. Twenty-three of 27 patients achieved remission by the end of induction/consolidation. Maintenance with the same drugs in a modified dosage schedule continued for approximately 2 years. A small subgroup of patients who were M3 at day 35 but M1 at day 56 (end of induction/consolidation) and had a cumulative event-free survival (EFS) of only 0.40 at 6 months, all had relapsed by 15 months. However, the EFS for M1 patients by day 35 and maintained on chemotherapy was 0.64 at 12 months and 0.32 at 30, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Although good reinduction and remission duration rates at 12 to 24 months were achieved and an apparent plateau in survival occurs at 30 months, fall-off in survival would not be unexpected with probably less than 20% alive after 5 years. 
4	Quantitative angiographic comparison of the immediate success of coronary angioplasty, coronary atherectomy and endoluminal stenting. Coronary atherectomy and coronary stenting effectively reduce the severity of coronary artery stenoses, but direct comparisons of these interventions with conventional balloon angioplasty have not been performed. To compare the immediate efficacy of these 3 interventions, the angiographic morphology and the severity of the residual coronary stenosis were quantitatively evaluated in 18 patients undergoing coronary atherectomy and in 21 patients treated by endoluminal coronary stenting. Each of these groups of patients was compared with a matched group of coronary angioplasty patients selected from a large, computerized data-base. The variables matched included patient age and sex, lesions site and severity, and lesion complexity. Both coronary atherectomy and coronary stenting more effectively reduced the severity of the coronary stenosis when compared with balloon angioplasty. The luminal diameter stenosis was reduced from 69 +/- 10 to 22 +/- 20% in the atherectomy group compared with a reduction from 74 +/- 11 to 44 +/- 14% in the matched coronary angioplasty population (p = 0.008). Similarly, the luminal diameter stenosis was reduced from 77 +/- 11 to 26 +/- 12% in the stented group compared with a reduction from 81 +/- 10 to 42 +/- 14% in the matched coronary angioplasty group (p = 0.014). In addition, moderate or severe coronary dissections were noted more frequently in the coronary angioplasty groups than in their respective atherectomy and stent groups (0 vs 33%, p = 0.008, and 5 vs 19%, p = 0.15, respectively). 
3	Immunodominant regions for T helper-cell sensitization on the human nicotinic receptor alpha subunit in myasthenia gravis. In myasthenia gravis an autoimmune response against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) occurs. The alpha subunit of the AChR contains both the epitope(s) that dominates the antibody response (main immunogenic region) and epitopes involved in T helper cell sensitization. In this study, overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete AChR alpha-subunit sequence were used to propagate polyclonal AChR-specific T helper cell lines from four myasthenic patients of different HLA types. Response of the T helper lines to the individual peptides was studied. Four immunodominant sequence segments were identified--i.e., residues 48-67, 101-120, 304-322, and 419-437. These regions did not include residues known to form the main immunogenic region or the cholinergic binding site, and they frequently contained sequence motifs that have been proposed to be related to T-epitope formation. 
4	Managing the whole patient with hypertension: practical applications in a clinical setting. Physicians are aware of the value of treating hypertension. Complications such as stroke and congestive heart failure are less likely to occur in the well-controlled patient. In our quest to add coronary heart disease to this list, we must go beyond simple reduction of blood pressure. We must consider other risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and family history. The presence of one or more of these may indicate a more aggressive treatment approach. Similarly the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary disease, or renal disease may indicate specific pharmacotherapy. On the other hand, the low-risk patient with no other problems or conditions may be treated with only nonpharmacologic therapy such as weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and/or alcohol restriction. Every patient has a different constellation of findings. Every patient should be treated individually. It is no longer sufficient just to lower blood pressure; we need to manage the whole patient with hypertension; keeping in mind that most antihypertensive agents are equally effective, the side effect profile is often the decisive factor in choosing an antihypertensive agent. 
5	Characterization of "peak E," a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant ("peak E"). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent. 
1	Fourth branchial pouch anomaly. We present an extremely rare case of fourth branchial fistula in a 23-year-old male. The characteristic clinical feature was a recurrent left lower neck abscess which did not respond to appropriate medical and surgical therapy. Radiography and a computed tomographic scan with contrast material revealed a fistula running from the apex of the left pyriform sinus (internal opening) to the left lower neck abscess. The fistula tract was excised surgically. Histological examination of the excised fistula revealed a squamous epithelial lining and subepithelial lymphoid tissue. This pyriform sinus fistula is thought to be of fourth pharyngeal pouch origin, because of its surgical aspects and the histological findings of the excised fistula. 
1	Malignancy associated with chronic empyema: radiologic assessment. Radiologic findings of six cases of malignancy associated with chronic empyema 5-39 years in duration were reviewed. Pathologic examination confirmed three B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, one round-cell sarcoma, one mesothelioma, and one adenocarcinoma. Retrospective findings on plain chest radiographs suggested the occurrence of malignancy: increased radiopacity in the thoracic cavity, soft-tissue bulgings and/or unsharpness of fat planes in the chest walls, destruction of bone near the empyema, and extensive medial deviation of the calcified pleurae. Computed tomography delineated masses with soft-tissue attenuation more clearly than radiography in all cases. Magnetic resonance images of three cases were informative because empyema cavities were surrounded by low-intensity rims, and two of them showed a signal intensity different from that of necrotic tumors. Scintigraphy revealed increased uptake of gallium in all cases. Ultrasonography was useful for biopsy guidance. Every radiologist should know this entity in observation of chest radiographs obtained in patients with chronic empyema, and further radiologic assessment and aggressive biopsy are recommended if malignancy is suspected. 
5	Three mixed venous saturation catheters in patients with circulatory shock and respiratory failure Thirty-one critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure and circulatory shock were divided into three groups. Group 1 included 11 patients with an inserted mixed venous saturation (SvO2) catheter using three-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament (Oximetrix opticath catheter); group 2 included eight patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament; (Edwards sat-one catheter); group 3 included 12 patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and two detecting fiberoptic filaments. Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention. Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3. The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001). After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05). This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2. The addition of a second detecting fiber optic filament does not seem to improve the accuracy of the system when SvO2 changes occur in conditions of stable hematocrit. 
3	Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All eyes had vitreitis. All of the lesions showed a similar fluorescein angiographic pattern of early hypofluorescence and late staining. Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture. Three of the four patients tested positive for HIV. 
1	Effect of the somatostatin analogue octreotide acetate on hemostasis in humans. Octreotide acetate is a somatostatin analogue that has been shown to ameliorate the side effects of excessive secretion of hormone from benign and malignant tumors. The ability of this drug to inhibit the growth of malignant cells and to control gastrointestinal hemorrhage will prompt additional clinical trials. Because some of these patients may have thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or a coagulopathy, we studied tests of platelet function and blood coagulation in 15 patients before and after 14 days of therapy with octreotide acetate at a dosage of 500 micrograms three times daily. We found no substantial change in the results of these tests, and no patient experienced bleeding or thrombosis. These results suggest that octreotide acetate does not adversely affect platelet function or the coagulation system in humans. 
2	Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. 
1	Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus. A review of nine adenocarcinomas of the esophagus arising in Barrett's epithelium was undertaken. We found the disease among white males disproportionately. Risk factors and incidence rate remain to be clarified. Only one patient was in a surveillance program and only he had carcinoma discovered "early." He still survives while only one of the eight whose diagnosis followed investigation of symptoms remains alive. 
5	Otitis media in day-care children. A report from the International Primary Care Network. The relationship between day care and acute otitis media and its adverse consequences was analyzed as part of a collaborative multinational study. Data from primary care research networks in eight countries were collected on 1335 children, aged 0 to 60 months, at the time of initial visits to their primary care physicians for acute otitis media. A history of recurrent acute otitis media, poor hearing, and tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy were all more frequent in day-care children aged 25 to 60 months, compared with those cared for at home. Day-care children were brought to their physicians more promptly after the onset of symptoms and received more referrals to otolaryngologists at the time of the index visit for acute otitis media. Day care may pose a significant risk for otitis media and its adverse consequences. 
4	Primary orchiectomy versus estrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer--a randomized study: results after 7 to 10 years of followup. Of 163 new consecutively diagnosed cases of advanced (T3-4 M0 or T04M1) prostatic cancer 13 had contraindications for estrogen treatment, and the remainder were randomized to orchiectomy (76) or to estrogen treatment (74), consisting of 150 micrograms ethinyl estradiol daily and 80 mg. polyestradiol monthly. During the followup period of 7 to 10 years disease progression was noted in 27 patients (36%) treated with estrogen and 39 (51%) orchiectomized patients. The free of progression survival rate was significantly better (less than 0.05) among the estrogen treated patients but the over-all survival rates after orchiectomy and estrogen treatment were almost identical. A significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular side effects was noted in the estrogen group (23 cases) compared to the orchiectomy group (4 cases). Therefore, estrogen treatment in this form cannot be recommended for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer. 
5	Gastric infarction. We have described a patient with an acute condition of the abdomen who had infarction of the stomach and the small intestine due to atheromatous thrombus of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. We believe this unusual simultaneous occurrence of gastric and small intestinal infarction is coincidental. The outcome of gastric infarction is frequently fatal. 
5	Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants. Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage. Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes). Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study. Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH. 
1	Expression of transcobalamin II receptors by human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells. Plasma membrane receptors for the serum cobalamin-binding protein transcobalamin II (TCII) were identified on human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells using immunoaffinity-purified human TCII labeled with [57Co]cyanocobalamin. The Bmax values for TCII receptors on proliferating K562 and HL-60 cells were 4,500 and 2,700 per cell, respectively. Corresponding dissociation constants (kd) were 8.0 x 10(-11) mol/L and 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Rabbit TCII also bound to K562 and HL-60 cells but with slightly reduced affinities. Calcium was required for the binding of transcobalamin II to K562 cells. Brief treatment of these cells with trypsin resulted in almost total loss of surface binding activity. After removal of trypsin, surface receptors for TCII slowly reappeared, reaching pretrypsin treatment densities only after 24 hours. Reappearance of receptors was blocked by cycloheximide. TCII receptor densities on K562 and HL-60 cells correlated inversely with the concentration of cobalamin in the culture medium. This suggests that intracellular stores of cobalamin may affect the expression of transcobalamin receptors. Nonproliferating stationary-phase K562 cells had low TCII receptor densities (less than 1,200 receptors/cell). However, the density of TCII receptors increased substantially when cells were subcultured in fresh medium. Up-regulation of receptor expression coincided with increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, which preceded the resumption of cellular proliferation as measured by cell density. In the presence of cytosine arabinoside, which induces erythroid differentiation, K562 cells down-regulated expression of TCII receptors. When HL-60 cells were subcultured in fresh medium containing dimethysulfoxide to induce granulocytic differentiation, the up-regulation of TCII receptors was suppressed. This event occurred well before a diminution of 3H-thymidine incorporation and cessation of proliferation. Thus, changes in the regulation of expression of TCII receptors correlate with both the proliferative and differentiation status of cells. 
4	Retrograde continuous warm blood cardioplegia: a new concept in myocardial protection This report presents the results in our first clinical series of patients receiving continuous warm blood cardioplegia through the coronary sinus. Warm oxygenated blood cardioplegia has certain theoretical advantages, such as continuously supplying oxygen and substrates to the arrested heart while avoiding the side effects of hypothermia. Retrograde infusion of cardioplegia also offers certain advantages (eg, in valve operations and in patients with severe coronary artery disease) that are complementary to warm blood cardioplegia. Retrograde warm blood cardioplegia was used in 113 consecutive patients (85 men and 28 women with a mean age of 61 years) undergoing various procedures. Three percent of the patients died, 7% needed transient intraaortic balloon pump support, 6% had evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, and 96% had spontaneous return of rhythm. There were no coronary sinus injuries. This new technique of retrograde continuous warm blood cardioplegia is a simple, safe, and reliable method of myocardial protection that may change the way we currently protect the heart intraoperatively. 
1	Glomus tumor of the coccyx. A curable cause of coccygodynia. A 30-year-old woman presented with recurrent severe coccygodynia. She underwent exploration for a possible pilonidal sinus and was found to have a precoccygeal glomus tumor that also involved bony trabeculae of the coccyx. To our knowledge, a glomus tumor involving the coccygeal bone has not been previously documented. In view of the relief of this patient's pain following the surgical excision of coccyx and tumor, a causal role is suggested. 
5	Overexpression of normal and mutated forms of HRAS induces orthotopic bladder invasion in a human transitional cell carcinoma. Recent studies have shown that orthotopic (transurethral) transplantation of human bladder cancer cell lines into nude mice permits tumor growth that accurately reflects their clinical malignant status in the original host. Thus, such a system allows a unique opportunity to analyze the genetic events involved in the conversion of low-grade bladder cancer, the vast majority of which are curable, to the high-grade life-threatening form of the disease. Since 5-10% of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) have been shown to contain a mutated HRAS gene, and protein expression levels of all forms of HRAS have been correlated with TCC progression, we chose to study the contribution of the HRAS oncogene in bladder tumor progression. We evaluated the effects of transfection of normal or mutated HRAS genes into a human TCC, called RT-4, that behaves as a superficial noninvasive papillary tumor after transurethral orthotopic inoculation into athymic nude mice. We found that overexpression of either transfected normal or mutated HRAS genes converted RT-4 cells to express an invasive phenotype remarkably similar in nature to the clinical behavior of high-grade bladder carcinomas. These results suggest a role for overexpressed normal or mutated RAS genes in human bladder carcinoma progression, and highlight the importance of using orthotopic inoculation systems for evaluation of the contribution of oncogenes to malignant tumor progression. 
5	Retrobulbar alcohol injection in blind painful eyes. We studied 39 blind painful eyes in 39 patients who were treated with retrobulbar injection of absolute (96%) alcohol for their severe ocular pain at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital from January 1984 to January 1987. There were 21 (54%) male and 18 (46%) female patients; all were followed for at least three months. The protracted ocular pain was mainly due to: end-stage (absolute) glaucoma in 31 (80%) eyes, uveitis or endophthalmitis in four (10%) eyes, or corneal ulcer in two (5%) eyes. One eye had painful phthisis bulbi, and one eye had infraorbital neuralgia. The complications encountered were transient and included blepharoptosis in eight (21%) eyes, external ophthalmoplegia, and corneal epithelial defect. The effective time of the injection to relieve pain ranged from two weeks to two years (mean, 29 weeks). The authors believe that there is still a place for retrobulbar alcohol injection for blind painful eyes when enucleation or evisceration is not possible. 
5	Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease. CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms. 
5	Clinical significance of intratesticular arterial anatomy. Testicular atrophy has been reported in 2 to 18% of the patients following orchiopexy for cryptorchidism. A possible cause of this atrophy is interference with the testicular blood supply by placement of a testicular traction suture through the tunica albuginea. Arterial casts of 32 adult human testes were created following placement of a 3-zero silk traction suture through the lower pole of the testis to determine the effects of this suture upon intragonadal arterial circulation. Significant arterial blockage, manifested as failure of the parenchymal branches to fill, was observed in 14% of the casts produced via injection through the internal spermatic artery and in 100% of the casts produced via injection through the deferential artery. The results of this study support discontinuing the routine use of parenchymal testicular traction sutures during orchiopexy. 
5	Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for necrotizing fasciitis reduces mortality and the need for debridements. Twenty-nine patients with necrotizing fasciitis were treated from 1980 to 1988. This study evaluates how the addition of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to surgical treatment has affected mortality and the number of debridements required to achieve wound control in these patients. Two groups of patients were viewed: group 1 (n = 12) received surgical debridement and antibiotics only; group 2 (n = 17) received HBO (90 minutes at 2.5 atm, average 7.4 treatments) in addition to surgery and antibiotics. Both groups were similar in age, race, sex, wound bacteriology, and antimicrobial therapy. Body surface area affected was similar, however, perineal involvement was more common in group 2 (53%) than in group 1 (12%). The admitting conditions of patients in group 1 (non-HBO) were diabetic, 33%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 50%; and shock, 8%. The admitting conditions of patients in group 2 (HBO) were diabetic, 47%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 59%; and shock, 29%. Although group 2 patients receiving HBO were more seriously ill on admission, mortality was significantly lower (23%) compared to group 1 (66%) (p less than 0.02). In addition, only 1.2 debridements per group 2 patient were required to achieve wound control versus 3.3 debridements per group 1 patient (p less than 0.03). The addition of HBO therapy to the surgical and antimicrobial treatment of necrotizing fasciitis significantly reduced mortality and wound morbidity (number of debridements) in this study, especially among nonclostridial infections. We conclude that HBO should be used routinely in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. 
1	A pilot study of suramin in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Suramin sodium is an aromatic polysulfonated compound that was originally introduced as an antiparasitic agent in the 1920s. Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule. 
5	Deceptive bizarre stromal cells in polyps and ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical and pathologic features of 33 pseudomalignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract with bizarre stromal cells are reported. Deceptive histologic changes were identified in ulcers of seven patients and in inflammatory polyps of 26. A misdiagnosis of malignant neoplasm was made in six of the 33 patients (three polyps and three ulcers). A history of gastrointestinal bleeding and/or inflammatory bowel disease was common. The bizarre stromal cells were usually distributed beneath the ulcerated mucosa or within granulation tissue. They stained strongly for vimentin in 20 of 23 cases. Some of the bizarre cells also stained for muscle specific actin (seven of 23 cases). The cells appear to be reactive fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Follow-up information obtained on 24 of the 33 patients (including four of the six cases initially diagnosed as malignant) revealed 22 patients to be alive without evidence of a malignant neoplasm (average follow-up, 13 months). Two patients died of other causes. Correct recognition of these bizarre stromal cells in gastrointestinal ulcers and inflammatory polyps will prevent a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall. 
5	Patients' observations of bioprosthetic valve failure: "my heart is honking, doctor". Audible cardiac murmurs are uncommon and may indicate severe native valve dysfunction. In six patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves audible honking systolic murmurs suddenly developed. Doppler echocardiography showed characteristic striated regurgitant signals. At operation each prosthesis had torn cusps. New audible murmurs and striated Doppler signals originating from mitral bioprosthetic valves are indicators of cusp tears. Recognition of this is important because early detection of prosthetic valve dysfunction may improve subsequent surgical outcome. 
5	Smooth muscle cell proliferation and restenosis after stand alone coronary excimer laser angioplasty It has been shown that coronary excimer laser angioplasty can remove atherosclerotic intracoronary tissue. Stand alone coronary excimer laser angioplasty was successfully performed in a 53 year old white man with 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and exertional angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III). The lesion was reduced to a 30% residual stenosis with use of a 1.2 mm and subsequently a 1.8 mm diameter laser catheter. Early follow-up angiography 24 h later revealed persistent patency and unchanged lesion diameter of the target vessel. The patient was free of symptoms during the 2 month follow-up period, but died suddenly while playing in a tennis tournament 63 days after the procedure. Postmortem histologic examination revealed 80% restenosis at the lesion site without plaque disruption or thrombosis. Specific staining of the histologic specimen for smooth muscle cells using alpha-actin revealed significant smooth muscle cell proliferation at the site of coronary excimer laser angioplasty. However, most of the vessel narrowing appeared to be due to underlying fibrotic plaque as a result of insufficient tissue ablation. This was probably related to the size of the currently available catheters, which are too small to create a large channel. 
5	Infiltration of epinephrine in tonsillectomy: a randomized, prospective, double-blind study. A variety of hemostatic agents and techniques have been used in an attempt to reduce intraoperative blood loss and postoperative bleeding in tonsillectomy. The efficacy of most of these substances and techniques has been judged primarily on clinical impressions. Because of the paucity of prospective studies, a randomized, prospective, double-blind study, using the patients as their own controls, was conducted. Ninety-two patients were injected before tonsillectomy in a random, double-blind fashion with normal saline solution in one tonsil and 1:100,000 epinephrine in the other. The blood loss, time of dissection, and postoperative bleeding were recorded separately for each tonsil. Cardiac manifestations were also monitored. The tonsils injected with epinephrine had a statistically significant reduction in blood loss and dissection time when compared with those injected with normal saline. Subjectively, dissection was easier on the epinephrine-injected side. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. Cardiac manifestations of epinephrine were minimal and transient. This study demonstrates that epinephrine is useful in reducing hemorrhage during tonsillectomy and can be used safely with the appropriate inhalation anesthetics. 
5	Leukaemia complicating treatment for Hodgkin's disease: the experience of the British National Lymphoma Investigation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of and risk factors for the development of secondary acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia in patients treated in British National Lymphoma Investigation's studies of Hodgkin's disease since 1970. PATIENTS--2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS--17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. 
2	Further notes on Munchausen's syndrome: a case report of a change from acute abdominal to neurological type. A rare case of Munchausen's syndrome beginning in early childhood is described. The diagnosis of Munchausen's syndrome was made at the age of 29 years, after the symptoms had changed from acute abdominal to neurological complaints, with feigned loss of consciousness, first ascribed to an encephalitis. Insight into the psychopathology of this patient is given by his biography, by assessment of a psychotherapist, who had treated him some years before, and by his observed profile in some psychological tests. 
1	The use of flow cytometry for the prognosis of stage II adjuvant treated breast cancer patients. Characterization of breast cancer cells by histology, flow cytometry, and steroid receptors was performed on 197 Stage II breast node positive cancer patients given adjuvant chemotherapy, plus tamoxifen for patients with positive hormone receptors. Histologic and steroid receptor assays were performed using standard techniques; flow cytometric analysis was performed from paraffin-embedded blocks obtained from the primary tumor. Quality control studies on reproducibility, tissue heterogeneity, and analysis procedures have been included. Of the 197 patients studied, aneuploidy was found in 102 (52%); the median %S value was 8% with a range of 0.4% to 38%. Our results demonstrated that number of positive nodes, receptor status, and grade were of prognostic value. Cell cycle kinetic data were not of independent prognostic value in this series. However, ploidy could differentiate in prognosis in the receptor-negative subgroup. Patients with receptor-negative tumors had a significantly better overall survival if the tumor was diploid in nature. Cell kinetics was not significantly prognostic for either receptor subgroup, although patients with higher %S tended to have better relapse-free and overall survival. This is in disagreement with other studies and may demonstrate that treatment has confounded our results and diminished the ability of flow cytometry data to help predict outcome. 
5	Low-dose aspirin versus anticoagulants for prevention of coronary graft occlusion. The prevention of graft occlusion by aspirin (100 mg/day) or heparin followed by phenprocoumon was investigated in a randomized trial in 235 patients after aortocoronary bypass operation. Aspirin treatment started 24 hours before, and heparin 6 hours and phenprocoumon 2 days after surgery. The results of the vein graft angiography and the clinical outcome 3 months postoperatively did not differ: 22% of 218 vein graft distal anastomoses in the aspirin group and 20% of 272 in the anticoagulant group were occluded. At least 1 occluded distal anastomosis was present in 38% of 74 patients in the aspirin-treated group and in 39% of 86 in the anticoagulant group. Worst-case analysis of all randomized patients showed graft occlusions, cardiovascular complications or lost to follow-up in 42% of 122 aspirin-treated patients compared with 41% of 113 patients treated with anticoagulants. For grafts with endarterectomy the occlusion rate was lower in the aspirin (12% of 49) than in the anticoagulant (22% of 41) group (p less than or equal to 0.05). Increased perioperative blood loss in the aspirin group (1,211 +/- 814 ml in the first 48 hours vs 874 +/- 818 ml in the anticoagulant group [p less than or equal to 0.001]) without a higher reoperation rate indicates effective platelet inhibition with low-dose aspirin. Because occlusion rates were equal but high in these patients with advanced stage of coronary artery disease, a combination of low-dose aspirin and anticoagulation should be investigated to reduce graft occlusion rates further. 
5	Selective prolongation of QRS late potentials by sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs: relation to slowing of ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring Trial (ESVEM) Investigators. Sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have preferential effects on diseased, slowly conducting myocardium, and slowing of tachycardia caused by these drugs may result primarily from further prolongation of conduction time in slowly conducting tissue. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, late potentials detected by signal-averaged electrocardiography (ECG) are thought to arise from slowly conducting ventricular myocardium. This study tested the hypothesis that sodium channel blocking drugs selectively prolong the late potential, or terminal low amplitude signal, portion of the signal-averaged QRS complex and that prolongation of the late potential would correlate with slowing of ventricular tachycardia. Fifty-six drug trials in 32 patients with spontaneous and inducible ventricular arrhythmias were studied. Prolongation of the late potential (11 +/- 15 ms) was significantly greater than prolongation of the initial portion of the QRS complex (4 +/- 9 ms) (p = 0.01). Selective prolongation of the late potential by drugs resulted in significantly greater QRS prolongation detectable by signal-averaged ECG than by standard ECG (p less than 0.0001). In 40 trials in which ventricular tachycardia remained inducible during drug therapy, the increase in induced tachycardia cycle length correlated strongly with the increase in late potential duration (p = 0.005) but not with change in the initial portion of the QRS complex. These data suggest that in patients with ventricular tachycardia, sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have preferential effects on slowly conducting tissue and that drug effect on slowly conducting tissue contributes to prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length. 
4	Effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with angina pectoris and heart failure The effects of captopril and placebo were compared in 18 patients with chronic heart failure and angina pectoris with use of a double-blind crossover trial design. Symptoms were assessed by patient treatment preference, visual analogue scores and nitroglycerin consumption. Exercise performance was assessed using two different treadmill protocols of different work intensity with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and by supine bicycle exercise and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography. Arrhythmias were assessed by 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients generally preferred placebo to captopril, and this appeared to be due to an increase in symptoms of angina with captopril. Treadmill exercise time on a high intensity protocol was shorter with captopril than with placebo; on a low intensity protocol, angina became a more frequent limiting symptom even though overall exercise performance was not changed. The heart rate-blood pressure product was reduced, but largely because of a reduction in blood pressure rather than in heart rate. During supine bicycle exercise, no differences in symptoms, exercise performance, ejection fraction or changes in blood pressure were noted and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced. Captopril does not appear to be clinically useful in alleviating angina pectoris in patients with heart failure, and this effect may be related to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure. Nonetheless, desirable metabolic effects, a reduction in arrhythmias and potential effects on survival require further study of captopril in patients with both angina and heart failure. 
5	Subcutaneous emphysema producing airway compromise after anesthesia for reduction of a mandibular fracture. A case report and review of the literature. Subcutaneous emphysema can occur as the result of trauma, surgery, and anesthesia. A case is presented of extensive subcutaneous emphysema after anesthesia for oral surgical reduction of a mandibular fracture. A discussion of the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of subcutaneous emphysema follows. 
4	Pathogenesis of ischemic necrosis in random-pattern skin flaps induced by long-term low-dose nicotine treatment in the rat. The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated. Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15). However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible. The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers. Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats. It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment. This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature. Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed. 
5	A coproporphyria-like syndrome induced by glipizide. A 49-year-old man with a 1-month history of episodic, severe abdominal pain sought medical attention. The patient's history was remarkable for type II diabetes, for which glipizide therapy had been initiated 2 months earlier. No other medications were being taken at the time the paroxysms of pain began. During the episodes of pain, both examination of the abdomen and abdominal roentgenograms revealed normal findings. Initial assessment, including ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning of the abdomen, upper gastrointestinal and colon roentgenograms, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealed no cause of the pain. Empiric trials of famotidine, sucralfate, and antacids failed to relieve the pain. Both urine and fecal specimens collected after an attack demonstrated substantially increased coproporphyrins. The glipizide regimen was discontinued; 2 months later, the stool coproporphyrins had decreased to normal levels. At follow-up more than 1 year later, the patient had had no recurrence of abdominal pain. Although other orally administered hypoglycemic agents and other sulfa compounds have been reported to precipitate acute attacks of porphyria, to our knowledge this is the first such case associated with glipizide. We suggest that glipizide be added to the list of medications to be avoided in patients with porphyria. 
5	Delayed central nervous system myelination in the sudden infant death syndrome. This study was designed to assess whether development of the central nervous system (CNS) is delayed in victims of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We selected the parameter of myelination because it is a continuously changing and readily accessible marker of CNS development in the SIDS age-range. We assessed myelination blindly in 61 SIDS and 89 autopsy controls. In 62 sites the degree of myelination was visually graded in myelin-stained histological sections on an ordinal scale of 0-4 using the inferior cerebellar peduncle as an internal standard of degree 3. Cases were stratified by postconceptional age at death and SIDS and controls were compared with respect to myelin degree at each site. Significantly delayed myelination (p less than 0.05) occurred in the SIDS group in 25 of the 62 sites examined. Hypomyelination affected fiber systems in which myelination is initiated before or after birth and which myelinate with different tempos and preferentially affect pyramidal and cerebellar (somatomotor) and prefrontal-temporal-limbic (visceromotor) systems. Hypomyelination was not associated with individual clinicopathologic variables in the SIDS group. Somatic growth and brain weight were significantly greater in SIDS than controls. Therefore, we suggest that SIDS is associated with a developmental CNS disorder. Although delayed CNS myelination most likely shares a common antecedent with sudden death and is not its cause, the role of somato- and viscero-motor systems in central cardiorespiratory control and arousal warrants further analysis in SIDS. 
1	Breast cancer and dietary and plasma concentrations of carotenoids and vitamin A. A case-control study of breast cancer was conducted in Buffalo. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and donated a fasting blood sample before definitive workup for breast masses. Dietary and plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol for 83 women found to have breast cancer were compared with those of 113 women found to be free of breast cancer (control subjects). There were no case-control differences in dietary estimates of vitamin A intake or in plasma alpha-carotene and lycopene. However, subjects with breast cancer had lower concentrations of plasma beta-carotene than did control subjects (P = 0.02). There was no overall association between plasma retinol and breast cancer but a positive relationship was observed between retinol and breast cancer in the subgroup with low beta-carotene values. These results suggest that low plasma beta-carotene is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Other studies will need to determine whether low carotene concentrations are a subtle effect of the disease or might be causally related to breast cancer. 
4	Sudden death caused by coronary artery aneurysms: a late complication of Kawasaki disease. The authors describe three cases (two blacks and one Latin American) of sudden death caused by late complications of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). At autopsy each heart contained multiple coronary artery aneurysms with luminal stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia and thrombi. Although virtually all fatal cases of Kawasaki disease occur within six months of the onset of symptoms, there have been other reported deaths up to 14 years after the acute illness. The coronary artery aneurysms of Kawasaki disease may persist and cause death years after the acute illness. 
5	Mutations in src homology regions 2 and 3 of activated chicken c-src that result in preferential transformation of mouse or chicken cells. src homology regions 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) of proteins encoded by src and closely related genes are conserved domains believed to modulate the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of this class of proteins, perhaps through interactions with other proteins. To explore the possibility of using src mutants as probes for such interactions, we have compared mouse NIH 3T3 cells with chicken embryo fibroblasts as host cells for 24 previously described substitution and deletion mutants with lesions in the SH2- and SH3-encoding regions of a transformation-competent allele of chicken c-src. Although several of these mutants are equally competent or equally defective for transformation of the two cell types, four mutants (three of which map within SH3) preferentially transform NIH 3T3 cells, and seven mutants (all of which map within SH2) preferentially transform chicken cells. Some of the SH2 mutants least able to transform mouse cells exhibit augmented transforming activity in chicken cells. In general, the in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activities of the mutants correlated with transforming activities. Thus, in many cases, the catalytic activity of a mutant protein depended upon the host cell in which the protein was made. Such host-dependent mutants may be especially useful reagents for biochemical and genetic studies of the src gene family. 
1	Adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum in patients less than 40 years of age. From 1962 to 1988, 50 of 801 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum treated at the National Naval Medical Center were less than 40 years old. Symptoms were present in 47 of the younger patients at presentation. The mean duration of time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in this group was 4.9 months. Risk factors for carcinoma of the colon and rectum were identified in 14 of 50 patients less than 40 years old. A significantly greater proportion of patients less than 40 years old had Stage C disease compared with the older group of patients (42 versus 22 per cent, p = 0.014). Stage B disease was more common in patients more than 40 years of age (44.8 versus 26.0 per cent, p = 0.014). The proportion of patients with Stages A and D disease was similar in both age groups. The cumulative survival rate in this group at five and ten years was 43 and 34 per cent, respectively. The five year survival rate in patients less than 40 years old with Stage B disease was 76 per cent and with Stage C disease, 37 per cent. All young patients with Stage D disease were dead at 28 months. Synchronous and metachronous carcinomas of the colon and rectum were uncommon in patients less than 40 years old. Patients less than 40 years of age with carcinoma of the colon and rectum are usually symptomatic and have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Survival time for these patients for each stage of disease is similar to the over-all population of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum. 
2	Pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a common but rather poorly understood entity most often associated with alcohol abuse or biliary tract disease. Despite the availability of a variety of diagnostic tests and imaging techniques, the diagnosis of pancreatitis continues to be primarily a clinical one. Of major concern to the emergency physician is distinguishing pancreatitis from other, potentially lethal, causes of abdominal pain, and identifying those patients with severe pancreatitis who are at risk for a complicated course secondary to the remote systemic effects of the disease. 
1	Survival of premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term follow-up of Eastern Cooperative Group and Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies. In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, differences in survival curves early during follow-up can be misleading. The authors therefore analyzed long-term survival in 378 patients, entered in three randomized trials, started between 1973 and 1978. Combined data from the three trials were used to increase the power for identifying prognostic variables. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 7382 randomized patients to oophorectomy plus either cyclophosphamide or combination chemotherapy or observation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2174 randomized patients who had not progressed 3 months after oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy or observation. Trial ECOG 2177 randomized estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER-unknown patients to oophorectomy plus combination chemotherapy or immediate combination chemotherapy, and ER-negative patients were directly assigned to combination chemotherapy. Hence ER-negative patients need not have been healthy enough to be randomized to oophorectomy. With only 14% of the patients still alive, median survival on the three studies was 30, 24, and 28 months. The median survival of individual treatments changed noticeably in ECOG 2174 and ECOG 2177 with long-term follow-up. At this time there are no differences in survival between randomized regimens in any of the three trials. In a multivariate model, factors associated with significantly poorer survival were visceral-dominant disease, nodal metastases, breast metastases, age younger than 45 years, ER negativity, and not receiving chemotherapy immediately after oophorectomy. This treatment difference was thus not due to imbalances in the prognostic variables used in the model, but it may be due to imbalances of unknown prognostic factors or differences in patient selection. 
5	Persistent mullerian duct syndrome. Persistent mullerian syndrome is rare. A case of phenotypically normal male with persistent mullerian structures that consisted of a bicornuate uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina is reported. These unusual structures were found in association with bilateral cryptorchidism and a right inguinal hernia, and were diagnosed while repairing the hernia in the neonatal period. The uterus and fallopian tubes were removed via laparotomy when the child was eighteen months old; at the same time a bilateral orchiopexy was performed. To avoid damage to the vas deferens, which lay in closely to the mullerian structures and could not be separated from the vaginal wall, a small segment of the upper third of the vagina was retained. The testicles, although normal on pathologic examination, have shown poor response to hormonal stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Long-term follow-up for these patients is necessary because they have an increased risk of testicular tumors developing. 
4	A new method of haemodynamic assessment of mitral stenosis in atrial fibrillation: construction of a nomogram. Accurate haemodynamic assessment of mitral stenosis by hydraulic formulas requires measurement of the mean valve gradient and the cardiac output. The calculation is laborious, particularly in the presence of atrial fibrillation when averaged values obtained from multiple beat-to-beat determinations must be used. The relations between valve area, end diastolic gradient, and heart rate in 20 patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation were examined. In each patient the end diastolic pressure gradient for each cardiac cycle was related linearly to the RR interval of that cycle, and this relation was unchanged on exercise. The slope (S) and intercept (I) of this relation correlated with the degree of mitral stenosis as measured by the Gorlin valve area. The regression equations describing these relations were then used to construct a nomogram relating end diastolic pressure gradient to mitral valve area at different heart rates. When the nomogram was applied to catheterisation data from a further 30 patients the results correlated well with direct calculation of valve area by the Gorlin formula. The nomogram is simple to use, does not require measurement of cardiac output, and is independent of heart rate so that it is unnecessary for the patient to exercise during catheterisation. 
5	Etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children from Alabang, Metro Manila. The etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) was identified in 235 (43.8%) of 537 hospitalized children less than 5 years of age. Clinical evidence of measles was found in 258 (48.0%) patients, of whom 59 had a second viral infection. A viral agent was identified in an additional 121 patients, so that a total of 379 (70.6%) had viral infections. After measles, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common respiratory virus. Bacteremia was noted in 72 children (13.4%), occurring as frequently in children with measles (14.8%) as in those without (12.1%); Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella typhi were predominant in the former, and H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were prominent in the latter. The presence of bacterial antigen in urine was not helpful in identifying bacterial infection. Extrapulmonary and intrapleural complications, concomitant measles, complicated ALRI, female gender, and malnutrition were associated with increased mortality among children with ALRI. The importance of measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation for alleviation of defects associated with malnutrition, and timely antimicrobial therapy is emphasized. 
5	Postoperative analgesic requirements in patients exposed to positive intraoperative suggestions. OBJECTIVE--To establish whether positive suggestions given to a patient under general anaesthesia reduce postoperative pain and analgesic requirements. DESIGN--Prospective double blind randomised study. SETTING--Operating theatre and gynaecology ward of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--63 Woman undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomised to be played either a tape of positive suggestions or a blank tape during the operation through a personal stereo system. INTERVENTIONS--Three women were withdrawn from the study. Anaesthesia was standardised for all of the women. Postoperative analgesia was provided through a patient controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours. Pain scores were recorded every six hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Morphine consumption over the first 24 hours after the operation; pain scores. RESULTS--Mean morphine requirements were 51.0 mg (95% confidence interval 42.1 to 60.0 mg in the women played positive suggestions; and 65.7 mg (55.6 to 75.7 mg) in those played a blank tape. The point estimate (95% confidence interval) for the difference of means was 14.6 mg (22.4%) (1.9 (2.9%) to 27.3 mg (41.6%] (p = 0.028). Pain scores were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION--Positive intraoperative suggestions seem to have a significant effect in reducing patients' morphine requirements in the early postoperative period. 
5	Transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus. Poliovirus-sensitive transgenic mice were produced by introducing the human gene encoding cellular receptors for poliovirus into the mouse genome. Expression of the receptor mRNAs in tissues of the transgenic mice was analyzed by using RNA blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction. The human gene is expressed in many tissues of the transgenic mice just as in tissues of humans. The transgenic mice are susceptible to all three poliovirus serotypes, and the mice inoculated with poliovirus show clinical symptoms similar to those observed in humans and monkeys. Rabbit antipoliovirus serum detects the antigens mainly in motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and in nerve cells in the medulla oblongata and pons of the paralyzed transgenic mice. Therefore, cell types sensitive to poliovirus in the central nervous system of the transgenic mice appear to be identical to those of humans and monkeys. Furthermore, many more doses of oral poliovirus vaccine strains than of the virulent strains are required to cause paralysis in the transgenic mice. This may reflect the observation that the virulent strain multiplies more efficiently in the central nervous system than the attenuated strain. Thus, the transgenic mice may become an excellent new animal model to study molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of poliovirus and to assess oral poliovirus vaccines. 
4	Prognostic significance of exercise versus resting blood pressure in hypertensive men. The outcome of 143 male hypertensive patients, investigated in the period 1972-1982, was ascertained in 1989 to determine if brachial artery pressure measured during a progressive graded exercise test on the bicycle ergometer is a better predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events than pressure at rest. During the total follow-up time of 1,573 patient years, 27 patients suffered at least one fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event and 13 patients died. Using the Cox regression model, the age-adjusted relative hazard rates of systolic pressure at supine rest, at 50 W, at peak work load, and at 50% of peak exercise capacity were significant for total mortality (p less than or equal to 0.01) and for cardiovascular events (p less than or equal to 0.03). Pressure during exercise, however, did not significantly (p = 0.11-0.97) predict the outcome of the patients when age and pressure at rest were taken into account. The results were similar for diastolic pressure. In conclusion, intra-arterial pressures at rest and during submaximal and peak exercise significantly predict mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular events in hypertensive men, independent of age. However, there is no additional prognostic precision of the exercise pressures when age and the rest pressure are taken into account. 
1	Intraoperative fine needle aspiration cytology of pancreatic lesions. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the practicality of intraoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 43 patients. The indication for performing this procedure was to determine the nature of pancreatic masses. Conclusive cytologic diagnoses were reached in 41 patients who represent the present study. On the basis of histologic findings in 30 cases (73.2%) and on clinical findings in 11 cases (26.8%), a final diagnosis of malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) was established in 31 and of benign pancreatic disease (BPD) in 10 patients. Among the 31 cases with MPD, the cytologic diagnosis was correct in 30 patients and falsely negative in one patient. Among 10 patients with BPD, all the cytologic finding were reported as benign. The sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values for cytologic findings were 96.8%, 100%, 100%, and 90.9%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytology was 97.6%. No complications followed the procedure. We conclude that intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions is a simple, safe, highly sensitive, and specific tool in differentiating benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. This procedure should be carried out in any patient with pancreatic mass incidentally found at laparotomy or in a patient undergoing surgery because of suspected nonmetastasizing MPD in whom repeated imaging guided FNA failed to demonstrate malignancy. 
5	Mechanisms of gas-exchange impairment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To investigate the mechanisms of pulmonary gas-exchange impairment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to evaluate their potential relationship to the CO diffusing capacity (DLCO), we studied 15 patients with IPF (mean DLCO, 52% of predicted) at rest (breathing room air and pure O2) and during exercise. We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory gas-exchange variables, and we separated the ventilation-perfusion (VAQ) mismatching and O2 diffusion limitation components of arterial hypoxemia using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. At rest VA/Q mismatching was moderate (2 to 4% of cardiac output perfusing poorly or unventilated lung units), and 19% of AaPO2 was due to O2 diffusion limitation. During exercise VA/Q mismatch did not worsen but the diffusion component of arterial hypoxemia increased markedly (40% AaPO2, p less than 0.005). We observed that those patients with higher pulmonary vascular tone (more release of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) showed less pulmonary hypertension during exercise (p less than 0.05), less VA/Q mismatching [at rest (p less than 0.005) and during exercise (p less than 0.0025)], and higher arterial PO2 during exercise (p = 0.01). We also found that DLCO corrected for alveolar volume (KCO) correlated with the mechanisms of hypoxemia during exercise [VA/Q mismatching (p less than 0.025) and O2 diffusion limitation (p less than 0.05)] and with the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance elicited by exercise (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, we showed that the abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature are key to modulate gas exchange in IPF, especially during exercise. 
5	Volumetric atrophy of the amygdala in Alzheimer's disease: quantitative serial reconstruction. The present study quantitatively assessed volumes of the amygdala and its subnuclei in autopsied cases of advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) for comparison with age-matched controls. Amygdalar nuclei showed significant atrophy in AD with the exception of the paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus. The magnocellular regions of the amygdala showed proportionately greater size reductions as a fraction of total amygdala volume than did other areas. Computerized reconstruction of the amygdala provided three-dimensional views of a variety of structural alterations accompanying the volumetric declines with AD. The apparent selective vulnerability of the magnocellular amygdalar areas coincides with the loss of large nerve cells in AD. 
5	A unified hypothesis for the complex genetics of HLA associations with IDDM. Our understanding of the role of HLA genes associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is in disarray, despite recent improvements in the definition of specific alleles and haplotypes. Some genes are highly associated with IDDM, other genes are associated with resistance to IDDM, and some highly associated susceptibility genes are markedly influenced by trans-associated synergistic effects (DR3/4 heterozygotes) or protective effects (DR2/4 heterozygotes). This plethora of genetic associations has spawned the notion that there are many contributing susceptibility genes, which, in turn, has led to the search for shared structural features among different genes on IDDM-associated haplotypes. From a more mechanistic point of view, however, the wide range of variable IDDM associations, with both cis- and trans-encoded protective and/or synergistic effects, suggests a different approach. This article proposes a hypothesis in which the different HLA associations with IDDM can be simply explained by a single unifying concept: a hierarchy of affinities determines the interaction between a diabetogenic peptide and different class II molecules, and an individual is susceptible to IDDM if the class II molecule in that individual with the highest affinity for such a peptide is a DQ beta susceptibility gene. The explicit formulation of this proposal and its genetic implications provide an explanation for HLA-encoded dominant "protection" and for some of the more subtle genetic observations related to cis and trans influences in IDDM susceptibility. 
1	Invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast: mammographic appearance. The mammographic findings in 18 patients with invasive papillary carcinoma were studied retrospectively. The mammograms of 10 patients showed a multinodular pattern, and seven patients had solitary nodules. One patient had an irregular, ill-defined mass in the retroareolar region. Two patients were found to have carcinoma in the contralateral breast, and two patients had intraductal carcinoma adjacent to the invasive papillary carcinoma. The varied mammographic features that may occur with this rare breast malignancy are discussed. 
1	Second cancers following non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The risk of second malignancies following non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was estimated in 29,153 patients diagnosed with NHL between 1973 and 1987 in one of nine areas participating in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Compared with the general population, NHL patients were at a significantly increased risk of developing second cancers (observed/expected [O/E] = 1.18; O = 1231). The O/E ratio increased significantly with time to reach 1.77 in 10-year survivors. Significant excesses were noted for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (O/E = 2.88), cancers of the bladder (O/E = 1.30), kidney (O/E = 1.47), and lung (O/E = 1.57), malignant melanoma (O/E = 2.44), and Hodgkin's disease (O/E = 4.16). Chemotherapy appeared related to subsequent acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and bladder cancer. Radiation therapy was associated with ANLL and possibly cancers of the lung, bladder, and bone. Malignant melanoma was not clearly related to initial NHL treatment. 
5	Quantification of midline shift as a predictor of poor outcome following head injury. A retrospective study of patient outcome, based on admission computed tomography, was carried out in 75 consecutive patients with head injury. Computed tomography data collected included the type and extent of intracranial hemorrhage, the extent of midline shift, and the ratio of midline shift compared with the extent of intracranial hemorrhage. Midline shift was considered to be out of proportion to intracranial hemorrhage when the midline shift of the septum pellucidum exceeded the extent of the hemorrhage as measured radially from the inner table of the skull. When computed tomography data were analyzed by logistic regression, significant predictive factors for poor outcome were intracranial hemorrhage (34%), intracranial hemorrhage with midline shift (61%), and midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage (88%). When patient outcome and mortality rates are considered, our study indicates that midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage is a highly useful predictor of poor patient outcome following head injury. 
5	Topographic mapping of electrophysiologic measures in patients with homonymous hemianopia We analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and spatial distribution of the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP) in 20 patients with unilateral lesions in the retrochiasmal visual pathways. Focal abnormalities that were consistent with lesion location were present in the topographically analyzed EEG or VEP of 85% of the patients, compared with a 70% detection rate for conventional analysis techniques. Quantitative analysis of spectrally analyzed EEG revealed focal abnormality in 7 patients whose conventional EEG was interpreted as either normal or diffusely slow. However, focal paroxysmal spikes present in the EEG of 1 patient were missed by EEG mapping, and a false localization of quantitative EEG abnormality contralateral to the lesion occurred in 1 patient. Topographic analysis of the PVEP was no more sensitive to retrochiasmatic lesions than conventional analysis of 2 lateral occipital electrodes. We conclude that topographic mapping is a valid technique in the detection of localized cerebral lesions. 
5	Abnormal cardiac sensitivity in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries. The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain. The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown. 
1	Risk factors for metastases in patients with retinoblastoma. The study is based upon a review of data from 583 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma over the years 1956 to 1986. Mean follow-up was 8 years, and median was 5.5 years. In 41 patients, metastases developed within 5 years. The influence of clinical and histopathologic risk factors on the occurrence of metastases was first analyzed by univariate tests. Significant variables were then reevaluated using the Cox proportional hazards method. Four factors were found to be independently associated with the development of metastases: optic nerve invasion with and without involvement of the resection line, choroidal invasion and enucleation of an affected eye more than 120 days after initial diagnosis. The 5-year metastatic risks associated with these factors were 67%, 13%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. The relative risk estimate, calculated from the Cox model, was used for a score classification with groups of low, medium, and high metastatic risk. The 5-year incidence of metastases was 4%, 43%, and 68%, respectively. 
4	Sinus arrest induced by trivial nasal stimulation during alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. A case is reported of bradycardia and sinus arrest induced by insertion of a nasal temperature probe. Other possible causes of bradycardia and sinus arrest under anaesthesia are reviewed briefly. Evidence for the neurological basis of a nasocardiac reflex, similar to the oculocardiac reflex, is presented. A minor, trivial stimulus may elicit this reflex. 
4	Dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR: common delays and time standards for delivery. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of bystander CPR before and after implementation of a telephone CPR program in King County; to determine the reasons for dispatcher delays in identifying patients in cardiac arrest in delivering CPR instructions over the telephone; and to suggest time standards for delivery of the telephone CPR message. DESIGN: An ongoing cardiac arrest surveillance system to calculate the annual bystander CPR rates from 1976 through 1988. Two hundred sixty-seven taped recordings of calls reporting cardiac arrests to nine emergency dispatch centers during 1988 were reviewed and timed. SETTING: King County, Washington, excluding the city of Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-seven persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receiving emergency medical services. Arrests in doctors' offices, clinics, or nursing homes were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rate of bystander CPR increased from 32% (1976 through 1981) to 54% (1982 through 1988) after implementation of the dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR program, although an increase in survival could not be demonstrated. The median time for dispatchers to identify the problem was 75 seconds; to deliver the early protocols, 19 seconds; to deliver the ventilation instructions, 25 seconds; and to deliver compression instructions, 30 seconds. The total time to deliver the entire CPR message was 2.3 minutes. The most frequent cause for delay was unnecessary questions (57%) with questions about patient age asked most frequently (32%). Other causes included the caller not being near the patient (29%) and deviations from protocol (22%). CONCLUSION: In a metropolitan emergency medical services system, a dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR program was associated with an increase in bystander CPR. Delays in proper delivery of telephone CPR can be minimized through training. 
5	Autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by deletion at a dinucleotide repeat. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited condition rendering neutrophils incapable of killing invading pathogens. This condition is due to the failure of a multicomponent microbicidal oxidase that normally yields a low-midpoint-potential b cytochrome (cytochrome b245). Although defects in the X chromosome-linked cytochrome account for the majority of CGD patients, as many as 30% of CGD cases are due to an autosomal recessive disease. Of these, greater than 90% have been shown to be defective in the synthesis of a 47-kDa cytosolic component of the oxidase. We demonstrate here in three unrelated cases of autosomal recessive CGD that the identical underlying molecular lesion is a dinucleotide deletion at a GTGT tandem repeat, corresponding to the acceptor site of the first intron-exon junction. Slippage of the DNA duplex at this site may contribute to the high frequency of defects in this gene. 
5	Heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes. An unrecognized problem. Heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes is both unknown to clinicians and a potential source of confusion with metastatic disease. We reviewed the English literature and found 289 cases of heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes. The majority (84%) of these patients were operated on for malignant neoplasms. The most frequent sites of occurrence was the pelvis (67%), followed by the axilla (14%), neck (14%), groin (3%), abdomen (2%), and mediastinum (less than 1%). The tissue seen is site-specific and frequently resembles a neighboring organ. Three cases have been reported in which heterotopic tissue was mistaken for metastatic disease. These cases illustrate the importance of being familiar with heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes and identifying it when it does occur, to avoid inappropriate therapy. 
5	Interval gangrene of the lower extremity: a complication of vascular surgery. Interval gangrene, segmental ischemic necrosis proximal to a functioning distal anastomosis, is a rare complication after successful peripheral vascular reconstruction. Previous reports have demonstrated the gravity of this event in that major limb amputation was required in all cases. Two cases are presented to emphasize the need for maintaining segmental collateral circulation after successful distal extremity bypass. Despite a satisfactory result after distal (inframalleolar) bypass of a popliteal aneurysm, one patient had progressive ischemic gangrene of the upper leg and eventually required amputation. The contralateral limb was successfully managed by distal ligation of the superficial femoral artery, which maintained collateral flow from the proximal superficial femoral artery to the knee and leg. The second patient required a microvascular free flap to replace tissue loss and provide vascular graft coverage after initial multiple bypass failures and a final successful remote reconstruction to the dorsal artery of the foot that excluded the popliteal-crural collateral network. Patients with inadequate collateral circulation or disruption of the profundus or geniculate collateral pathways may require revascularization of sequential vascular beds. Recognition of the potential for interval gangrene is essential since the likelihood of its occurrence will increase in proportion to the number of distal bypasses being performed for limb salvage. Although adjunctive procedures will not completely eliminate the possibility of interval gangrene, awareness of this phenomenon with attention to the segmental collateral circulation can decrease the incidence of its occurrence. 
3	The prolonged burner syndrome. Over the course of a single football season, six players evaluated by the medical staff had burners that displayed a prolonged neurologic recovery. These players were examined and subsequently evaluated with isokinetic testing and electrodiagnostic studies to elucidate better the short-term natural history of the prolonged burner syndrome. Evidence of muscular weakness at 72 hours postinjury best correlated with positive electrodiagnostic findings. No correlation was found between the initial physical examination findings and the results of electrodiagnostic testing. Isokinetic strength evaluation demonstrated many relative strength differences that were difficult to discern with manual muscle testing. The return of a player to athletic competition following this injury should largely be based on the clinical examination. 
4	Medicinal leeches: once again at the forefront of medicine. Medical grade leeches have recently been used in the management of acute problems relative to venous congestion in patients with traumatic injuries and surgical problems. Specific cases, especially in the realm of reconstructive microsurgery, have demonstrated the effectiveness and application of leech therapy. Specific contraindications include arterial insufficiency from either anatomic or mechanical obstruction. We present five illustrative cases of successful therapeutic intervention. 
5	On the metallothionein, glutathione and cysteine relationship in rat liver. Stress and starvation increased liver metallothionein (MT) and decreased liver glutathione (GSH) levels. Serum cysteine plus cystine levels were increased by stress. The exogenous administration of GSH, while not modifying hepatic GSH content, increased liver MT levels in basal and starved rats but not in stressed rats. Liver and serum cysteine levels were increased by GSH administration, a process partially reverted by the irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid. Mouse and rat liver MT levels were also increased by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, indicating that GSH is not a necessary precursor of MT. In addition, the hepatic MT content was increased by the administration of cysteine in a dose-response manner. These results suggest that hepatic MT synthesis is elevated by increased cysteine pools, and that MT, GSH and cysteine levels are somehow inter-related. MT, besides GSH, may be contemplated as a putative intracellular reservoir of cysteine in the liver of adult rats. 
1	Prospective study of early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. We prospectively monitored 140 cirrhotic patients for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma for 6 yr, using periodical screening by high-resolution convex-array ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein. Twenty-eight patients were positive for HBs antigen, 26 patients had received blood transfusions and were negative for HBs antigen and 26 patients had a history of heavy drinking. We detected hepatocellular carcinoma in 40 patients during this period. The overall cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the 6 yr was 39%; the cumulative incidence was 59% in patients with HBsAg, 53% in patients who had had blood transfusions and were negative for HBsAg and 22% in patients who had a history of heavy drinking and who were without HBsAg. Detection of the carcinoma in 85% of these 40 patients was based on results of ultrasonography. Twenty-six of the patients (65%) had a small hepatocellular carcinoma of 2 cm or less. alpha-Fetoprotein levels were lower than 100 ng/ml in 56% of these 40 patients. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially patients with HBsAg or with a history of blood transfusion who are negative for HBsAg. Periodic monitoring by use of ultrasonography in particular is recommended for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	Global and molecular hemostatic markers in acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia have multiple hemostatic and thrombotic complications, which may or may not result from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Previous studies incorporating routine coagulation analyses failed to detect any clinically useful information in most of these patients. In this study, the first comprehensive evaluation of the various aspects of the hemostatic system in a population of patients with acute myeloid leukemia was performed. Eighteen patients (23-71 years of age) were studied at either diagnosis or relapse. Hemostatic studies were performed at onset and on days 3, 7, and 30 after initiation of therapy. The bone marrow blast counts ranged from 8% to 98%; prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time showed only minor prolongations in a few of these patients. However, in all patients measurement of platelet-associated markers revealed elevated platelet factor 4 and thromboxane B2 and normal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels. Fibrinolytic markers showed an increase in D-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator and a decrease in alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. Plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and fibrinogen levels were normal. Coagulation markers demonstrated a decrease in protein C and antithrombin III levels and an elevation of the thrombin-antithrombin complex. The pretreatment values for all hemostatic markers studied were similar to the values obtained on days 3, 7, and 30 during treatment. This investigation demonstrated a subclinical activation of the components of the hemostatic system possibly leading to a hypercoagulable state. Although only six patients (33%) experienced hemorrhagic complications, the risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis was strongly evident in all patients. The significance of finding abnormal levels of specific molecular markers of hemostasis will be established in the future application of such markers in clinical evaluations of leukemic patients known to be at risk for coagulation disorders. 
3	Regional variation in brain lactate in Leigh syndrome by localized 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Localized water-suppressed 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in an 11-month-old infant with Leigh syndrome. Spectra obtained from the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and brainstem showed elevations in lactate, which were most pronounced in regions where abnormalities were seen with routine T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This approach has allowed us to examine metabolism in brain tissue directly and noninvasively, and may provide a sensitive means for evaluating metabolic disease and the response to therapy in the brain. 
1	Oncologic imaging. Staging and follow-up of renal and adrenal carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) has emerged from the 1980s to play a dominant role in the pretreatment staging of renal and adrenal carcinomas. For detection, definition (staging), and determination of resectability or recurrence, CT with intravenous contrast enhancement, and more recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA, may be the only cross-sectional imaging studies required before institution of appropriate therapy. Carcinoma of the kidney is frequently diagnosed by serendipity or detected on incidental ultrasound or CT examinations. Real-time ultrasound and color flow Doppler offer unique information on tumor vascularity and major venous vascular involvement. Positive predictive values of 96% can be achieved for the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma using contrast-enhanced CT scanning. For follow-up CT and MRI are the best imaging techniques for evaluation of the retroperitoneum. MRI may distinguish tumor recurrence from fibrosis in selected cases. Because primary neoplasms of the adrenal gland are rare and often exceed 10 cm at the time of initial diagnosis, the functional nature (endocrine) of adrenal carcinoma may be part of the clinical presentation. Because initial stage is critical to survival and extent of surgical therapy, a knowledge of tumor classification is essential to the optimal diagnostic evaluation. Newer imaging tests, CT and MRI, have superseded conventional urography, ultrasound, and radionuclide studies for the diagnosis and staging of adrenal cancer. Early diagnosis and low stage at presentation are critical to survival in patients with adrenal carcinoma. The current concepts for pretreatment imaging evaluation and the role of CT, MRI, and ultrasound are outlined. An oncologic imaging approach based on tumor staging and classification for patients with real or suspected renal cell carcinoma and adrenal carcinoma is essential to optimal patient care. 
5	Bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture in a patient with jumper's knee. This is the fourth case report of bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture as a result of indirect trauma in a patient without systemic disease. This is the only report we have found of jumper's knee leading to simultaneous infrapatellar tendon ruptures. 
5	Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. 
3	A multicentre follow-up study of 1152 patients with myasthenia gravis in Italy. A multicentre retrospective study was carried out on the characteristics and course of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Italy. Data from 1152 patients, fairly representative of the myasthenic population seeking medical advice, were analysed for diagnostic criteria, clinical aspects and therapeutic approaches. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up, 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%, remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms, the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%, mostly in women, younger than age 40, and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease, mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus. MG was lethal in 4% of patients, principally men, older than 40, in grade 3 or worse at first observation, with a short history of disease, and with thymona. 
5	Development and validation of an index for scoring baseline respiratory disease in the very low birth weight neonate. Severity Index Development and Validation Panels and Newborn Lung Project. An accurate description of the population at risk for neonatal chronic lung disease is clearly of prime importance for comparative studies and the planning of interventions. Attempts to explain variations in chronic lung disease rates in such studies have been compromised by lack of a way of estimating the severity of the initial pulmonary disease as a risk factor. Therefore, a severity index was developed for use in very low birth weight (less than 1501 g) neonates. Special emphasis was placed on applicability of the index in the multicenter observational setting. Development followed a clinician panel approach, with the resulting index designed to capture clinical judgment of severity. The index was validated prospectively on neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit, and retrospectively using charts from nine hospitals nationwide. Correlations of the index with clinical judgment in the two samples were .95 and .93, respectively. In an additional validation the index combined with birth weight correctly predicted oxygen dependence status at 30 days in 36 of 42 neonates consecutively admitted to five neonatal intensive care units (P = .002). Birth weight and the severity index contributed about equally to the prediction, and therefore they seem to represent partly independent components of baseline propensity for prolonged oxygen dependence. 
4	Assessment of experimental pericardial effusion using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging techniques. An experimental canine model of pericardial effusion was designed to validate previous clinical nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) studies. Saline (n = 7), serum (n = 4), blood (10% hematocrit [n = 5]; 20% hematocrit [n = 5]), and lipid (n = 4) effusions were chosen to resemble: (1) transudative/exudative, (2) nonhemorrhagic/hemorrhagic, and (3) chylous effusions, respectively. There was a linear correlation between the infused volume and the pericardial/epicardial distance measurements on the nuclear magnetic resonance images. Hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic exudative effusions were distinguished from transudative effusions by the low signal intensity of transudative effusions images obtained at a TR (repetition time) of 400 and 800 msec. Nonhemorrhagic effusions had significantly lower effusion-to-myocardial signal intensity ratio at TR of 400 msec than did hemorrhagic effusions. Differences in hematocrit were not appreciated qualitatively or quantitatively. Compared with other effusion types, only chylous effusions were hyperintense to myocardium at a TR of 400 msec. Chylous effusions were further uniquely characterized by a decreasing effusion-to-myocardial signal intensity ratio with increasing TR. These experimental findings corroborate the findings of earlier clinical reports and suggest that NMR can provide important assistance in the evaluation of pericardial effusions. 
1	Reconstruction after mastectomy. Advances in materials and techniques, especially those involving transposition of muscle and skin flaps, have made breast reconstruction possible for most women who undergo mastectomy for breast cancer. The availability of this option can alleviate the breast and chest wall deformity that results from virtually all local treatment of breast cancer. It is essential that the reconstruction surgeon be part of the breast cancer management team from the beginning of treatment planning and that this surgeon work closely with the general surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation therapist as well as the adjunctive treatment team members. The patient's clinical status and the type of local treatment will be significant determinants of the reconstructive options. For women with stage I breast cancer, these decisions may be based largely on the oncologist's local and adjunctive therapy procedures and the woman's desire to proceed or delay. For women with systemic disease, all members of the breast management team may need to agree on the advisability and timing of reconstruction. Central to all of the numerous decisions described in this paper regarding the timing, type, and extent of breast reconstruction is the primary goal of the entire team: the best possible management of the breast cancer itself. The promise of attractive, symmetric, and natural appearing breasts, complete with a symmetric nipple-areolar complex, has eased somewhat the diminishment of self-esteem and the threat to femininity that can accompany the loss of a breast. By lowering fear, the widely recognized availability of breast reconstruction may encourage more women to monitor their breasts and seek diagnosis of changes and may influence selection of the type of local treatment if cancer is detected. Because of the psychological and cultural significance of the breast, the reconstructive surgeon must be particularly sensitive to the psychological and aesthetic expectations of the patient. Even in those patients with metastases and limited life expectancy, breast reconstruction can enhance the quality of life. 
5	Hepatocyte transplantation into the lung for treatment of acute hepatic failure in the rat. The lung was investigated as a matrix for transplanted hepatocytes in the rat model. Surgically induced fulminant hepatic failure was successfully treated by injection of 5 to 7 x 10(7) isolated hepatocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma in 86% of the animals. No animal, however, survived injection of hepatocytes into the jugular vein. It was found that liver failure is a prerequisite for the intrapulmonary survival of hepatocytes. After regeneration of the native liver, the majority of hepatocytes are cleared away within 6 months. 
4	Recent changes in the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease by the Oxford Regional Vascular Service. Over the four years from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1988, 192 patients were treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease by the Oxford Regional Vascular Service. The number of patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty increased from two in the first year of the study to 34 in the third year of the study. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of patients treated by aortobifemoral bypass but the proportion of patients treated by extra-anatomic bypass remained constant at around 30 per cent. Twice as many patients were treated in the fourth year as in the first year of the study so that the number of surgical operations increased despite many patients being treated exclusively by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The number of patients requiring mandatory treatment for limb salvage increased by 109 per cent and optional treatment for intermittent claudication by 85 per cent. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in Oxford has coincided with an increase in the number of patients presenting with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease and has allowed twice as many people to be treated while the number of aortobifemoral bypass operations has remained unchanged. It is concluded that the introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has not only generated its own workload but has also led to an increased demand for surgical reconstruction for aortoiliac occlusive disease. 
1	Rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia Analyses of cancer incidence data from nine areas of the United States revealed steadily rising rates from 1976 to 1987 of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. The increases among men in this period ranged from 4% to 10% per year, and thus exceeded those of any other type of cancer. In contrast, there were relatively stable trends for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and slight declines for adenocarcinoma of more distal portions of the stomach. Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia disproportionately affected white men and rarely occurred among women. By the mid-1980s, among white men, adenocarcinomas accounted for about one third of all esophageal cancers, while cardia cancers accounted for about one half of all stomach cancers with specified subsites. The rising incidence rates and similar demographic patterns point to the need for investigation into the causes of these poorly understood cancers. 
5	Response of plasma endorphins, corticotropin, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone in the corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test in eumenorrheic and amenorrheic athletes. We compared pituitary response in the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test between 9 eumenorrheic and 10 amenorrheic endurance athletes. The maximal oxygen capacity (VO2max), determined using an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, was larger in amenorrheic (62.7 +/- 1.0 SE mL/min per kg) than in eumenorrheic (54.7 +/- 2.3 mL/min per kg) athletes. A 100 micrograms bolus of human CRH was administered intravenously, and blood samples were collected at -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. The mean basal concentrations of endorphins, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol did not show significant differences between the groups. The cumulative response of ACTH in the CRH test was larger in eumenorrheic (7.7 +/- 1.3 pmol/L) than in amenorrheic (3.6 +/- 0.6 pmol/L) athletes, but the response of endorphins and cortisol did not differ between the groups. A negative correlation was found between the VO2max and the ACTH response during the CRH test in the total group of athletes. These findings indicated changes in the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in amenorrheic athletes that can be attributed to intensive training. 
1	Is there a place for conservative surgery in the treatment of renal carcinoma? Since 1981, 31 patients have undergone conservative surgery for malignant renal tumours and have been followed up for at least 2 years. The techniques included enucleation or resection (wedge resection or partial nephrectomy). In 10 patients the indications for kidney-sparing surgery were absolute, while in the remainder the conservative surgical approach was a deliberate choice. The tumours varied in diameter from 1.3 to 12 cm and no metastases were detected on pre-operative screening. One patient died post-operatively from myocardial infarction. In the remaining 30 there were no local recurrences. Two patients died from skeletal metastases (1 with bilateral malignancy) and 2 underwent surgery in the post-operative period for haemorrhagic complications. The efficacy of conservative surgery in the local control of renal cancer is an argument in favour of its wider use. 
3	Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS. 
2	Omeprazole enhances the efficacy of pancreatin (pancrease) in cystic fibrosis. We studied the effect of the addition of omeprazole (20 mg once a day) to treatment with pancreatin (Pancrease, Cilag, Herentals, Belgium), two or four capsules three times a day, on fecal fat excretion in a double-blind, crossover fashion in nine patients with cystic fibrosis having persistent steatorrhea while taking Pancrease, two capsules three times a day (mean fecal fat excretion, 22.3%; range, 12% to 44%). Neither doubling of the dose of Pancrease nor addition of omeprazole to the lower dose of Pancrease significantly reduced fecal fat excretion (mean, 19.6% [range, 10% to 34%]; mean, 16.4% [range, 6% to 32%], respectively). However, addition of omeprazole to the higher dose of Pancrease (four capsules three times a day) significantly reduced fecal fat excretion when compared with the two doses of Pancrease alone (mean, 10.7%; range, 4% to 25%; P less than 0.01). We conclude that adjunct therapy with omeprazole reduces fecal fat excretion in cystic fibrosis provided that a high dose of Pancrease is supplied. 
5	Spontaneous rupture of the stomach in an adult. We have reported a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in an adult. Immediate onset of severe upper abdominal pain after overindulgence in food and drink along with radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum and the clinical findings of massive abdominal distention, epigastric tenderness, shock, and occasionally subcutaneous emphysema should suggest the possibility of gastric rupture. The treatment is simple, but mortality is high when surgical intervention is not rapid. 
5	Management of hemorrhagic complications from preoperative embolization of arteriovenous malformations. Endovascular embolization procedures have undergone dramatic evolution and improvement in recent years. Despite these advances, controversy remains regarding the optimal role of these procedures in treating cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) and whether their purpose should be as a presurgical adjunct or as primary therapy. This controversy risks fragmentation between disciplines in the broader efforts to improve management of cerebrovascular disorders. The authors report seven cases of life-threatening hemorrhages that occurred during staged invasive therapy for AVM's which illustrate the value of a unified team approach to optimize patient care. Each patient underwent at least one embolization procedure using polyvinyl alcohol particles, followed in two cases by the occlusion of proximal feeding vessels by platinum microcoils and in one case by the attempted detachment of an endovascular balloon. In three patients, catheter penetration into the subarachnoid space resulted in subarachnoid hemorrhage. One patient suffered rupture of a large feeding vessel during balloon inflation. The final three patients sustained intracranial hemorrhage 2 hours, 8 hours, and 5 days, respectively, following embolization. All but two patients underwent emergency craniotomy at the time of the complication. These cases underscore the advantages of interdisciplinary management optimizing decision-making and providing expeditious care when life-threatening complications develop. 
5	Congenital myasthenia associated with facial malformations in Iraqi and Iranian Jews. A new genetic syndrome. Fourteen Jewish patients from 10 families of either Iraqi or Iranian origin with congenital myasthenia had associated facial malformations which included an elongated face, mandibular prognathism with class III malocclusion and a high-arched palate. Other common features were muscle weakness restricted predominantly to ptosis, weakness of facial and masticatory muscles, and fatigable speech; mild and nonprogressive course; response to cholinesterase inhibitors; absence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor; decremental response on repetitive stimulation at 3 Hz but no repetitive compound muscle action potential in response to a single nerve stimulus. This newly recognized form of congenital myasthenia with distinctive ethnic clustering and associated facial malformations is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder. The facial abnormalities may be secondary to the neuromuscular defect or may be primary and unrelated. Further studies are needed to elucidate the defect in neuromuscular transmission responsible for the pathogenesis of this syndrome. 
4	Drug therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias: how many electropharmacologic trials are appropriate? To determine how many electropharmacologic drug trials should be performed to select therapy for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the outcome of 150 consecutive patients with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias undergoing serial electropharmacologic testing was examined. The probability of identifying predicted effective therapy (inductive of fewer than five ventricular responses with three ventricular extrastimuli at three pacing cycle lengths) and the probability of that therapy preventing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia recurrences were determined as a function of the number of preceding trials. The probability ( +/- SE) of identifying predicted effective therapy by the first trial (0.23 +/- 0.03) was significantly higher than that of the second (0.09 +/- 0.04), third (0.08 +/- 0.04) and fourth (0.05 +/- 0.04) trials (p = 0.001). No patient had predicted effective therapy identified by subsequent trials. The 2 year actuarial probability of freedom from sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias on predicted effective therapy was higher for the first (0.79 +/- 0.08), second (0.73 +/- 0.13) and third (0.86 +/- 0.13) trials than for the fourth (0.33 +/- 0.27) trial (p = 0.02). Thus, the probability of selecting therapy with long-term efficacy was highest for the first trial (0.18), intermediate for the second (0.07) and third (0.07) trials and lowest for the fourth (0.02) and subsequent (0.00) trials. Accordingly, the electropharmacologic approach to therapy selection should be abandoned after three unsuccessful trials. 
3	The influence of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus on immediate and 3-month morbidity and mortality after acute stroke. Fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations were determined in 304 consecutive subjects admitted with acute stroke, within 48 hours of ictus. Based on the medical history and these results, subjects were divided into known diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, subjects with stress hyperglycemia, and nondiabetics. The type of stroke was classified as lacunar infarct, cerebral infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage, based on clinical examination by a neurologist and computed tomographic brain scan and/or autopsy. Immediate and 3-month outcomes were examined in relation to (1) fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine levels by stroke subtypes, and (2) glucose tolerance categories by stroke subtypes. A high fasting glucose level was associated with an increased mortality, but this was observed only among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but not diabetics, had increased mortality. In spite of having similar glucose concentrations to those patients with stress hyperglycemia, diabetics did not have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. It is concluded that the association between glucose concentration and outcome is a reflection of stress relating to stroke severity, rather than a direct harmful effect of glucose on damaged neurons. 
4	Transcatheter treatment of splenic artery aneurysms (SAA). Report of two cases. Splenic artery embolization with steel coils was performed in two patients who both had large splenic artery aneurysms and hepatic cirrhosis complicated by hypersplenism. A good clinical effect was noticed after the procedure. It was concluded that this treatment is safe and effective and decreases the risk of splenic artery rupture. It also corrects hypersplenism. Transcatheter embolization appears to be a preferable alternative to surgery in such cases. 
2	The abdominal trauma index--a critical reassessment and validation. The Abdominal Trauma Index (ATI) was devised to quantify the risk of complications following abdominal trauma. With scores greater than 25, the risk of postoperative complications became exponential. The purpose of the present study was to determine if: 1) the organ risk factors previously assigned were more statistically valid; and 2) the addition of physiologic variables would enhance the prediction of postinjury intra-abdominal sepsis. Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
3	Infarction in the territory of the medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. We report 10 cases of cerebellar infarction in the territory of the medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (mPICA). Axial sections on MRI through the middle of the medulla and the cerebellum showed the infarction as a triangular area with a dorsal base and a ventral apex directed towards the fourth ventricle. The infarct also involved the lateral and dorsal medulla when the mPICA supplied all or part of these regions. Three clinical patterns were observed: 1) pseudolabyrinthine signs with or without dysmetria and ataxia when the medulla was spared; marked axial lateropulsion was present in most cases; 2) complete or incomplete Wallenberg's syndrome, when the medulla was involved; 3) silent infarction. These syndromes are precisely those previously attributed to PICA occlusion without distinction of the branch involved. No alteration of consciousness was recorded and spontaneous recovery was the rule. Cerebellar infarction in the distribution of the mPICA can be regarded as a benign condition with a good prognosis. 
4	Late deaths after treatment for childhood cancer. An investigation of 749 deaths occurring among 4082 patients surviving at least five years after the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Britain before 1971 has been undertaken. Of the 738 with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: recurrent tumour, 550 (74%), a second primary tumour, 61 (8%), a medical condition related to treatment of the tumour, 49 (7%), an traumatic death unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 34 (5%), finally, any other cause unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 44 (6%). Less than 10% of five year survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, or a soft tissue sarcoma died of recurrent tumour during the next 15 years, while more than 25% of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's tumour died of recurrent tumour during the corresponding period. Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours. 
4	Protective effect of increased glycolytic substrate against systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased coronary resistance from prolonged global underperfusion and reperfusion in isolated rabbit hearts perfused with erythrocyte suspensions. Current therapy of myocardial infarction may include early reperfusion. We simulated myocardial perfusion conditions during evolving myocardial infarction in isolated, normothermic, isovolumic rabbit hearts perfused with buffer containing bovine red blood cells (hematocrit of 40%), and we assessed the effects of high levels of glucose and insulin as "therapy" during prolonged (150-minute) severe underperfusion and reperfusion. Protocol 1 consisted of underperfusion at a constant coronary perfusion pressure of 8 mm Hg. The control group (n = 8) received 5.5 mmol/l glucose and 15 microunits/ml insulin; the group treated with high levels of glucose and insulin (G + I) (n = 8) received 19.5 mmol/l glucose and 250 microunits/ml insulin during both underperfusion and reperfusion. Relative to the control group, the G + I group experienced 1) greater developed pressure during underperfusion and increased recovery during reperfusion, 2) preserved diastolic function during underperfusion and reperfusion, 3) lower coronary resistance and greater coronary flow during the underperfusion period, 4) increased glycolytic flux and preserved glycogen stores and high energy phosphate levels, and 5) less loss of myocyte enzymes (creatine kinase and alanine aminotransferase). In protocol 2, coronary flow was kept identical in control (n = 8) and G + I hearts (n = 8) during the underperfusion period, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was kept below 10 mm Hg in both groups to minimize subendocardial damage and vascular compression. In this protocol, the effect of the G + I intervention in the prevention of an increase in coronary resistance during the underperfusion period was distinguished from its myocellular metabolic effects; the high G + I substrate had protective effects on mechanical and metabolic function that were less marked than, but similar to, those in protocol 1, indicating that its mechanisms of protection during underperfusion affected both cardiac function and coronary resistance. We conclude that the G + I intervention, in clinically relevant concentrations, markedly protected severely underperfused myocardium for 150 minutes and may be a beneficial intervention in combination with reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction. 
2	Studies on autoimmunity for initiation of beta-cell destruction. VII. Evidence for antigenic changes on beta-cells leading to autoimmune destruction of beta-cells in BB rats. The diabetic syndrome in BioBreeding (BB) rats is believed to result from the destruction of beta-cells by autoimmune responses. However, the initial events that cause the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells remain largely unknown. This investigation was initiated to see whether there are any antigenic changes on the beta-cells from neonatal to adult BB rats that may lead to the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells. Pancreatic grafts from neonatal BB rats remained largely intact without insulitis when transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of acutely diabetic BB rats. Similarly transplanted islet grafts from neonatal BB rats were also not subject to autoimmune destruction. In contrast, islet grafts obtained from adult BB rats, which had been treated with silica to prevent insulitis, were rapidly destroyed in diabetic recipients. These results indicate that beta-cells from neonatal BB rats are different from beta-cells from adult BB rats, at least regarding their recognition by immunologic effectors. Considering our observations and previous information on the initial role of macrophages/dendritic cells in the development of insulitis in BB rats, we suggest that beta-cell-specific antigenic changes that precede insulitis may result in the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells in BB rats. 
1	Pulmonary malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Presentation with fever and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A 64-year-old man presented with protracted fever, hyponatremia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was established. The absence of pulmonary infiltrates precluded any lung biopsy. Autopsy revealed malignant angioendotheliomatosis involving multiple organs including the alveolar septa and pulmonary vasculature. An early diagnosis of MAE in the setting of fever and SIADH may be possible via transbronchial biopsy. 
5	Optimal interpretation of the supine exercise electrocardiogram in patients with right bundle branch block. A detailed analysis of the exercise ECG was performed in 82 patients with right bundle branch block who underwent supine exercise equilibrium radionuclide angiography. The sensitivity and specificity of each individual electrocardiographic lead for the detection of a positive radionuclide angiogram was determined. Leads V5 and V6 had a sensitivity of 58 percent and a specificity of 89 percent. The limb leads and lead V4 had a lower sensitivity, but an equivalent specificity. Leads V1 and V3 each had a clearly lower specificity that ranged from 56 to 67 percent. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the optimal interpretation of the exercise ECG included the limb leads and V4 to V6, but not V1 to V3. The results of coronary angiography in the subset of 16 patients who underwent this procedure confirmed these findings. 
5	Endocapsular hematoma. Description and treatment of a unique form of postoperative hemorrhage. Endocapsular hematoma, to our knowledge, is a previously unreported type of postoperative hemorrhage. In this condition, blood collects in the narrow space between the anterior surface of the posterior capsule and the posterior optic surface of a posterior chamber intraocular lens. Endocapsular hematoma differs from anterior chamber hyphema in several ways: the location of the blood is in the endocapsular space, a small amount of endocapsular blood can cause visually disabling symptoms, the blood in the endocapsular space often fails to reabsorb, and neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy can be used to drain the endocapsular blood into the vitreous cavity. We present six cases of endocapsular hematoma. Neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy was successfully used to drain the endocapsular hematoma in three of these cases. 
2	Treatment of renal colic by prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors and avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic). In a study of the pain-relieving effect of 3 drugs commonly used to treat acute renal colic in this hospital, intravenous indomethacin and intramuscular diclofenac (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors) were compared with intravenous Avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic). As first-line analgesics, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, if given intravenously, offer an effective alternative to Avafortan. Of 145 patients studied, 32 required a second injection for complete relief of pain. Administering a second dose of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors resulted in equally significant pain relief rate even though the route was intramuscular. 
1	Soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck in adults. We reviewed the clinical records and pathologic material of 176 adults with primary soft tissue sarcomas treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1950 and 1985. Seventy-two patients (41%) had low-grade sarcomas and 104 (59%) had high-grade sarcomas. All but 18 patients underwent some form of excision as initial therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with surgical excision showed no significant effect. A significantly increased risk of treatment failure was associated with large tumor size, positive surgical margins, bone involvement, local recurrence, metastatic spread, and high histologic grade. Except for recurrence, the p value by univariate analysis in the log-rank test for comparison of survival according to these clinical and pathologic characteristics was p less than 0.0001. Although the overall survival was 75% at 2 years, 55% at 5 years, and 46% at 10 years, only 20% of the patients with high-grade sarcomas were alive 10 years after treatment. Most patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, high-grade peripheral nerve tumor, and high-grade fibrous histiocytoma and all patients with high-grade angiosarcoma died of disease less than 5 years after diagnosis. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the survival of adult patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck. 
1	The relationship of pemphigus to neoplasia. A statistically increased incidence of malignancy has been observed in patients with pemphigus. A review of the literature reveals 42 cases of nonthymic malignancies and 18 cases of thymic malignancies. A significant predominance of men, with mean age at onset of 50 years, was observed. Pemphigus vulgaris is more common in patients with nonthymic neoplasms, whereas pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus erythematosus and pemphigus vulgaris are equally common in patients with thymic neoplasms. Lymphoreticular malignancies, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, are most frequently observed. The majority of patients with nonthymic neoplasms have pemphigus before the detection of the malignancy and have a favorable 5-year survival rate after tumor resection. The majority of the patients with thymic neoplasms have a thymoma before the development of pemphigus. In some patients pemphigus develops after thymectomy and myasthenia gravis is often associated. Overall, 37 of the 60 patients, or 61%, had a neoplasm of the immune system. 
2	Colonic stenoses: use of oral barium when retrograde flow is completely obstructed on barium enema studies. Forty patients with complete obstruction to retrograde barium flow on barium enema examinations, without clinical or radiographic evidence of obstruction, were studied further with orally administered barium in the same session. All patients had undergone aborted double-contrast barium enema studies and had received antispasmodics intramuscularly before the examination. The authors describe the technique, as well as the clinical and radiologic findings, that allows the safe ingestion of oral barium in patients with stenotic lesions of the colon. In all patients, oral barium passed through the small bowel and the stenotic site in an average of 148 minutes, with no complications. In seven patients, there were synchronous lesions in the colon and small bowel, and the findings were determined better with oral barium studies in 19 patients. If a barium enema study is done and retrograde passage of barium is obstructed by a lesion in the left side of the colon, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by giving the patients oral barium. This practice is safe if precise criteria are applied. 
5	Education and epilepsy: assessment and remediation. Learning difficulties in children with epilepsy may be caused by brain damage and should be investigated. In many cases, however, seizures and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) findings are the only signs of pathology. Frequency and type of seizures may be determining factors that should, if necessary, be evaluated by long-term EEG monitoring, preferably during school performance or in conjunction with neuropsychological assessment. This may prove that subclinical epileptiform discharges in the EEG can adversely affect the child's performance. Secondary psychological problems in epilepsy patients, combined with side effects of antiepileptic drugs, may cause or heighten learning problems. Prophylactic control of seizures with one appropriate drug may alleviate learning problems. Computerized neuropsychological testing with simultaneous EEG recording may reveal the influence of epileptiform discharges on cognitive function and also help to evaluate the effects of antiepileptic drugs. Objective assessment of subclinical epileptiform activity makes it easier to treat the pathology identified by the EEG with optimal dosage of the most appropriate drug. A balance is required because epileptiform discharges and even occasional seizures may be less disabling than side effects from large doses of several drugs. Information to the school and the parents concerning the patient's abilities and limitations may be as important as seizure control. Specialized teaching should be started early, when necessary, with the patient integrated into a normal school if possible. However, good functioning in a special school is preferable to marginal functioning in a normal school. 
4	Effect of cyclosporin on generalized Shwartzman reaction in diabetic rats. The effect of cyclosporin (CsA) on the endotoxin-induced generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR) was studied in diabetic and nondiabetic rats. After 4.5 wk of diabetes, CsA (20 mg/kg) or intralipid as a control substance was given intraperitoneally daily for 10 days. Next, diabetic rats were given either high-dose (2 mg/kg or low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) endotoxin (Escherichia coli 026:B6 lipopolysaccharide B) as a single injection. The rats were killed at intervals of 1, 4, 8, and 24 h. No significant glomerular thrombi were seen in the nondiabetic control animals, whereas the severity of glomerular thrombi in the diabetic animals was dependent on the presence or absence of CsA, endotoxin dose, and degree of glycemic control. In the diabetic rats, glomerular thrombi occurred maximally at 4 h but were no longer present at 24 h. The CsA/high-dose-endotoxin rats had fewer glomerular thrombi than rats receiving the intralipid/high-dose endotoxin, but this difference was not statistically significant. The CsA/low-dose-endotoxin rats had increased glomerular thrombi compared with the intralipid/low-dose-endotoxin rats (P less than 0.01). Insulin treatment reduced the glomerular capillary thrombi in the CsA/low-dose-endotoxin diabetic animals. Thus, CsA aggravates the GSR with low-dose endotoxin but has no significant effect when high-dose endotoxin is given. Improved glycemic control reduces the GSR in CsA-treated rats. Thus, the interrelationships of diabetes, endotoxin, and CsA on the GSR are complex, and the pathogenesis of these events is unclear. 
3	The robustness of an empirically derived taxonomy of chronic pain patients. There is currently no classification system for chronic pain patients that has achieved consensus. The lack of a classification that is used consistently across settings has impaired advance of knowledge and treatment of chronic pain patients. Recently, an empirically derived multivariate classification system, the Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP) patients, has been developed. In this paper, the generalizability of the MAP system was evaluated by contrasting the MAP classification of 3 common but diverse chronic pain syndromes, namely, low back pain, headache, and temporomandibular disorders. The results indicate that although the proportion of patients classified into the 3 subgroups of the MAP taxonomy differ, the profiles based on the pattern of interrelationship among the assessment scales were remarkably similar. These data suggest that the psychosocial and behavioral responses associated with chronic pain are common to diverse samples of pain patients despite differences in demographic characteristics and medical diagnosis. The implications of these results for research and clinical practice are discussed. The potential utility of a polydiagnostic approach using more traditional medically based classifications such as proposed by the IASP (Merskey, H., Pain, Suppl. 3 (1986) S1-S225) complemented by classification based on the MAP psychosocial-behaviorally based taxonomy are examined. 
2	How bad are the symptoms and bowel dysfunction of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome? A prospective, controlled study with emphasis on stool form. Since it is not known whether the symptoms and bowel function of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome are truly abnormal we used diaries and frequent telephone interviews over a 31 day period to assess symptoms, defecation, and stool types in 26 unselected female hospital patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, 27 women who admitted to recurrent colonic pain but had not consulted a doctor (non-complainers), and 27 healthy control subjects. Unexpectedly, abdominal pain and bloating occurred in most of the control subjects. Pain, however, was six times more frequent in the patients and was more often considered severe. Bloating occurred three times more often. Defecation was more frequent, more erratic in timing and stool form, and more likely to produce stools of extreme forms, indicating rapid fluctuations in intestinal transit time. Urgency was four times more prevalent in patients than control subjects. Straining to finish defecating was nine times more prevalent and was often accompanied by feelings of incomplete evacuation--a combination which could lead to the misdiagnosis of constipation. The normal relation between stool form and the above symptoms was distorted, possibly due to rectal irritability. Non-complainers were intermediate between patients and control subjects in almost every parameter but were closer to control subjects than to patients. Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome have real cause for complaint and their bowel function is truly abnormal. 
5	Delayed chest wall pain due to sternal wire sutures. This report describes 18 patients with disabling chest wall pain due to one or more sternal wire sutures. The pain occurred from 2 to 84 months after a median sternotomy. The pain was described either as sharp and stabbing or as a deep-seated ache. The involved wires had an exaggerated fibrous tissue reaction surrounding the twisted portion. The adjacent noninvolved wires had minimal reaction. In the last 7 patients, serial sections of the fibrous tissue revealed entrapment of one or more sensory nerve fibers. In 6 of the 7 electrical potentials were measured and found to be elevated, indicating wire damage during twisting. Ferroxyl tests confirmed the collection of iron ions at this anodic point as a result of corrosion. Removal of the involved wires and the fibrous tissue surrounding this anodic point relieved the symptoms of pain and tenderness resulting from entrapped sensory nerves. 
1	Symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients: the role of fluid cytology. Clinical and cytologic findings in 21 breast cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion are presented. The etiology of the pericardial effusion was definitely malignant, by cytology/histology in 13 patients (62%), and suspected malignant by cytology in 2 patients (9%). One patient (5%) with definitely nonmalignant pericardial effusion by cytology was found to be histologically positive at autopsy. In 5 patients (24%) there was no histological/cytological evidence of malignancy; radiation pericarditis could be the etiology in 4 of these 5 patients. The median time from the diagnosis of breast cancer to the development of symptomatic pericardial effusion was 60 months (range: 1-219 months). Ten patients developed cardiac tamponade; they were treated by either pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy. The mean survival of patients with negative cytology/histology was 12 months; patients with suspicious cytology had a mean survival of 9 months; patients with malignant effusion, treated by pericardiectomy, had a mean survival of 22.3 months, while patients with malignant pericardial effusion, who were not subjected to surgery, had a mean survival of 4.7 months, only. It is concluded that the etiology of symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients is not always malignant, which emphasizes the role of fluid cytology in establishing definite diagnosis. The survival probability is a function of the extent of extracardiac disease; among patients with malignant pericardial effusion those selected for pericardiectomy have a longer than average survival. 
1	Developmental regulation of granulocytic cell binding to hemonectin. Hemonectin (HN), a component of the bone marrow (BM) extracellular matrix which promotes adhesion of cells in the granulocytic lineage, was purified to near homogeneity and tested for its ability to mediate attachment of normal and leukemic cells of granulocytic lineage. Purified HN immobilized on plastic substrates promoted serum-free attachment of normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells (CFC-GM), using an in situ attachment assay in which cell attachment is inhibited by specific polyclonal antisera. When unfractionated BM cells were allowed to attach to purified HN and stained in situ, HN preferentially bound cells at earlier stages of granulocytic differentiation. These observations were confirmed using cells of the HL-60 progranulocytic cell line which mirrored this differentiation-stage specific binding to HN. HN promoted attachment of 60% of uninduced HL-60 cells which were arrested at the progranulocyte stage, whereas only 15% of uninduced HL-60 cells attached to uncoated plastic and 4% to attached plastic coated with equal microgram quantities of bovine serum albumin (BSA). When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway by incubation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), attachment to hemonectin was reduced. Thus, both primary BM granulocytic cells and a granulocytic cell line show preferential attachment of those cells at earlier stages of differentiation. This developmentally regulated binding suggests a mechanism for release of maturing BM into the peripheral circulation. 
5	An operative complication in a patient with a true posterior communicating artery aneurysm: case report and review of the literature. Intraoperative oculomotor nerve injury in a patient with a true posterior communicating artery aneurysm is reported in detail. A comparison of internal carotid artery aneurysms at the posterior communicating artery junction with true posterior communicating artery aneurysms deserves special attention, because the vascular relationships of the aneurysm are more complex. A clip along the internal carotid artery does not occlude blood flow to the aneurysm, and the aneurysmal neck and the distal posterior communicating artery are closer to the oculomotor nerve. This is the 27th reported case of a true posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The incidence of true posterior communicating artery aneurysms ranges from 0.1 to 2.8% of all aneurysm patients. Such aneurysms constitute 4.6 and 11% of so-called posterior communicating aneurysms in two series. Difficulty associated with a preoperative diagnosis has been documented in at least 4 cases. An awareness of this rare aneurysm is stressed in order to avoid operative complications. 
2	Parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation for peptic duodenal stricture. Gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic duodenal stricture (pyloric stenosis) was treated with parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation of the stricture in 32 patients. Follow-up is in the range of 5 years in 37.4% of the patients, while 6 to 10 years follow-up is available in 62.4% of the patients. At their last follow-up, 74.9% of the patients were in either Visick 1 or 2 clinical status. Recurrence rates have been 3.1% at 1 year, 9.3% at 5 years, and 21.8% after 6 to 10 years follow-up. There has been only one instance (3.1%) of restenosis. Two patients required reoperation because of recurrence and one of them died. 
5	Pregnancy outcome after inadvertent ivermectin treatment during community-based distribution. Ivermectin is the drug of choice for community-based treatment of onchocerciasis. Since pregnancy testing during mass distribution campaigns is not feasible, the safety of ivermectin in pregnancy must be established. During a 3-year study, ivermectin was distributed to the population of a rubber plantation (14,000 people) in Liberia. Only 31% of women were aware of their pregnancy status during the first month; it was calculated that about half of women in the first trimester of pregnancy are likely to be treated inadvertently. 203 children born to women inadvertently treated during pregnancy were identified. In this limited sample, there was no significant difference in birth defects between treated and untreated mothers in the same population or compared with a reference population. Children of treated and untreated mothers showed no difference in developmental status or disease patterns. Further surveillance is necessary; however, since no major effects of ivermectin on pregnancy outcome were detected, there seems no need to change existing strategies of ivermectin distribution. 
4	Ultrastructural changes in impotent penile tissue: a comparison of 65 patients. To determine whether impotence is caused by specific and consistent changes in erectile tissue, we compared the ultrastructure of the corpora cavernosa in 6 controls with that in 59 patients undergoing implantation of a penile prosthesis. The impotent patients were divided into groups based on a medical history of hypertension (10), pelvic surgery (9), alcoholic smokers (8), hypertensive alcoholics (3), hypertensive alcoholic smokers (3), smokers (3), diabetics (8), diabetic smokers (3), Peyronie's disease (3), spinal cord injury (3) and isolated causes (6). Our data demonstrate that different behavioral and/or medical conditions produce similar degenerative tissue responses. There is no single or specific cause of impotence that is manifest by consistent changes in erectile tissue. 
3	The cholecystokinin receptor antagonist devazepide enhances morphine-induced analgesia but not morphine-induced respiratory depression in the squirrel monkey. The effects of the cholecystokinin antagonist devazepide on analgesia and respiratory depression induced by morphine in squirrel monkeys were examined. Pain thresholds were determined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 degrees C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 degrees C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. Devazepide (injected i.p. or p.o.) had no effect on tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The devazepide dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg injected i.p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower dose did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, devazepide had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that devazepide may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower dose of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression. 
2	Comprehensive management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess. Achieving reduced mortality rates in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess is possible by employing a comprehensive management plan. Components of the plan include (1) rapid evaluation and assessment of the degree of physiologic and anatomic derangement, the latter by the prompt use of vascular enhanced computed tomographic scan; (2) adequate fluid resuscitation determined by early institution of advanced hemodynamic monitoring; (3) attempts to identify and document septic foci via computed tomography-guided percutaneous aspiration; and (4) aggressive surgical debridement. Close adherence to these policies allowed us to keep mortality in this seriously ill group of patients to 14%. Most deaths occurred in patients who were referred to this service late in the course of their disease. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry (APACHE) II severity of illness index applied at the time of admission proved an accurate predictor of mortality. A score of 25 or greater was highly predictive of death, and a lesser score, of survival. 
5	Thoracoscopic treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax using carbon dioxide laser. In an effort to improve the success rate of the previously described thoracoscopic electrocautery ablation technique of spontaneous pneumothorax, the carbon dioxide laser was evaluated in 12 patients. The recurrent (5 patients) or persistent (7 patients) spontaneous pneumothoraces were caused by rupture of (1) blebs in 6 patients, (2) intrapulmonary apical type II bullae in 3 patients, and (3) diffuse bullous emphysema, type III, in 3. The air leaks were successfully sealed in all but 1 patient with ruptured type II bulla. Surgical specimen from this single failure suggested that the entire inner lining of the bullae must be thermocoagulated. This technical modification led to successful outcome in 2 subsequent cases. With the use of carbon dioxide laser, it was possible to treat not only small blebs but all types of bullae causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Laser thoracoscopy is effective and safe in treating spontaneous pneumothorax. 
5	Early solid feeding and recurrent childhood eczema: a 10-year longitudinal study. The relationship between early solid feeding practices and risks of recurrent or chronic eczema in childhood was examined in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 10. By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema. There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema. Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding. It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema. 
4	Dental extraction for patients on oral anticoagulant therapy. Dental extraction in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is a controversial issue. Continuation of anticoagulation exposes the patient to serious hemorrhage, whereas cessation of therapy increases the risk of thromboembolism. Forty patients treated by coumarin underwent 63 tooth extractions, without a change in the therapeutic protocol of anticoagulation. The biologic adhesive Beriplast was used successfully to achieve local hemostasis at the site of the surgical wound. Apart from one patient who had mild oozing, there were no incidences of postsurgical hemorrhage. 
5	Failure of surgery to improve outcome in hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage. A prospective randomized trial. Hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage remains a major cause of hemorrhagic stroke carrying extremely high morbidity. Considerable controversy remains regarding the optimal form of therapy. Between 1983 and 1989 we conducted a prospective randomized trial with three treatment strategies: best medical management, best medical management plus intracranial pressure monitoring, and surgical evacuation. Only patients with significant deficit harboring a putaminal hematoma at least 3.0 cm in diameter were entered. The study was interrupted after 21 patients had been studied (9, best medical management; 4, intracranial pressure monitoring; and 8, surgical evacuation). No differences were found among groups for age, admission blood pressure, and time interval between onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital. None of the subjects were capable of returning to prestroke activity. Fifteen (71%) died or remained vegetative at 6 months, and only 4 (19%) were capable of independent life at home. Of the 9 patients in the best medical management arm, 7 were dead or vegetative. In the surgical group, 4 patients died and only 2 were capable of independent life. These results suggest that current medical and neurosurgical therapies remain ineffective in preventing the devastating neurologic consequences of hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage. 
5	Pelvic pain and infections. Infectious etiologies of both acute and chronic pelvic pain are common and may involve multiple organ systems. In the evaluation of the acute pain, it is important to remember that rapidity of diagnosis is important because of the possibility of significant morbidity and even death if a condition is not attended to rapidly. In recent years, laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis has provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of some of these infections, as well as possible therapeutic maneuvers. The evaluation of chronic pelvic pain requires a thorough attempt at careful diagnosis with minds open to the possibility that other organ systems besides the genital tract may be involved. Laparoscopy also may be an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the evaluation of the sequelae of pelvic inflammation leading to chronic pelvic pain. All therapeutic modalities that are instituted on the basis of the diagnostic evaluation must take into consideration that a strong emotional component is generally associated with chronic pelvic pain. Such components must be addressed in order to achieve the best possible results for the patient. 
3	Is gastric acid responsible for the pain in patients with essential dyspepsia? The pathogenesis of symptoms in patients with essential dyspepsia is not known. Since treatment with H2-receptor antagonists has provided symptomatic relief in some reports, we carried out the present study to investigate whether gastric acid is responsible for symptoms in these patients. Fifty patients with essential dyspepsia and 25 healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, a nasogastric tube was passed and its tip positioned in the antrum under fluoroscopic control. Normal saline or 0.1 M hydrochloric acid was infused in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Eleven (22%) patients developed pain with acid infusion, but none with normal saline (p less than 0.005). In 10 of these 11 patients, pain recurred on rechallenge with acid infusion but was promptly relieved with infusion of 1 M sodium bicarbonate. None of the healthy controls developed pain on infusion of acid or saline. These observations suggest that acid has a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptoms in some patients with essential dyspepsia, although other factors may also be important. 
2	Yersinia enterocolitica O:3: an emerging cause of pediatric gastroenteritis in the United States. The Yersinia enterocolitica Collaborative Study Group. After an outbreak of Yersinia enterocolitica infections among black children in Atlanta, a seven-hospital study was conducted to determine the importance of this pathogen in other communities with large black populations. Of 4841 stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis examined between November 1989 and January 1990, Y. enterocolitica, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella were identified in 38, 49, 60, and 98 specimens, respectively; 34 (92%) of 37 Y. enterocolitica isolates were serotype O:3. Of the 38 patients with yersiniosis, 37 (97%) were children. Illnesses were clustered around the holidays, and 20 (62%) of 32 patients had been exposed to raw pork intestines in the 2 weeks before onset. Exposure was significantly associated with illness in a case-control study of eight patients identified at one hospital (P = .004). Infants less than or equal to 6 months old with yersiniosis were more likely to have immature-to-total neutrophil ratios greater than 0.50 than were infants of comparable age with salmonellosis (P = .02). Infrequently isolated in the past, Y. enterocolitica O:3 is emerging as an important enteric pathogen in this country, particularly among black children. 
5	A prospective study of the incidence and natural history of femoral vascular complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Over a 14-month period patients undergoing 144 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures were evaluated for the presence of complications at the femoral puncture site. After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty each patient was examined by a surgeon, and then a color-flow duplex scan of the groin was obtained. On the initial scan eight pseudoaneurysms, three arteriovenous fistulas, one combined arteriovenous fistula-pseudoaneurysm, and one thrombosed superficial femoral artery were detected for a major vascular complication rate of 9%. Pseudoaneurysm formation was associated with the use of heparin after removal of the arterial sheath. Seven pseudoaneurysms (initial extravascular cavity size range 1.3 to 3.5 cm) were followed with weekly duplex scans, and all thrombosed spontaneously within 4 weeks of detection. The three patients with isolated arteriovenous fistulas were each followed for at least 8 weeks, and the arteriovenous fistulas persisted. Early surgical intervention for postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms is usually unnecessary as thrombosis often occurs spontaneously. We would advocate an operative approach for pseudoaneurysms that are symptomatic, expanding, or associated with large hematomas. Iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas should be considered for elective repair, but this may be delayed for several weeks without adverse sequelae. 
5	Effect of hyperkalemia on experimental myocardial depression by verapamil. Three patients with systemic hypotension and sinus bradycardia that were initially refractory to conventional therapy responded well to intravenous calcium administration. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed immediate reversal of severe left ventricular dysfunction after intravenous administration of calcium in two instances. Common factors were hyperkalemia and verapamil therapy. This interaction was examined further by evaluation of contractility, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure in anesthetized dogs. Controls (n = 9) received saline infusion, and a second group (n = 10) received saturated potassium chloride (approximately 0.2 ml/min intravenously). In control dogs, administration of verapamil (1195 +/- 181 micrograms/kg intravenously) reduced systemic arterial pressure from 113 +/- 7 mm Hg to 74 +/- 5 mm Hg, and heart rate from 147 +/- 9 beats/min to 86 +/- 11 beats/min. Potassium chloride infusion alone increased blood [K+] from 3.4 +/- 0.1 to 6.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/L, but was without hemodynamic effects. In hyperkalemic dogs, a significantly lower dose of verapamil (428 +/- 42 micrograms/kg intravenously) reduced systemic arterial pressure from 102 +/- 8 mm Hg to 36 +/- 4 mm Hg, and heart rate from 150 +/- 5 beats/min to 104 +/- 15 beats/min. Myocardial contractile function was examined with right ventricular isometric contractile force and left ventricular segment length changes. In normokalemic and hyperkalemic groups, contractility was decreased by verapamil. Effects of verapamil on arterial pressure and contractility could be reversed significantly by administration of calcium, 0.4 mEq/kg intravenously. The present results support the theory that the negative hemodynamic effects of verapamil may be exaggerated to a harmful degree by concomitant hyperkalemia. These adverse events may be reversed by calcium administration. 
3	Infantile systemic hyalinosis: newly recognized disorder of collagen? Four infants with stiff skin and painful joint contractures in the first few months of life are described. Other features included small papules, particularly on the face and trunk, perianal nodules, hyperpigmentation over the metacarpophalangeal joints and over the malleoli, gingival hyperplasia, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Two of these infants died before the age of 18 months. In each case hyaline material was found in the papillary dermis. Ultrastructurally, there was a distinctive fibrillogranular appearance in which a banding pattern could be observed. This material was also found within membrane-bound vacuoles in macrophages and fibroblasts. It had an appearance and localization identical with that of collagen type VI. These features are similar to those reported in juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. It is believed that these infants have a closely related, but nonetheless distinctive, inherited disorder of collagen. 
5	Morphological changes and smooth muscle cell proliferation after experimental excimer laser treatment. BACKGROUND. Little is known about the mechanism(s) in the development of restenosis after excimer laser angioplasty. Thus, the rationale of this study was to determine the time course of intimal and medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and histomorphological changes after experimental excimer laser treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser ablation was performed in the right carotid artery of 34 New Zealand White rabbits after development of a fibromuscular plaque by repeated weak electrical stimulations. The vessels were excised 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after excimer laser treatment. Staining of alpha-actin was used to identify SMCs. In five rabbits (15%), a stenosis of more than 50% of luminal area was due to intimal proliferation of SMCs, and in four other rabbits, a total occlusion was due to organized thrombi. After the initial ablation of the performed plaque (13 +/- 6 intimal SMC layers) a continuous increase of intimal wall thickness was found from 7 +/- 6 SMC layers at 7 days to 28 +/- 5 intimal SMC layers at 28 days after excimer laser ablation (p less than 0.01). After 42 days, no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. After bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the extent of cell proliferation (percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis) in the intima and media was determined using a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistological quantification of SMC proliferation in the intima revealed a significant increase of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 3 (p less than 0.05) and 14 (p less than 0.01) days after laser treatment. Medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and had a significant increase 7 days (p less than 0.05) after intervention. Twenty-one days after laser treatment, SMC proliferation in the intima as well as in the media was normalized. CONCLUSIONS. The proliferative response of SMCs after experimental excimer laser treatment will occur as a dynamic process with a maximum of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis during 14 days after laser ablation, resulting in an increase of intimal thickening within 4 weeks after laser treatment. The extent of intimal hyperplasia due to SMC proliferation after excimer laser treatment is comparable with the effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty in this experimental model. 
2	Dietary predictors of symptom-associated gallstones in middle-aged women. In 1980, 88,837 women aged 34-59 y completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and were followed for 4 y. Four hundred thirty-three women reported a cholecystectomy for recent cholecystitis, and 179 reported unremoved, newly symptomatic gallstones diagnosed by ultrasound or x ray. Among the 59,306 women with Quetelet's index of relative weight less than 25 kg/m2, inverse associations were observed between intakes of vegetable fat and vegetable protein and the risk of reportedly symptomatic gallastones, after adjusting for age, Quetelet's index in 1980, weight change between 1976 and 1980, energy intake, and alcohol intake. The relative risk in the highest quintile of vegetable fat intake, as compared with the lowest quintile, was 0.6 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], and the corresponding relative risk for vegetable protein intake was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9). No significant associations were found with energy-adjusted intakes of cholesterol, animal fat, animal protein, carbohydrate, or sucrose. 
1	Advances in data assessment. Application to the etiology of nausea reported during chemotherapy, concerns about significance testing, and opportunities in clinical trials. Typical inferential statistical procedures, such as the t-test and analysis of variance, compare differences in mean values of variables. This approach can sometimes obscure rather than illuminate research data. Here we present and discuss alternative data analytic techniques. Potential advantages of box plots over conventional t-tests for understanding data are shown by comparing the area under high and low frequencies from spectral curves of autonomic changes following chemotherapy treatment. Typical t-tests provide information regarding statistical significance in terms of the differences in group means; box plots and related exploratory techniques provide information regarding the characteristics of the distributions within the groups as well as examination of potential outliers. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and other multivariate techniques are commonly used to deal with potentially complex data sets with multiple outcome measures. The potential advantages of visual clustering techniques such as star plots, Chernoff faces, and Andrew's Function Plots are demonstrated by examining changes in facial pallor caused by chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Typical MANOVA approaches can identify potential differences in mean values between groups; visual clustering approaches do this by graphically presenting complex interrelationships for individual cases. This approach enhances the visual interpretation of potential interactions that would be obscured by simply focusing on overall mean values. Preliminary data from a meta-analysis on the effect of metoclopramide on chemotherapy-induced vomiting demonstrates the potential uses and advantages of this summary technique over simple tabular summaries. We found significant relationships between the effect size of the drug and variables such as the year of study publication and whether the publication was an article or an abstract. While none of these techniques are meant to replace traditional inferential statistics, they offer advantages in terms of data exploration and understanding relationships within data sets that are not clearly addressed by other methods. They are potentially valuable alternatives worthy of exploration. Finally, we discuss issues of interim analyses and multiple endpoint assessment for clinical trials. 
5	Adverse haemodynamic effects of high-dose aprotinin in a paediatric cardiac surgical patient. High-dose aprotinin for reduction of intra- and postoperative blood loss was associated with profound hypotension and flushing in a 3.5-year-old child who underwent cardiac surgery. Treatment with noradrenaline and intravenous fluid was required. Cardiovascular stability was restored after 10 minutes. 
1	Induction of in vitro graft-versus-leukemia activity following bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia. We studied the in vitro effects of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from the peripheral blood of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients after allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). LAK cells were generated by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients post-BMT with recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) (500 U/mL) in 10% AB serum for 7 days. They were phenotyped and tested for activity in a standard 4-hour 51Cr release assay (n = 37) and in a CFU-GM assay (n = 24). We found that the LAK cells were mainly activated natural killer cells, but some were CD3+ T cells. In the 51Cr release assay LAK cells from 20 of 33 (61%) allogeneic and 2 of 4 syngeneic recipients killed recipient CML cells and in 22 of 37 (60%) cases also killed the HLA disparate CML cells. In the CFU-GM assay the LAK cells incubated together with the CML cells in liquid culture before plating inhibited (P less than .05) colony growth in 16 of 22 allogeneic and 2 of 2 syngeneic recipients. Cell-cell contact was necessary for optimal effect. There was little or no inhibition of proliferation of donor marrow CFU-GM. This in vitro graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect could also be demonstrated after LAK effectors were depleted of CD3+ T cells. It was inducible in recipients of both T cell-depleted and T cell-replete donor marrow and in recipients with or without graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted GVL effect is inducible following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT. The use of IL-2/LAK cells after BMT could reduce the risk of relapse. 
1	The effect of the gastrin receptor antagonist proglumide on survival in gastric carcinoma. Gastric cancer remains a disease with a very poor prognosis, and there is no safe and effective form of therapy for advanced disease. Evidence is now abundant to show that gastrin stimulates the growth of both gastric and colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and that blockade of gastrin receptors can prolong survival in xenografted nude mice. We have thus performed a randomized, controlled study of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor antagonist proglumide as therapy in 110 patients with gastric carcinoma. Proglumide had no overall effect on survival (Mantel-Cox statistic = 0.5, P = 0.48). The 95% confidence interval for the proglumide treated group was 260 to 474 days compared to 230 to 372 days for the control group. No significant difference was seen with proglumide, which has a relatively low affinity with the gastrin receptor and also has partial agonist activity. Drugs that are far more specific and potent gastrin receptor antagonists are becoming available, which may have a greater effect on survival, and further clinical trials of such compounds are clearly indicated to determine the efficacy of hormonal control of gastrointestinal malignancy. 
5	Primary intramedullary nailing of open femoral shaft fractures. The cases of 60 patients with 63 open femoral fractures treated by primary reamed intramedullary nailing were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two were classified as Type I open fractures, 26 as Type II and 15 as Type III open fractures by Gustilo's classification. All fractures were treated by wound debridement followed by immediate reamed intramedullary nailing. There were five early soft-tissue infections and three late deep infections. Of the late infections, only one was osteomyelitis (1.6%). There were three nonunions and seven malunions. All of the complications were dealt with effectively by standard methods. We concluded that primary reamed intramedullary nailing is an effective alternative for the treatment of Type I and II open femur fractures and for Type III open femur fractures associated with multiple trauma. 
5	Perioperative monitoring of blood flow in femoroinfragenicular vein grafts with Doppler ultrasonography: a preliminary report. A system for monitoring blood flow in femorodistal vein grafts with Doppler ultrasonography in the immediate postoperative period has been developed. Twenty-three grafts have been monitored for periods of up to 72 hours. Seventeen grafts have remained patent at minimum follow-up of 6 months, and six grafts occluded in the immediate postoperative period. Successful Doppler recordings were obtained in 16 successful and all failed grafts. Fast Fourier transform analysis of the Doppler signals was performed, and pulsatility index and time-averaged mean velocity were derived from the spectral information. Successful grafts displayed hyperemic flow with pulsatility index less than 2 and time-averaged mean velocity greater than 10 cm/sec. Failed grafts could be classified in two groups: those that occluded less than 24 hours after operation and those that occluded after 24 hours after operation. Short-term failure was categorized by highly pulsatile flow, with pulsatility index rising rapidly and time-averaged mean velocity falling correspondingly before actual cessation of flow. Delayed failure was less well defined but was suggested by failure to develop, or early deviation from, the hyperemic flow seen in successful grafts. Occlusion was heralded by development of the pulsatile pattern seen in the short-term failure group. 
1	Acute leukemia and related entities. Impact of new technology. Twenty-seven cases of acute leukemia and related entities were evaluated by morphologic examination, cytochemical study, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis, ultrastructural cytochemical study, and gene rearrangement analysis to determine the impact on the determination of the French-American-British (FAB) classification and the definitive diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis contained prognostic, diagnostic, and treatment information beyond the FAB classification that affected the disease course and patient management. All diagnostic variables were evaluated in each case and were labeled essential, ambivalent, supportive, or noncontributory. Except for gene rearrangement analysis, all variables we studied contributed essential data to establish the definitive diagnosis. Ambivalent findings were rare but could be explained with the knowledge of the total data. All variables, except cytochemical study, whose results were almost always essential, contributed supportive data. Noncontributory data only occurred with cytogenetic analysis in cases that demonstrated normal karyotypes. The FAB classification was established in 20 (74%) of the cases by use of morphologic examination, cytochemical study, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study. With use of the same variables, however, the definitive diagnosis, whose determination required all data, was established in only 15 (55.5%) of the cases. The addition of immunophenotyping increased the definitive diagnosis to 25 (92.5%) of the cases. The use of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase and platelet peroxidase analysis enabled us to definitively diagnose the remaining two cases (27 cases [100%]). Cytogenetic analysis revealed four cases in which essential information was added to the diagnosis. However, because the cytogenetic information usually was not immediately available, the result did not affect the immediate diagnosis or treatment. Surprisingly, the gene rearrangement studies did not yield essential data in any case and in a few cases contributed ambivalent data. This finding should not exclude gene rearrangement analysis in selected cases; however, the data should always be interpreted in light of all clinical and laboratory findings. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to the understanding of the acute leukemias and related entities and shows the impact of newer technologies on reaching a definitive diagnosis. 
1	Sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled probes for detection of human papillomavirus by in situ hybridisation. The sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled DNA probes for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) by dot blotting and in situ hybridisation was compared in tissues from cervical, laryngeal, and anogenital neoplasia. Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or labelled with biotin by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase. Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10-fold more sensitive by quantitative dot blotting and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes. The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than biotin labelled probes. It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation. Digoxigenin labelled probes also offer the possibility of double labelling in situ hybridisation procedures when used with biotin labelled probes to provide simultaneous identification of different DNA sequences. 
5	Micromotion of cemented and uncemented femoral components. We evaluated the initial stability of cemented and uncemented femoral components within the femoral canals of cadaver femurs during simulated single limb stance and stair climbing. Both types were very stable in simulated single limb stance (maximum micromotion of 42 microns for cemented and 30 microns for uncemented components). However, in simulated stair climbing, the cemented components were much more stable than the uncemented components (76 microns as against 280 microns). There was also greater variation in the stability of uncemented components in simulated stair climbing, with two of the seven components moving 200 microns or more. Future implant designs should aim to improve the initial stability of cementless femoral components under torsional loads; this should improve the chances of bony ingrowth. 
2	Squamous carcinoma in the liver. Squamous carcinoma of the liver has only rarely been reported. We present a case which highlights not only the difficulties in diagnosis but also how it can closely mimic sclerosing cholangitis. 
5	Gallbladder dynamics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and essential dyspepsia. To assess whether gallbladder motility is altered in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or essential dyspepsia (ED), we studied gallbladder function in 25 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with IBS, and 22 with ED. By real time ultrasonography, we studied the following parameters: (a) fasting gallbladder volume, (b) maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, (c) time required for maximal contraction, (d) residual volume after maximal contraction, and (e) percent fasting volume at 2 h. All parameters, except fasting gallbladder volume, were measured after a high-fat meal. The fasting gallbladder volume, maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, time required for maximal contraction, residual volume after maximal contraction, and percent fasting volume at 2 h in controls and patients with IBS was 19.3 +/- 8.8 ml and 24.4 +/- 9.7 ml, 67.1 +/- 10.7% and 67.6 +/- 13.5%, 41 +/- 20.6 min and 49.7 +/- 25.3 min, 6.2 +/- 3.3 ml and 7.6 +/- 5.3 ml, and 38.1 +/- 12.2% and 40.7 +/- 14.5%, respectively. The differences between the two groups were statistically not significant. The corresponding values in patients with ED were 15.5 +/- 6.3 ml, 57.6 +/- 16.5%, 51.8 +/- 29.3 min, 6.1 +/- 3.2 ml, 44.1 +/- 17%, respectively. Compared with controls there was no statistically significant difference in these parameters, except the maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, which was significantly less than that in controls (57.6 +/- 16.5% vs. 67.1 +/- 10.7%; p less than 0.05). Therefore, we could not find that patients with IBS have any abnormality of gallbladder function; postprandially, patients with ED have submaximal contraction of the gallbladder. 
1	Thoracoscopy for the diagnosis of pleural disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy and safety of thoracoscopy for the evaluation of pleural disease. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of patients referred for thoracoscopy. SETTING: University hospital specializing in chest diseases. PATIENTS: We studied 102 patients with pleural disease, the cause of which had not been determined after initial investigation, including thoracentesis and needle biopsy. Eighty-six patients had pleural effusion, 11 had pleural mass, and 5 had pleural effusion in association with a known primary lung carcinoma. INTERVENTION: All patients had thoracoscopy under local anesthesia with mild sedation. Visually directed biopsies were done of parietal pleura. MEASUREMENTS: We recorded clinical characteristics, laboratory data, findings and duration of thoracoscopy, and any complications associated with the procedure. Hospital and clinic follow-up records were reviewed, and patients were contacted by telephone 12 and 24 months after thoracoscopy to assess their health status. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred and four thoracoscopies were done in 102 patients. A definitive diagnosis was established in 95 patients: 42 had malignant pleural disease and 53 had benign pleural disease. A diagnosis of benign pleural disease using thoracoscopy could not be confirmed in the remaining 7 patients because of insufficient follow-up information. Overall, thoracoscopy was 96% accurate with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 93% for the diagnosis of pleural malignancy. Thoracoscopy was well tolerated under local anesthesia and entailed hospitalization for less than 24 hours in most cases. No deaths occurred, although 1.9% of patients had major complications, and 5.5% had minor complications. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pleural disease remaining undiagnosed after usual initial investigation, thoracoscopy done under local anesthesia is a rapid, safe, and well-tolerated procedure with an excellent diagnostic yield that is equivalent to that of thoracotomy. 
5	Soleus-specific myopathy induced by passive stretching under local tetanus. Twenty-four adult albino rats were injected with tetanus toxin into the right gastrocnemius muscle and then subjected to sustained dorsiflexion of the right ankle joint for 2 to 14 days. Histologic examinations of the soleus after this procedure showed myopathic changes, characterized by variations in fiber diameters, myonecrosis with opaque fibers, interstitial fibrosis, and small groups of regenerated fibers. Electron microscopy revealed derangement of T-tubules immediately adjacent to the sarcolemma in the early degenerative stage. The size and wet weight of soleus increased compared to that of the control side between 2 and 5 days post-tetanus. Serum GOT, LDH, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were elevated especially in the early degenerative stages. Peri- and endomysial fibrosis developed gradually from about 3 days post-tetanus. Pathomechanisms inducing these changes were discussed. 
4	Role of new antiplatelet agents as adjunctive therapies in thrombolysis. Coronary thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarcts who have no contraindications to such therapy. However, the time required for thrombolysis and the possibility of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. Herein are described experimental animal studies and clinical evaluations in which attempts have been made to develop adjunctive therapies that, when coupled with available thrombolytic interventions, might shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent reocclusion. From the studies conducted to date, it is clear that a combined thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist and heparin shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models with copper coil-induced coronary artery thrombi. A monoclonal antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor coupled with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and heparin also shortens the time to thrombolysis and delays or prevents reocclusion in experimental canine models. Thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and synthetic inhibitors, given with t-PA and aspirin, appear to shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models. Aspirin coupled with intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality in patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction, and a combination of heparin and t-PA results in infarct-artery patency more frequently than t-PA without heparin. Data from these studies are encouraging with regard to the possibility of developing effective and relatively safe thrombolytic regimens that shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion. 
4	Hypertension, endothelium, and cardiovascular risk factors. The functions of the endothelium and the effects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes on the endothelium are reviewed. The endothelium affects vascular tone by releasing vasodilators and modulating the effects of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, bradykinin, serotonin, and angiotensin II. Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle depends upon a functionally intact endothelium and the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide. Endothelial cells also appear to release a hyperpolarizing factor that relaxes smooth muscle through activation of the sodium-potassium pump, and of the endothelium-dependent contracting factors. Similarities are found in the vascular injury resulting from hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. When these risk factors coexist, they can act synergistically and magnify the vascular injury. The endothelium appears to be one of the major targets for these forms of injury. Future therapeutic strategies will focus on ways to prevent, arrest, or reverse endothelial injury. 
1	Expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor and its receptor in gynecologic malignancies. Recently, hematopoietic growth factors have been implicated in protean nonhematopoietic processes. In the current study, expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor (the c-fms proto-oncogene) was investigated in 42 samples of gynecologic tissues. There were 15 samples of normal ovarian and uterine tissue or benign conditions of these organs; 11 samples of primary ovarian cancer tissue; seven samples of metastatic ovarian cancer tissue; and nine samples of primary endometrial cancer tissue. Steady state transcript levels were assessed by Northern Blot analysis. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) expression was not observed in any of the specimens of benign abnormalities or of normal organs; c-fms expression was detected in two of 15 (13%) of these specimens, albeit at very low levels. In contrast, 14 (78%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens, and five (55%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed M-CSF. Similarly, 16 (89%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens and six (67%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed c-fms. Most positive malignant tissues (19 [86%] of 22) showed coexpression of M-CSF and c-fms. Of interest, M-CSF and c-fms mRNA were detected in tumor, but not in adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, M-CSF and c-fms transcripts were produced by all metastatic tumors, including two cases in which the corresponding primary tumor from the same patient was negative. Because M-CSF mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, the increased levels of both these gene products in gynecologic malignancies suggest that an interaction between M-CSF and c-fms may participate in the development of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and especially in progression to the metastatic state. 
1	Colon cancer in pregnancy with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level at presentation. A case of colon cancer in pregnancy is presented in which the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated. Failure to evaluate colon cancer as a cause of the elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may have accounted for the poor outcome. 
5	Linking in accessory pathways. Functional loss of antegrade preexcitation. BACKGROUND. Concealed retrograde activation has been proposed as a mechanism for antegrade conduction block in the bundle branches and atrioventricular accessory pathways. We studied this hypothesis (linking) in 10 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in whom antegrade preexcitation could be persistently blocked by overdrive atrial pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS. An atrial pacing protocol, with a decremental ramp followed by an incremental ramp, defined a range of atrial paced cycle lengths (linking window) associated with both persistent conduction and block in the accessory pathway. Within the limits of the linking window, the ability of an atrial impulse to conduct over the accessory pathway was dependent on the preceding state (i.e., conduction or block). The observed linking window ranged from 70 to 290 msec (mean, 185 +/- 68 msec) and closely approximated the measured delay in retrograde activation of the accessory pathway during persistent antegrade block. The mean antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathways was long (486 +/- 156 msec), and in each case, it exceeded the antegrade refractory period of the normal atrioventricular pathway. Critically timed premature ventricular extrastimuli, delivered while linking was maintained in the accessory pathway, were able to interrupt the linking and restore antegrade accessory pathway conduction. CONCLUSIONS. These observations suggest that accessory pathway linking is associated with bidirectional block in the accessory pathway. The ability to initiate linking (and the stability of the phenomenon) depends on a critical relation between antegrade accessory pathway refractoriness and the magnitude of retrograde accessory pathway activation delay. 
5	Sudden death due to delayed rupture of hepatic subcapsular hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma can cause sudden, unexpected death due to injuries to internal organs. Rupture of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma is a relatively rare cause of sudden death following minor blunt abdominal trauma. Death may be delayed several days to weeks. The autopsy is an invaluable diagnostic tool that can be utilized to uncover sudden deaths due to abdominal trauma. The case of an alcoholic who died of a ruptured hepatic subcapsular hematoma is presented. The death investigation revealed that the victim had sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a fall a few days prior to death. 
5	Role of visceral afferent mechanisms in functional bowel disorders. This report analyzes the clinical and physiological evidence supporting a role for altered visceral afferent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of two functional bowel syndromes: noncardiac chest pain and the irritable bowel syndrome. Considerable recent evidence indicates that increased contractility is present only in a minority of patients and that hypercontractile episodes are not temporally related to abdominal pain. In contrast, altered sensation and motor reflexes in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical distention or acid, is common when appropriately investigated. The vagal and spinal afferent innervation mediates visceral sensation and is involved in multiple reflex loops regulating gastrointestinal effector function, such as motility and secretion. Sensory input can be modulated peripherally at the afferent nerve terminal, at the level of prevertebral ganglia, the spinal cord, and the brainstem. An up-regulation of afferent mechanisms would result both in altered conscious perception of physiological stimuli and in altered motor reflexes. Current evidence is consistent with an alteration in the peripheral functioning of visceral afferents and/or in the central processing of afferent information in the etiology of altered somatovisceral sensation and motor function observed in patients with functional bowel disease. 
1	Small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma (undifferentiated lymphoma, Burkitt's type) in American adults: results with treatment designed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PURPOSE: Small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma (SNCL) "Burkitt's type," a rapidly growing lymphoma, has been rare among adults in the United States, but has greatly increased in incidence with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. This report details the results of treatment of adult SNCL with a series of protocols originally designed for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1973 and May 1987, 29 adults with newly diagnosed SNCL were treated at Memorial Hospital with intensive chemotherapy originally designed for ALL: the cyclophosphamide L-2, L-10, L-17, and L-20 protocols. Nine patients had positive serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One patient with all measurable disease resected was not evaluable for response. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 evaluable patients (57%) achieved a complete remission with treatment. With follow-up as long as 153 months (median, 47 months), 50% of all patients and 59% of patients with negative or unknown HIV serologies have survived and are probably cured. Patients with an initial serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level of greater than 500 U/L had a significantly shortened survival as compared with those with a lower serum LDH. Other pretreatment patient characteristics associated with a shortened survival of borderline statistical significance were high National Cancer Institute stage (C, D) and bone marrow involvement. These results are similar to those for ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma and are comparable to those for American SNCL in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one half of adults with SNCL are curable with intensive chemotherapy. More intensive chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor and/or autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell support may increase curability. 
5	A useful technique for measurement of back strength in osteoporotic and elderly patients. Improvement of back extensor strength (BES) can be used as a therapeutic method for patients with chronic back pain and osteoporosis. The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer (BID-2000) designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change, increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES, we tested 50 normal, healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position, maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient, and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe, reliable (coefficient of variation = 2.33%), and valid (P = 0.001) method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate, steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade. 
4	Systemic atropine administration during cardiac arrest does not cause fixed and dilated pupils. OBJECTIVES: Systemic administration of atropine during CPR may postpone brain death determination because of its reputed ability to produce fixed and dilated pupils. We studied the effect of atropine administered in the usual doses as an adjunct to endotracheal intubation and for cardiac arrest to determine if it would interfere with neurological assessment. DESIGN: Two groups of children were studied. Group 1 consisted of 28 patients who received atropine (0.03 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) prior to endotracheal intubation. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients previously without evidence of brainstem disease who suffered a witnessed arrest and had prompt return of spontaneous circulation and received an atropine dose of 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg/kg. RESULTS: In group 1, pupillary size averaged 4.02 +/- 0.78 mm before and 4.75 mm +/- .84 mm after atropine (P less than .001). In group 2, the pupillary examination was conducted 30 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation. The pupillary diameter was 4.80 +/- 0.91 mm. All pupils were reactive to light in both groups. CONCLUSION: Atropine administration in conventional dose causes slight pupillary dilation but does not abolish pupillary light reactivity. 
3	Surgical treatment of double major scoliosis. Improvement of the lumbar curve after fusion of the thoracic curve. We have evaluated two methods of surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic double major scoliosis in 59 patients. In group 1, 31 patients were treated by fusion of the upper curve only. In group 2, 28 patients had lumbar fusions also including most of the lower curve. The magnitude of the lower curve and the correction obtained in traction were good indicators of the correction achieved postoperatively. Forty-four patients were reviewed at a minimum of 10 years after operation. Those in group 1 showed sustained improvement of the lower curve with minimal stiffness and pain. Group 2 patients had lumbar curves of similar severity at review, but had significantly more low back pain and stiffness. The number of lumbar segments which remained mobile appeared to be a critical factor in determining the outcome. Selective fusion of the upper curve in double major scoliosis produces satisfactory results if the lumbar curve is less than 50 degrees. It may also be appropriate for flexible lumbar curves of larger angle. 
2	Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection. Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen. Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl. Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats. We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury. 
1	Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. A premalignant lesion? Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract, but its early diagnosis is uncommon. The use of ultrasonography has increased the detection of benign gallbladder tumors, and the premalignant potential of gallbladder adenomas is now undisputed. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder has recently been suggested to have malignant potential, and we report a case of adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in localized adenomyomatosis that was successfully treated by radical curative surgery. The more rigorous use of ultrasonography and a more aggressive approach to "benign" polypoid lesions of the gallbladder may represent the best way of achieving early diagnosis and cure in gallbladder cancer. 
3	Quantification of biomedical findings of chronic pain patients: development of an index of pathology. Difficulties in assessing and quantifying the biomedical signs and symptoms that may be related to patients' reports of pain are well recognized. Although there appears to be some consensus among physicians as to the potential utility of examination and diagnostic tests frequently used to evaluate chronic pain patients, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interpreting the results of these procedures. Moreover, the integration of biomedical findings to form a general index of pathology associated with chronic pain has been a difficult problem to solve because not all biomedical procedures used to evaluate pain patients are necessarily relevant or indicated for a specific patient. Two studies are presented that were designed to evaluate the reliability of 23 biomedical procedures commonly used to evaluate chronic pain patients and to determine if findings on these procedures can effectively be combined to form a reliable index of physical pathology. The results of study 1 suggest that 17 of the 23 procedures can be applied in clinical setting with acceptable levels of reliability. Study 2 provides evidence that an innovative weighted scoring approach, based on current medical consensus, can be used to produce a reliable, general index of pathology that is independent of the number of procedures used to evaluate patients. The utility of this quantification approach to biomedical findings for clinical and research purposes is discussed. 
3	Cumulative AIDS incidence and altered mortality from bacterial infections. To determine whether populations with high cumulative incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) experienced increased deaths from sepsis, central nervous system abscess, or endocarditis, New Jersey AIDS patients were grouped according to their age, sex, race, and residence-specific cumulative incidence of AIDS since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Between 1980 and 1986, among 25-44 year olds in the highest cumulative incidence group for AIDS, sepsis mortality increased from 3.3 to 15.2 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 11.9 deaths/100,000/year (95% confidence interval (6.9, 17.0) deaths/100,000/year); mortality from central nervous system abscesses increased from zero to 1.7 (0.1, 3.2) deaths/100,000/year; and mortality from endocarditis increased from 0.8 deaths/100,000/year to 2.4 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 1.6 (-0.5, 3.7) deaths/100,000/year. Age-matched New Jersey patient populations with low cumulative incidence of AIDS did not sustain a similar increase. The HIV disease-associated increase in sepsis mortality among young populations represents a new component of the substantial increase in U.S. sepsis mortality that occurred over the last two decades, but was previously limited to older populations. 
5	Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans. Both hypercapnia and tracheal irritation are known to constrict the airways in animals. To see whether similar responses occur in humans, we investigated tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responses to hypercapnia and tracheal irritation with water in 14 paralyzed and anesthetized humans. TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube. Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response. Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response. Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients. These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction. 
1	Stimulatory effects of maitotoxin on insulin release in insulinoma HIT cells: role of calcium uptake and phosphoinositide breakdown. In hamster insulinoma (HIT) cells, maitotoxin (MTX) induces a time-dependent and concentration-dependent release of insulin that requires the presence of extracellular calcium. The response is nearly completely blocked by cinnarizine and cadmium, but is not inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine or by manganese. MTX induces 45Ca+ uptake in these cells in a dose-dependent mode, and the uptake is blocked with cinnarizine, nifedipine and cadmium, and is partially inhibited by manganese. MTX induces phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells, and the response is partially blocked by cadmium, but is not affected by nifedipine, cinnarizine or manganese. High concentrations of potassium ions also induce insulin release and calcium uptake in HIT cells. Both effects of potassium are blocked partially by nifedipine, cadmium and cinnarizine. High concentrations of potassium do not induce phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells. The results suggest that MTX-elicited release of insulin is attained by two mechanisms: 1) a nifedipine-sensitive action, which results from MTX-induced activation of L-type calcium channels, which can be mimicked with high potassium concentrations; and 2) a nifedipine-insensitive action, which may be initiated by the activation of phosphoinositide breakdown by MTX. Such an activation of phospholipase C would result in the formation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, a release of intracellular calcium and then release of insulin to the extracellular space. Cinnarizine is proposed to block both MTX-elicited mechanisms, the first by blockade of calcium channels and the second by blocking 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate-induced release of internal calcium. Either mechanism alone appears capable of eliciting release of insulin. 
4	Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature. Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography. 
5	Optimal wound closure after tethered cord correction. Technical note. A technique of wound closure following tethered cord correction is presented that significantly reduces the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid collections in the subcutaneous space. In over 60 cases, the described method of fascia and skin closure has lessened wound problems to a minimal level. Patient hospitalization time has also been greatly diminished. 
4	Cardiac fluoroscopy for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease: a meta analytic review. To evaluate variability in the reported accuracy of fluoroscopically detected coronary calcific deposits for predicting angiographic coronary disease, we applied meta analysis to 13 consecutively published reports comparing the results of cardiac fluoroscopy with coronary angiography. Population characteristics and technical and methodologic factors were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity for predicting serious coronary disease compare quite well with those from the literature on the exercise ECG and the exercise thallium scintigram. Sensitivity increases and specificity decreases more significantly with patient age, and sensitivity is paradoxically lower in laboratories testing patients with more severe disease, as well as when 70% rather than 50% diameter narrowing is used to define angiographic disease. Work-up and test review bias were also significantly related to reported accuracy. 
4	Detection and evaluation of intrapulmonary vascular shunt with "contrast Doppler" transesophageal echocardiography. Contrast echocardiography is useful for detecting intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt lesions. In a patient with suspected pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, contrast transesophageal echocardiography was used to demonstrate the presence of a right-to-left shunt. By use of a combination of two-dimensional echocardiography, contrast injection, and pulsed Doppler echocardiography, each pulmonary vein was successfully interrogated for evidence of contrast shunting. This case demonstrates that contrast transesophageal echocardiography is useful for the detection of intrapulmonary fistulas and that it has the potential for localization of the shunt lesion. 
1	Laser recanalization versus endoscopic intubation in the palliation of malignant dysphagia. Forty patients with widely disseminated or locally advanced malignant obstruction of the middle or lower third of the oesophagus underwent endoscopic treatment by either NdYAG laser recanalization or intubation. Groups were matched on the basis of tumour location and swallowing was graded clinically before and after treatment. Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients. Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups. However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization. Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001). Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group. Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour. Intubation at a single session seems more appropriate than repeated laser therapy when tumour length exceeds 4 cm. 
2	Diagnosis of Campylobacter pylori gastritis. Campylobacter pylori is a bacterium that inhabits gastric mucosa. It causes chronic active gastritis and is highly associated with duodenal ulcer. Campylobacter pylori has a urease enzyme (not present in man), which allows diagnosis by a [14C]urea breath test. We compared two noninvasive tests, the breath test and serum ELISA, to biopsy and histologic diagnosis. Twenty-two patients who underwent gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible peptic ulcer disease entered the study. The breath test detected the organism in eight of eight patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%). The breath test was negative in 12 of the 14 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 86%). The ELISA was performed in 14 patients. It was positive in 5 of 5 patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%) and negative in 7 of 9 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 78%). We conclude that both the ELISA and the [14C]urea breath test are excellent noninvasive methods to detect Campylobacter pylori. However, only the breath test is suitable for following the response to treatment, as it detects the presence of the organism rather than an immune response to it. 
5	Aortic calcified plaques and cardiovascular disease (the Framingham Study). The relation between the presence of calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta, as detected on chest x-rays, and the development of cardiovascular disease is examined during 12 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort (n = 5,209). The prevalence of aortic calcified plaques approximately doubled with each decade of age, with only a trivial male predominance. Its presence was associated with a twofold increase in risk of cardiovascular death in men and women younger than age 65, even after other risk factors were taken into account. Similar increases in risk were found for coronary artery disease, stroke and intermittent claudication among middle-aged women. In middle-aged men these risks were less marked. The predictive value of aortic calcified plaques generally diminished with age. Risk of sudden coronary death in men with calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta ranged from a sevenfold increase at age 35 to no excess risk at age 70 years. These results support the view that atherosclerosis is a generalized process. The finding of aortic calcified plaques in a relatively young subject on a routine chest x-ray should be regarded as a sign for potential development of clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease in the cardiac, cerebral and peripheral arterial circulation. 
1	Methodologic issues in assessing the quality of life of cancer patients. Although quality of life assessments have been employed successfully in descriptive and evaluative studies in oncology, their use in cancer clinical trials has, to date, been limited. A range of issues have impeded the conduct of clinical trial-based quality of life investigations. These include: the absence of theoretical models to guide the development of quality of life measures; over-reliance on ad hoc approaches to quality of life assessment; and insufficient attention to the practical constraints operating in clinical research settings. Of primary importance is the need to develop multidimensional quality of life instruments that are brief and psychometrically robust. It is suggested that future work on instrument development focus on refining currently available generic or cancer-specific measures, and on developing new diagnostic-specific questionnaire modules. This psychometric work should be guided by appropriate theoretical models of the relationship among health-related quality of life domains. Although it is widely accepted that the patient represents the most appropriate source of quality of life data, it is suggested that efforts also be directed toward improving the validity and reliability of physician-generated assessments of patients' performance status and of treatment toxicities, and toward determining the feasibility of employing family members as proxy raters of the psychologic and social health status of patients who are unwilling or unable to provide such information. Additional attention should be paid to the many logistical problems that arise in clinical trial-based quality of life investigations. In particular, research designs and data collection procedures should be selected that minimize patient, medical staff, and institutional burden. 
4	The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. I. Summary of the current concepts of the mechanisms of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that is frequently resistant to medical therapy and has no satisfactory surgical therapy. The development of an effective surgical procedure to treat atrial fibrillation has been hampered by the paucity of clinically relevant information on the basic mechanisms responsible for the arrhythmia. This paper summarizes the current concepts of the electrophysiologic abnormalities in atrial flutter and fibrillation. 
5	Disordered colorectal motility in intractable constipation following hysterectomy. Colorectal and anal sphincter motility and electrophysiology were investigated in 14 women with profound constipation following hysterectomy and compared with an asymptomatic group of control subjects. Twelve patients complained of significant urinary symptoms. No differences in the motor function of the anal sphincters were detectable. The latency of the pudendoanal reflex was unchanged after hysterectomy. Proctometrograms demonstrated significantly increased rectal volumes and compliance in the hysterectomy group together with deficits of rectal sensory function. In the basal state a significant proximal-to-distal sigmoid colon motility gradient existed only in the control group. Following stimulation with Prostigmin, this gradient was enhanced in the control group but paradoxically reversed in the hysterectomized patients, thus constituting a functional obstruction. Denervation supersensitivity was demonstrable in two patients tested with carbachol provocation but not in control subjects. These findings suggest dysfunction in the autonomic innervation of the hindgut in some patients who had undergone hysterectomy, resulting in severe constipation. 
1	Epithelial tumors of the ovary: CT findings and correlation with US. One hundred thirty patients with 170 epithelial ovarian tumors were prospectively studied with computed tomography (CT) before surgery. Ultrasound (US) was performed in 108 patients with 138 tumors. At pathologic examination, 78 tumors (46%) were benign, 14 (8%) borderline, and 78 (46%) malignant. CT results were compared with surgical and pathologic findings in all patients. CT enabled detection of 148 of 170 tumors (87%), and US enabled detection of 118 of 138 tumors (86%). Benign serous cystadenomas (n = 42) were correctly characterized with a sensitivity of 69% at CT and 70% at US. Benign mucinous cystadenomas (n = 21) were correctly characterized with a sensitivity of 62% at CT and 50% at US. Malignancy was suggested in nine of 14 patients (64%) with borderline tumors at CT and in five of 14 (36%) at US. The overall accuracy of characterization of benign versus malignant tumors (including borderline tumors) was 94% with CT and 80% with US. In the 108 patients studied with both CT and US, the sensitivity of CT was significantly superior to that of US (P less than .03), whereas there was no significant difference in specificity (P = .125). 
2	Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis in a man. Idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis is a rare disease described in young adolescent women, characterized by fibrosis and adhesions of the peritoneum to loops of the small bowel. Here we describe a 35-year-old man who underwent exploratory laparotomy for repeated small bowel obstruction. Only partial resection of the terminal ileum was possible because of adhesions; recurrent abdominal infections and leakage from anastomosis required further resection, which ultimately resulted in short bowel syndrome and malabsorption. The clinical and pathological findings were characteristic for idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis. We review the relevant literature, to confirm, to the best of our knowledge, that this is the first report of a male patient who has developed this rare disease. 
4	Torsades de pointes therapy with phenytoin. We present the case of a woman with myocardial infarction complicated by malignant ventricular arrhythmia and torsades de pointes. The torsades de pointes was refractory to conventional therapy but responsive to phenytoin. This case suggests the clinical usefulness of phenytoin for adjunct therapy of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when standard treatment modalities fail. 
2	When is polypectomy sufficient treatment for colorectal cancer in a polyp? Eighty-seven patients with a carcinoma in a polyp were reviewed over a 12-year period. Ten histologic criteria were analyzed for an association with the presence of residual carcinoma. Four factors were identified as having prognostic value: size greater than 1.5 cm, sessility, cancer of at least 50% of the adenoma volume, and invasive carcinoma. Polypectomy alone is adequate treatment unless the carcinoma invades deeper to the muscularis mucosa and is associated with one or more of these characteristics. 
5	Extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation after scleral buckling surgery. We reviewed the records of 28 patients who had undergone successful scleral buckling surgery followed by extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens. Posterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in 27 eyes, and anterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in two eyes with posterior capsule rupture at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 44 months. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15 of 29 eyes (52%). One eye (3.4%) developed a recurrent retinal detachment 15 months after cataract surgery. Two eyes (6.9%) developed angiographically proven cystoid macular edema. The outcome for extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in eyes that had previously undergone successful scleral buckling for retinal detachment is favorable. 
1	p53 mutations in colorectal cancer. Immunohistological staining of primary colorectal carcinomas with antibodies specific to p53 demonstrated gross overexpression of the protein in approximately 50% of the malignant tumors examined. Benign adenomas were all negative for p53 overexpression. To determine the molecular basis for this overexpression we examined p53 protein expression in 10 colorectal cancer cell lines. Six of the cell lines expressed high levels of p53 in ELISA, cell-staining, and immunoprecipitation studies. Direct sequencing and chemical-mismatch-cleavage analysis of p53 cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction in these cell lines showed that all cell lines that expressed high levels of p53 were synthesizing mRNAs that encoded mutant p53 proteins. In two of those four cell lines where p53 expression was lower, point mutations were still detected. Thus, we conclude that overexpression of p53 is synonymous with mutation, but some mutations would not be detected by a simple immunohistochemical analysis. Mutation of the p53 gene is one of the commonest genetic changes in the development of human colorectal cancer. 
2	The current spectrum of peptic ulcer disease in the older age groups. Not only has there been a relative increase in the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) among America's older age groups, but the characteristics of PUD in these patients differ significantly from those of the general population. Seventy-two consecutive patients 60 years of age or older who underwent operation for PUD between 1984 and 1989 were studied. The unusual features in these patients were 1) 92 per cent required emergency operation, 2) 57 per cent with perforated PUD were female, 3) 85 per cent had duodenal pathology, 4) 28 per cent were currently taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and 5) over one half of all patients had serious postoperative complications. The increasing incidence and associated serious complications of PUD in the elderly population present new challenges to physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. 
5	Overt hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by zinc deficiency. Encephalopathy in liver disease may be unresponsive to protein restriction, lactulose, and neomycin. Zinc supplements have been reported to improve psychometric performance in liver cirrhosis, but the importance of zinc deficiency in overt hepatic encephalopathy has not yet been clearly established. A patient with severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy was studied to determine the relation between her signs of encephalopathy and zinc deficiency. The study included a period in which zinc deficiency was artificially induced by oral histidine. An episode of overt encephalopathy occurred that was identical to earlier episodes and responded to oral zinc. The study showed an association between encephalopathy and zinc deficiency by successive zinc depletion and supplementation regimens. Long-term zinc supplementation improved severe recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the quality of life. 
5	Diaphragmatic fatigue produced by constant or modulated electric currents. In anesthetized rabbits the efficiency of phrenic nerve stimulation with trains of electric current was studied either when ventilation was effected entirely by bilateral nerve stimulation (electrophrenic ventilation) or during unilateral nerve stimulation when animals were ventilated with a pump and open chest. Trains of rectangular electric pulses (RPT) with constant amplitude and frequency or sine waves, both the amplitude and frequency of which were modulated and controlled by a computer (MSWT), were used with each animal. MSWT closely reproduced the physiological shape of transdiaphragmatic pressure waves. Diaphragm fatigue, as determined from the decrease in the maximal relaxation rate of twitches, occurred after 20 minutes of bilateral or unilateral nerve stimulation with RPT, but only after 60 min (unilateral stimulation) or 98 min (bilateral stimulation) with MSWT. These data show the importance of the motor signal pattern in long-lasting nerve stimulation. 
3	Diagnostic quality and complications of hysterosalpingography: oil- versus water-soluble contrast media--a randomized prospective study. In a prospective randomized study of 417 patients, side effects and complications of contrast media and the diagnostic quality of images obtained after hysterosalpingography (HSG) were evaluated after use of diatrizoate meglumine (104 patients), ioxaglate (105 patients), iohexol (105 patients), or ethiodized poppy-seed oil (103 patients). The authors detected no differences among these groups in the prevalence of pain during HSG. The prevalence of lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after HSG was significantly lower in the group that received ethiodized poppy-seed oil than in the three other groups. The prevalence of pelvic infection or inflammation was significantly lower with ethiodized poppy-seed oil than with water-soluble media. All contrast media provided acceptable diagnostic image quality with regard to fallopian tubes, peritoneal spill, and intraperitoneal distribution. Visualization of the uterine cavity and ampullary rugae was significantly better with water-soluble media than with ethiodized poppy-seed oil, which was associated with a high conception rate and which the authors consider preferable for HSG. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates that electric stimulation of cerebellar fastigial nucleus reduces cerebral infarction in rats. We sought to determine whether high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging is useful for noninvasive quantitation of the ischemic infarct produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and for detection of reduced infarct volume elicited by electric stimulation of the cerebellar fastigial nucleus. Male rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain were anesthetized, the middle cerebral artery was occluded, and the fastigial nucleus was stimulated for 1 hour. Twenty-four hours later, rats were reanesthetized and T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. Rats were killed and the volume and distribution of the lesion was established by histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging estimates of the lesion volume were 271 +/- 41.0 mm3 (middle cerebral artery, n = 5) and 148 +/- 8.4 mm3 (middle cerebral artery + fastigial nucleus stimulation, n = 6; 45% reduction, p less than 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed a lesion of 229.8 +/- 15.4 mm3 involving somatosensory cortex, lateral caudate putamen, and lateral hippocampus. Fastigial nucleus stimulation resulted in a 36% reduction in infarct volume to 146.0 +/- 10.3 mm3. The retrieved zone was largely in the cortex dorsal and ventral to the lesion and mostly posterior to the lesion. The estimates of lesion volume by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology did not differ and were highly correlated (r = 0.90; p less than 0.001). This study confirms our previous finding that fastigial nucleus stimulation reduces the volume of a focal ischemic infarct and demonstrates that magnetic resonance imaging not only accurately estimates the volume of the lesion but also can detect changes as small as 50-100 mm3. 
1	Internists' practices in health promotion and disease prevention. A survey. OBJECTIVE: To estimate internists' use of disease prevention and health promotion activities, and to explore demographic, professional, behavioral, psychological, cognitive, and organizational factors associated with the use of such practices. DESIGN: Mail survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A sample of 2610 members and fellows of the American College of Physicians (ACP) participated in the study. They engaged in patient care activities more than 20 hours per week and were stratified by gender and region. They lived in four geographic areas of the United States (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West), comprising 21 ACP regions. MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire requesting background information as well as information about personal health; record keeping; use of immunizations (pneumococcal, influenza, tetanus, hepatitis B); use of screening tests and procedures for detecting cancer (breast examination, Papanicolaou smear, stool occult blood test) and other diseases (electrocardiograms, cholesterol level tests, chest radiographs); and behavioral counseling to promote health (in the areas of smoking, exercise, and alcohol and seat belt use). MAIN RESULTS: Internists used effective preventive interventions less frequently and ineffective practices more frequently than experts recommend. Internists' use of health promotion and disease prevention activities is associated with habit, attitude, and a lack of adequate knowledge. Younger physician age, general internal medicine practice, and personal health promotion and disease prevention practices were strongly associated with more appropriate use of recommended practices (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internists' use of disease prevention and health promotion activities falls short of expert recommendations. Programs to improve the delivery of preventive services might be aimed at improving physicians' personal health practices, might be directed toward patients, and might include the development of effective systems to remind physicians. 
1	Refractory parastomal ulcers: a multidisciplinary approach. Chronic parastomal ulcers in patients with ileostomy or colostomy stomas are unusual. Previous reports have implicated infections, fistulas, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pyoderma gangrenosum, and trauma. Over the past 8 years we have evaluated 10 cases of such refractory parastomal ulcers that occurred at a mean of 11 years after stomal surgery. Eight patients had had an ileostomy for IBD while two had undergone colostomy for colon cancer. Five patients with IBD were diagnosed as having pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerations. They required systemic treatment for a mean of 25 weeks to effect ulcer healing. The other five patients had either parastomal ulcers on the basis of dermatoses (contact dermatitis, eczema, or bullous pemphigoid) or contact ulcers due to face-plate pressure and parastomal dermatitis. These patients received topical treatment with healing of ulcers in a mean of 4 weeks. We conclude that parastomal ulcers occurring in patients without IBD or IBD patients without classic pyoderma gangrenosum require early dermatologic evaluation as they respond relatively quickly to appropriate local therapy. 
1	In vivo selection and characterization of a murine mammary tumor subline with high potential for spontaneous lymph node metastasis. A transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma, grown in Balb/c mice, with a marked enhancement in its draining lymph node metastatic ability (MM3LN), was obtained through an in vivo procedure from a variant tumor moderately metastatic to lymph nodes (MM3). Both MM3 and MM3LN presented a similar latency and tumor growth rate and reached the same tumor mean diameter at death. MM3LN tumor-bearing mice exhibited a larger mean survival time. The new variant showed a 2.5-fold higher incidence of tumor-draining lymph node metastases than MM3 line, with no differences in the incidence of lung metastases. Morphology as well as cytogenetic and in vitro adhesion properties were studied in order to characterize the new subline. This murine tumor model has potential application in the study of the metastatic process in lymphoid tissue. 
4	Correlation between amino acid release and neuropathologic outcome in rat brain following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Using in vivo brain microdialysis, we studied amino acid release in the striatum and cortex of eight rats following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. We then processed all brains for histopathologic assessment of the volume of ischemic damage 4 hours after occlusion. Ischemic damage was varied by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at a point either proximal (n = 4) or distal (n = 4) to the lenticulostriate vessels. Proximal occlusion elevated the dialysate contents of all amino acids. The largest increases occurred for the potentially neurotoxic amino acids aspartate and glutamate and for taurine (800-2,800% of basal efflux). We observed smaller increases for the "metabolic" amino acids (280-580% of basal efflux). Distal occlusion did not affect amino acid efflux in the striatum, and release in the cortex was significantly lower than that following proximal occlusion. We compared release data with acute histopathologic outcome. Proximal occlusion resulted in a large volume of ischemic damage in the cortex and striatum (25-48% of hemispheric volume). A smaller volume of ischemic damage was noted following distal occlusion (0-21% of hemispheric volume). The volume of ischemic damage and the amount of amino acid release were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05). 
2	Colonoscopic screening of asymptomatic patients with a family history of colon cancer. The records of 201 asymptomatic patients who underwent colonoscopy based solely on a family history of colon cancer were reviewed. Eighty-five patients (42 percent) had a total of 166 lesions. Fifty-four (27 percent) patients of the screened population had neoplastic lesions, while 31 (15 percent) patients had nonneoplastic polyps. Four carcinomas were found. Twenty-five of the patients with polyps (29 percent) had no polyps distal to the splenic flexure; these proximal polyps (and two carcinomas) would have been missed on screening with fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy. Nineteen of these 25 patients had polyps smaller than 0.5 cm, which likely would have been missed with contrast enemas. Almost one half (47 percent) of all polyps discovered at screening colonoscopy were proximal to the descending colon. Only one patient younger than 40 years old had adenomas. The yield of polyps and cancer in patients with familial risk indicates screening colonoscopy should be considered after age 40. 
1	Intralesional interferon therapy for basal cell carcinoma. In a clinical trial of 172 patients at four medical centers, interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) or a placebo was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of interferon-treated patients and in only 29% of placebo-treated patients. During the treatment course and follow-up, an initial inflammatory response was observed at the treatment sites, followed by diminished erythema, improvement in overall appearance, and a decrease in size of lesions. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group. Only three patients, all in the interferon-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. One year after initiation of therapy, 81% of interferon recipients and 20% of those given the placebo remained tumor free. Noduloulcerative and superficial lesions were equally responsive to treatment with interferon. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment. 
2	Sexual behavior before AIDS: the hepatitis B studies of homosexual and bisexual men. Data on sexual practices, collected during studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 1978 and 1979, were analyzed for 4910 homosexual and bisexual men from Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and St Louis. Data on sexual practices in 1978 showed that white participants had larger numbers of non-steady male sexual partners and engaged in oral-genital activities more frequently but were equally likely to engage in anal intercourse as black and Hispanic participants. San Francisco participants had more non-steady sex partners and were more likely to engage in receptive anal intercourse with non-steady partners than participants from all other sites. Analysis of data on 606 HBV-antibody-negative men interviewed on three occasions in 1978 and 1979 showed no changes in risk indices for insertive and receptive anal intercourse between these years, except in San Francisco where significant declines occurred in insertive anal intercourse and receptive anal intercourse without ejacultion in a small, highly select group of participants. 
2	Oral cholecystography in contemporary gallstone imaging: a review. The introduction of nonoperative alternatives to elective cholecystectomy in the management of gallstones has resurrected use of oral cholecystography (OCG). This article reviews basic principles involved in the proper performance of OCG and interpretation of the resulting images. The role of OCG in the current management of gallstones is discussed. 
3	Cerebrovascular and metabolic effects on the rat brain of focal Nd:YAG laser irradiation. To investigate the effects of focal neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser irradiation (lambda = 1060 nm) on regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral protein synthesis, and blood-brain barrier permeability, the parietal brain surface of 44 rats was irradiated with a focused laser beam at a constant output energy of 30 J. Survival times ranged from 5 minutes to 48 hours. Laser irradiation immediately caused well-defined cortical coagulation necrosis. Within 5 minutes after unilateral irradiation, 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographs demonstrated severely reduced blood flow to the irradiation site and perilesional neocortex, but a distinct reactive hyperemia in all other areas of the forebrain. Apart from a persistent ischemic focus in the vicinity of the cortical coagulation necrosis, blood flow alterations in remote areas of the brain subsided within 3 hours after irradiation. Autoradiographic assessment of 3H-tyrosine incorporation into brain proteins revealed rapid onset and prolonged duration of protein synthesis inhibition in perifocal morphologically intact cortical and subcortical structures. Impairment of amino acid incorporation proved to be completely reversible within 48 hours. Immunoautoradiographic visualization of extravasated plasma proteins using 3H-labeled rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins-showed that, up to 1 hour after irradiation, immunoreactive proteins were confined to the neocortex at the irradiation site. At 4 hours, vasogenic edema was present in the vicinity of the irradiation site and the subcortical white matter, and, at later stages (16 to 36 hours), also extended into the contralateral hemisphere. Although this was followed by a gradual decrease in labeling intensity, resolution of edema was still not complete after 48 hours. Analysis of sequential functional changes in conjunction with morphological alterations indicates that the evolution of morphological damage after laser irradiation does not correlate with the time course and spatial distribution of protein synthesis inhibition or vasogenic edema. Although the central coagulation necrosis represents a direct effect of radiation, the final size of the laser-induced lesion is determined by a delayed colliquation necrosis due to persistent perifocal ischemia. Extent and severity of ischemia in a zone with initial preservation of neuroglial cells can be explained by the optical properties of the Nd:YAG laser; extensive scattering of light within brain parenchyma associated with a high blood-to-brain absorption ratio selectively affects blood vessels outside the irradiation focus. 
5	Allelic loss of chromosomes 16q and 10q in human prostate cancer. Recent advances in understanding the molecular genetics of common adult tumors have indicated that multiple genetic alterations including the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are important in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Loss of heterozygosity is a hallmark of tumor suppressor gene inactivation and has been used to identify chromosomal regions that contain these genes. We have examined allelic loss in the most common tumor in men, prostate cancer. Twenty-eight prostate cancer specimens have been examined for loss of heterozygosity at 11 different chromosomal arms including 3p, 7q, 9q, 10p, 10q, 11p, 13q, 16p, 16q, 17p, and 18q. Fifty-four percent (13/24) of clinically localized tumors and 4 of 4 metastatic tumors showed loss of heterozygosity on at least one chromosome. Chromosomes 16q and 10q exhibited the highest frequency of loss of heterozygosity with 30% of tumors showing loss at these chromosomes. These data demonstrate that allelic loss is a common event in prostate cancer and suggest that chromosomes 16q and 10q may contain the sites of tumor suppressor genes important in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer. 
2	In vivo evaluation of monopolar versus bipolar electrosurgical polypectomy snares. The energy required and tissue damage in bipolar and monopolar polypectomy snares were compared in a canine model. The bipolar snare required an average of 34 joules of energy, whereas the monopolar snare required 228 joules to cut the same diameter of gastric mucosa tended into a polypoid structure (p = 0.0005). The reduced energy delivered to the tissue from the bipolar procedure resulted in only 32% average depth of damage to the underlying gastric wall, whereas the monopolar procedure caused an average 69% (p = 0.001). Surgically created polyps required 247 joules and 69 joules for corresponding monopolar and bipolar polypectomy (p = 0.001). The decreased energy required and the correspondingly reduced damage caused to the underlying bowel wall by the bipolar snare should reduce the incidence of perforation and post-polypectomy syndrome. The bipolar snare completes a local circuit about the snare, eliminating the return electrode and, consequently, the possibility of any return electrode burns. The bipolar snare thus provides an added safety margin during polypectomy. 
1	1990 Ogura memorial lecture: moral dilemmas in head and neck cancer. Neither morality nor dilemma can be defined meaningfully in the concept of the practical management of head and neck cancer. Although both have important implications, particularly with regard to ethnic and social factors, they play a relatively minor role in determining management policy. With little knowledge of the intrinsic causes of cancer and with a treatment strategy limited to radiotherapy and surgery, our desire for cure must be tempered by concern to avoid any increase in patient privations. My philosophy, based upon the care of more than 3500 patients over almost 30 years, reflects some of the difficulties of applying the concept "do nothing that may cause harm," while offering each patient the opportunity for long-term cure. 
4	Left ventricular filling impairment in asymptomatic chronic alcoholics. Systolic left ventricular dysfunction is relatively common in even asymptomatic alcoholics, but whether diastolic function is also altered is much less well-studied. We used M-mode and Doppler echocardiography to study left ventricular size, mass, systolic function and diastolic filling in 32 alcoholics free of clinically detectable heart disease and in 15 healthy control subjects. Left ventricular mass index and posterior wall thickness were higher in alcoholics than in controls, but there was no statistically significant difference either in end-diastolic size or in systolic ventricular function. More abnormalities were found in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function, however. The alcoholics had a prolonged relaxation time (200 +/- 6 vs 184 +/- 5 ms [mean +/- standard error], p less than 0.05), a decreased peak early diastolic velocity (52 +/- 2 vs 60 +/- 3 cm/s, p less than 0.05), a slower acceleration of the early flow (410 +/- 18 vs 552 +/- 43 cm/s2, p less than 0.01), and a higher atrial-to-early peak velocity ratio (0.74 +/- 0.04 vs 0.60 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05). This pattern of changes suggests a primary abnormality in the relaxation of the left ventricle. In multivariate analyses, the abnormalities in the Doppler indexes were independent of the duration of alcoholism, the quantity of the most recent ethanol exposure and the increased mass of the left ventricle. Impaired early filling of the left ventricle due to delayed relaxation is common in asymptomatic alcoholics and may in fact be the earliest functional sign of preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy. 
4	Effect of verapamil on mortality and major events after acute myocardial infarction (the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II--DAVIT II) The effect of verapamil on death and major events (i.e., death or reinfarction) after an acute myocardial infarction was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Eight hundred seventy-eight patients started treatment with verapamil, 360 mg/day, and 897 patients with placebo. Treatment started in the second week after admission and continued for up to 18 months (mean 16 months). Ninety-five deaths and 146 major events occurred in the verapamil group and 119 deaths and 180 major events in the placebo group. The 18-month mortality rates were 11.1 and 13.8% (p = 0.11, hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence limits, 0.61 to 1.05), and major event rates 18.0 and 21.6% (p = 0.03, hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence limits, 0.64 to 0.99) in the verapamil and placebo groups, respectively. In patients without heart failure in the coronary care unit the mortality rates were 7.7% in the verapamil group and 11.8% in the placebo group (p = 0.02, hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence limits, 0.44 to 0.94), and major event rates 14.6 and 19.7% (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 0.70; 95% confidence limits (0.52 to 0.93). In patients with heart failure the mortality rates were 17.9 and 17.5% (p = 0.79, hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence limits, 0.72 to 1.54), and major event rates 24.9 and 24.9% (p = 1.0, hazard ratio 0.98; 95% confidence limits 0.72 to 1.39). Long-term treatment with verapamil after an acute myocardial infarction caused a significant reduction in major events, and the positive effect was found in patients without heart failure. 
2	Human breast milk contains bovine IgG. Relationship to infant colic? Previous studies have suggested that an unidentified cow's milk protein, other than beta-lactoglobulin and casein, might play a pathogenetic role in infant colic. Therefore, a radioimmunoassay was used to analyze human breast milk and infant formula samples for the presence of bovine IgG. Milk samples from 88 of the 97 mothers tested contained greater than 0.1 micrograms/mL of bovine IgG. In a study group of 59 mothers with infants in the colic-prone 2- to 17-week age group, the 29 mothers of colicky infants had higher levels of bovine IgG in their breast milk (median 0.42 micrograms/mL) than the 30 mothers of noncolicky infants (median 0.32 micrograms/mL) (P less than .02). The highest concentrations of bovine IgG observed in human milk were 8.5 and 8.2 micrograms/mL. Most cow's milk-based infant formulas contained 0.6 to 6.4 micrograms/mL of bovine IgG, a concentration comparable with levels found in many human milk samples. The results suggest that appreciable quantities of bovine IgG are commonly present in human milk, that significantly higher levels are present in milk from mothers of colicky infants, and that bovine IgG may possibly be involved in the pathogenesis of infant colic. 
1	Hemangiopericytoma of the sciatic nerve. Case report. The authors report the case of a hemangiopericytoma arising in a sciatic nerve. It was found to be invasive within the epineurium but sparing surrounding tissues. Adequate resection required sacrifice of the nerve. Hemangiopericytomas can be added to the short list of mesodermal peripheral-nerve tumors. 
1	Monocytoid B-cell lymphoma arising in extranodal organs. Six cases of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL) developing in extranodal sites (thyroid, three; stomach, two; rectum, one) are described. Patients were all women aged 46 to 65 years (median, 53 years). Three patients with thyroid lymphoma presented with an increasing goiter, two with positive serum antithyroid antibodies, and one patient had chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLTH). The histologic type of surgically resected specimens was a diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells with monocytoid appearance, i.e., abundant pale cytoplasm with distinct cell border and small reniform nucleus. These cells were CD20+, 22+, 24-, 9- showing their B-cell origin. The monoclonal nature of the proliferating cells was confirmed by restricted expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain and/or gene rearrangement study in three cases. Two cases of thyroid lymphoma in which the monoclonality could not be confirmed had histologic appearances characteristic of malignant lymphoma. All three patients with gastric or rectal lymphoma had reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) near the tumors. These findings showed presence of MBCL in the extranodal sites with invariable coexistence with lymphoid follicles formed by CLTH in thyroid or RLH in stomach and rectum. 
5	Gastroduodenal mucosa in uraemia: endoscopic and histological correlation and prevalence of helicobacter-like organisms. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of endoscopic and histological gastroduodenitis as well as helicobacter-like organisms in patients with end stage renal failure undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. A total of 322 out of 422 patients in our dialysis programme underwent endoscopy and gastroduodenal biopsy specimens were taken from 260. Endoscopic gastroduodenitis occurred in 158 (49%). Histological gastritis occurred in the gastric body or antrum in 134 patients (52%) and duodenitis in 52 (21%). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histological gastritis in contrast to a significant correlation for duodenitis. Helicobacter-like organisms occurred in the body or antrum in 81 (31%). Their presence was associated with gastritis--in particular acute and acute on chronic gastritis rather than chronic gastritis. Patients with gastritis were significantly older than those without (p less than 0.001) and had lower basal and peak acid outputs. 
1	Management of spinal cord compression secondary to metastatic prostatic carcinoma. Spinal cord or cauda equina compression from prostatic cancer is an oncologic emergency necessitating prompt evaluation and treatment. The strong correlation between pretreatment motor status and treatment outcome underscores the importance of immediate treatment before further neurologic deterioration and before the damage to the spinal cord becomes permanent. Patients with known osseous metastases should be alerted by their clinicians to seek medical help within hours should they develop weakness in an extremity. Prompt MRI of the entire spine should be done prior to treatment. Myelography should be reserved for those patients who cannot undergo a technically adequate or expeditious MRI study. The convenience of MRI relative to myelography allows clinicians to diagnose actual or impending spinal cord compression earlier. High-dose steroids (dexamethasone) should be instituted immediately, and endocrine therapy should be started if not already in use. Ambulatory and moderately paraparetic patients seem best treated initially with radiation alone. Immediate surgical decompression should be used in patients with an expected lifespan of at least 6 months who deteriorate during radiation, who have had previous radiation to the involved site, or who have a potentially correctable unstable spine. In addition, paraplegic patients or severely paraparetic patients with recent neurologic deterioration should be treated with immediate surgical decompression if they are judged reasonably able to tolerate the surgery. These patients should then receive postoperative radiation treatment. 
3	Mechanical ventilation in medical and neurological diseases: 11 years of experience. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is imperative in many forms of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The aim of this work was to review all episodes of MV in a Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) during the 11-year period 1976-1986. Four per cent (n = 1008) of 24,899 admissions to the MICU were treated with MV. The mean age of ventilator-treated patients was 53 +/- 18 years, and obviously it increased during the period of study. The average duration of MV was 4.7 d. MICU mortality, hospital mortality and 2-year mortality rates for patients subjected to MV were 33%, 38% and 46%, respectively. The mortality rate did not change during the study period. Cerebrovascular and malignant diseases carried the highest mortality rates, 75 and 79%, respectively, whereas mortality in patients ventilated because of drug overdose (n = 313) was only 2%. The results of this study confirm previously published findings concerning the outcome of MV, and we conclude that the effects of MV remain discouraging in medical and neurological patients. Improved quality of ventilator therapy and monitoring, as well as continued research directed at the causes of ARF, are equally important in reducing the mortality in ARF. 
3	Postencephalitic acquired Tourette-like syndrome in a child. We report a 6-year-old girl who developed a Tourette-like syndrome following presumed herpes encephalitis. This case suggests that tics can be acquired in childhood and may be associated with lesions involving basal ganglia or limbic circuitry. 
1	End stage renal disease serum contains a specific renal cell growth factor. End stage renal disease (ESRD) kidneys display abnormal growth characterized by a continuum of cystic disease, adenoma and carcinoma. This study evaluates the hypothesis that serum of patients with ESRD contains increased amounts of a growth factor which specifically induces proliferation of renal cells. ESRD sera compared to sera from normal controls induced a two to three-fold increase in the proliferative rate of renal cell carcinoma cell lines and normal kidney explants compared to cell lines from other sites. The increased proliferative activity of ESRD sera on renal cells was paralleled by an increase in cytosolic free calcium. The growth factor activity was encoded by a polypeptide of between 15 and 30 kd. The activity of ESRD sera on renal cells was not mimicked or inhibited by epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet derived growth factor indicating that the renal cell specific growth factor activity in ESRD is different from these factors. 
4	Lung beta-adrenoceptors in pulmonary hypertension. A study of biopsy specimens in children with congenital heart disease. Characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors were analyzed using radioligand-binding techniques with 3H-dihydroalprenolol in lung specimens from 11 children with pulmonary hypertension (median age, three years) undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart defects and four pediatric control subjects (median age, five years) undergoing thoracotomy for removal of neoplasms or cysts. Scatchard analysis of 3H-DHA binding to lung membranes showed similar values of the dissociation constant in both groups (Kd = 0.72 +/- 0.22 nM in patients vs 1.22 +/- 0.22 nM in controls; p = NS). The receptor density was significantly increased in patients in comparison with controls, with respective values of 164 +/- 19 and 95 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein (p less than 0.025), and correlated directly with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.82; p less than 0.0005). No significant relationship was observed between receptor number and pulmonary arterial medial thickness. Thus, the increase in receptor density in these patients may be related to adaptative changes in cells other than vascular smooth muscle. 
1	Calcium ionophore, A23187, induces commitment to differentiation but inhibits the subsequent expression of erythroid genes in murine erythroleukemia cells. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are a useful model for studying the processes that regulate erythroid differentiation because exposure of these cells to a variety of chemical inducing agents results in expression of erythroid-specific genes and the resultant loss of cellular immortality. Previously it has been suggested that the calcium ionophore, A23187, has effects on the early cellular events that lead to the commitment of these cells to differentiation, but was not in itself sufficient to induce differentiation. We demonstrate here that A23187, as well as another calcium ionophore, ionomycin, are capable of inducing commitment to differentiation. Unlike other inducing agents, continual exposure to A23187 inhibits transcription of the erythroid-specific genes, beta-globin and Band 3. This effect is not attributable to an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, because cells induced by ionomycin produce normal amounts of hemoglobin. These effects of A23187 on MEL cells confirm that commitment to differentiation is a distinct event from the subsequent transcriptional activation of erythroid genes. The ability of both ionophores to induce commitment to differentiation suggests that an increase in cytosolic calcium can trigger commitment to differentiation. These agents should prove useful in investigating the cellular processes that are responsible for commitment to differentiation. 
1	Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (parapsoriasis en plaque). An association with pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta in young children. Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) and pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) are related benign disorders without recognized association with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We report the cases of two children with documented PLEVA evolving into CTCL over several years. One child had the clinical lesions of PLC but the dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA at age 2 years. At age 12 years, he had skin changes of poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare and dermatopathologic findings consistent with parapsoriasis en plaque. The second child presented at age 7 years with scaling dermatitis and dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA. At age 12 years, the histologic diagnosis was parapsoriasis. Monoclonal antibody studies performed on biopsy specimens from both patients revealed 70% to 100% cells staining with CD5, 80% to 90% staining with CD4, 30% to 50% staining with CD8, and an increase in CD1-staining cells in the papillary dermis, indicating a predominantly helper T-cell infiltrate. We believe that PLC and PLEVA may be part of the spectrum of CTCL. Furthermore, CTCL may be more common in young children than once thought. 
4	Vasodilatory beta-blockers: systemic and regional hemodynamic effects. The systemic and regional hemodynamic alterations in hypertension and of the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents are reviewed. Hemodynamically, hypertension may be regarded as persistent elevation of arterial pressure associated with increased total peripheral resistance. In early or mild essential hypertension, however, increased total peripheral resistance may not readily be recognized because of the overriding effect of increased cardiac output. Clearly, the hemodynamics of blood pressure control are complex, and the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents must be used appropriately. The early beta-blockers reduced heart rate and cardiac output immediately after intravenous administration without immediately reducing arterial pressure, and calculated total peripheral resistance was increased. With prolonged oral treatment, arterial pressure decreased while maintaining a reduced heart rate and cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance, however, remained elevated. Recent beta-blockers, such as celiprolol, provide an improved physiologic response by instantly reducing arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance without reducing heart rate or cardiac output or expanding intravascular volume. 
1	Serial CA 125 levels during chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of serial CA 125 in monitoring disease status during chemotherapy in women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. CA 125 was measured in 21 women receiving cisplatin, etoposide, and Adriamycin for a total of 275 courses of chemotherapy (median eight). Eight of ten patients had elevated pre-therapy CA 125 levels (median 233 U/mL). CA 125 became and/or remained negative in all 20 women with responding or stable disease and was elevated in all nine patients who relapsed. The median level at the time of relapse was 56 U/mL. Levels were elevated before clinical relapse in five of nine patients (56%). Serial CA 125 may aid in the management of women receiving chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
4	Rapid expression of heat shock protein in the rabbit after brief cardiac ischemia. The effect of brief myocardial ischemia on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP 70) was examined in an in vivo rabbit model of myocardial ischemia using Northern blotting. Functional studies were carried out in the open-chested anesthetized rabbit. The large marginal branch of the left circumflex was occluded four times for 5 min. Using piezoelectric crystals implanted midwall in the ischemic zone, end-diastolic length, end-systolic length, and percent segmental shortening were assessed. Expression of HSP 70 was measured by Northern blotting. A single 5-min coronary occlusion doubled the expression of HSP 70 whereas four cycles of 5 min of ischemia/5 min of reperfusion resulted in a threefold increase in HSP 70 mRNA (P less than 0.001). Measurements with the piezoelectric crystals showed mild myocardial dysfunction concomitant with the increase in HSP 70. This increase in HSP 70 mRNA after repetitive brief ischemia was transient, occurring as early as 1 h and returning to baseline by 24 h after ischemia. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to HSP 70 was used to compare sham and postischemic myocardial HSP 70 levels. Changes in the amount of HSP 70 were evident as early as 2 h and were even more striking at 24 h. 
4	Prevalence of aortic regurgitation by color flow Doppler in relation to aortic root size. To determine whether there is a correlation between aortic root size and the prevalence of aortic regurgitation, we performed color flow Doppler echocardiographic studies on 1015 consecutive patients during a 3-month period. Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position. The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm, grouped at 0.1 cm intervals. As the aortic root size enlarged, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient, r = 0.75). At an aortic root size in the "small normal" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%. In the "intermediate" and "top normal" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%. With aortic root dilation, the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%. The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified. Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation. Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes. Throughout the range of aortic root sizes, mild aortic regurgitation predominated. We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the "top normal" size range, that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size, and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation. 
2	A prospective comparison of laser therapy and intubation in endoscopic palliation for malignant dysphagia. There is little objective long-term follow-up comparing laser therapy with intubation for palliation of malignant dysphagia. In a prospective, nonrandomized two-center trial 43 patients treated with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser were compared with 30 patients treated by endoscopic intubation; the two groups were comparable for mean age and tumor position, length, and histology. Dysphagia was graded from 0 to 4 (0, normal swallowing; 4, dysphagia for liquids). Pretreatment mean dysphagia grades were similar: laser-treated group, 2.9 (SD, 0.6); intubated group, 3.2 (SD, 0.55). For thoracic esophageal tumors, the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in dysphagia grade by greater than or equal to 1 grade initially and over the long term was similar (laser, 95% and 77%; intubation, 100% and 86%). For tumors crossing the cardia, intubation was significantly better (laser, 59% and 50%; intubation, 100% and 92%, respectively; P less than 0.001). In patients palliated over a long period, however, the mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their lives (mean survival: laser, 6.1 months; intubation, 5.1 months) was better in the laser group (1.6 vs. 2.0; P less than 0.01); 33% of laser-treated and 11% of intubated patients could eat most or all solids (P less than 0.05). For long-term palliation, laser-treated patients required on average more procedures (4.6 vs. 1.4; P less than 0.05) and days in the hospital (14 vs. 9; P less than 0.05). The perforation rate was lower in the laser-treated group (2% vs. 13%; P less than 0.02); no treatment-related deaths occurred in either group. For individual patients, the best results are likely to be achieved when the two techniques are used in a complementary fashion in specialist centers. 
3	Brain microemboli during cardiac surgery or aortography We have observed many focal dilatations or very small aneurysms in terminal arterioles and capillaries of 4 of 5 patients and 6 dogs who had recently undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. A smaller number of sausagelike dilatations distended medium-sized arterioles. Two other patients had a small number of the same microvascular changes following proximal aortography. Thirty-four patients and 6 dogs not undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had none. (A 35th patient who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass or aortography showed a small number of dilatations; mediastinal air was a suggested source.) Some of the dilatations exhibited various forms of birefringence. Because most of the dilatations appear empty, we speculate that they are the sites of gas bubbles or fat emboli that have been removed by the solvents used in processing. These microvascular events, occurring only in conjunction with major arterial interventions, may be the anatomical correlate of the neurological deficits or moderate to severe intellectual dysfunction seen in at least 24% of patients after cardiac surgical procedures assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass. 
5	The effects of rate, sequencing, and memory on auditory processing in the elderly. Auditory sequencing, rate, and memory were evaluated in three age groups with a series of subtests that require the identification of tones (Repetition Test; Tallal & Piercy, 1973). The older elderly group (M age = 80), but not the younger elderly group (M age = 70), performed significantly (p less than .05) poorer than the young adult group (M age = 25) when auditory memory of 4 and 5 tones was required and when the interstimulus interval was decreased. Performance was not related to hearing sensitivity, thus suggesting that changes in the auditory mechanism that occur with age may encompass more than a loss of hearing sensitivity. Moreover, performance on the Repetition Test did correlate with memory for digits, which indicates a relationship between auditory processing and higher cortical functions. 
3	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from allogeneic dura: a review of risks and safety. Surgeons and the lay public have recently expressed concern over the safety of allogeneic dura as it relates to the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Indeed, two cases have resulted from use of tissue procured from a commercial agency that did not adhere to criteria accepted by the American Association of Tissue Banks or the Southeast Organ Procurement Foundation. This review discusses the risks and safety of allogeneic dura. The findings should reassure the surgeon of the safety of allogeneic dura when it is properly processed and catalogued by a bona fide, reputable tissue bank. To date, there have been no documented cases reported to the Center for Disease Control in which Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease was transmitted from allogeneic dura obtained from a registered tissue bank. 
5	Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies with technetium-99m-red blood cells: utility of a second injection. Two patients studied with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) for gastrointestinal bleeding had positive findings only on 24-hr delayed images, at which time the site of bleeding could not be ascertained. In each instance, when additional delayed images suggested that active bleeding was occurring, a second aliquot of RBCs was labeled and injected. Sites of active hemorrhage were identified following further imaging in both patients. When delayed GI bleeding images are positive, further views should be obtained to ascertain if the pattern of intraluminal activity changes. If renewed active hemorrhage is suspected, reinjection with a second dose of labeled RBCs may identify the bleeding site. 
4	Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina. The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group). Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries. 
5	Enhanced reactive oxygen species metabolism of airspace cells and airway inflammation follow antigen challenge in human asthma. Airflow limitation and airway inflammation follow antigen bronchoprovocation in sensitized individuals. Inflammation likely results from the interplay of several previously demonstrated factors, but the participation and persistence of enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of airspace cells after antigen challenge have received more limited attention. We studied nine subjects with mild asthma by bronchoalveolar lavage before and 48 (one subject) to 72 (eight subjects) hours after antigen bronchoprovocation and compared airspace cell numbers and types, cell function, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins. Mild, but significant, airflow limitation persisted at the time of the second lavage. Eosinophil influx was a notable component of the increased airspace cells in postchallenge lavages. Airspace cells demonstrated significantly enhanced ROS metabolism, and total protein, albumin, and IgM levels were higher in postchallenge lavage specimens. Antigen bronchial challenge produces airspace inflammation, which may develop, in part, as a consequence of enhanced ROS metabolism of airspace cells. 
5	Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease without periodic EEG activity. Four members of a kindred with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are reported, in whom myoclonus did not develop and in whom serial electroencephalograms performed late in their illness failed to show periodic sharp wave complexes. Otherwise, the patients' disease duration, clinical features, and neuropathological findings were similar to those described in sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Our findings and those reported by others suggest that periodic electroencephalographic activity may be rare in familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as it is in other slow transmissible encephalopathies. 
5	Rapid histological changes in endomyocardial biopsy specimens after myocarditis. The course and response to treatment in acute lymphocytic myocarditis are conventionally monitored by endomyocardial biopsy performed every 3-12 weeks. A patient with a short history (five days) of acute myopericarditis of unknown aetiology presented in cardiogenic shock with evidence of severe systolic dysfunction on the echocardiogram. The initial biopsy specimen showed histologically unequivocal myocarditis. Repeat endomyocardial biopsy after four days of treatment with steroids and azathioprine showed substantial histological improvement, a reduction in cellular infiltrate and myocardial necrosis, and interstitial fibrosis. Serial biopsies at 2 weeks and then 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 14 months after the initial biopsy showed progressive clearing of cellular infiltrate, increasing interstitial fibrosis, and compensatory myocyte hypertrophy by 4 months. At 14 months scattered lymphocytes persisted but myocyte abnormalities had resolved completely. The patient remained symptom free and systolic function was normal during this recovery period. Early endomyocardial biopsy (within one week of diagnosis) may yield useful histological information on the response to treatment in patients with myocarditis. It may not be necessary to wait the customary 3-4 weeks to repeat the biopsy. This case shows the chronology of histological changes and emphasises that a return to normal myocardial function may precede resolution of the histological abnormalities, which may persist in part or may resolve totally after the acute episode. 
5	Audiological findings following head trauma. Traumatic head injury is the principal cause of death and serious physical disability in adolescents and young adult. Hearing loss is a common sequela of head trauma. The results of pure tone and auditory brain-stem response (ABR) assessment of minor head injury revealed that 20 per cent of these cases showed impairment of hearing including both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss mostly in the high frequencies loss. ABR findings showed a significant difference of absolute wave V latency and interwave (III-V) latencies at repetition rate 11.1 click/sec., and a highly significant difference at a repetition rate of 51.1 click/sec., compared with the control group. In severe head injury, conductive hearing loss was found in only one case, in which a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone was identified radiologically. No ABR could be recorded at a repetition rate of 11.1 click/sec. in either ear of this case; this patient died a few days later. Three cases were found with a mixed sensorineural hearing loss; one of them showed a longitudinal fracture radiologically. ABR findings in two cases showed prolongation of wave V and I-V interwave latencies, and the third case showed absence of ABR recording. In comatose patients, an ABR grading system is a more sensitive index of brainstem dysfunction than the simple division of normal versus abnormal ABR waves and interwave latencies. Presence or prolongation of wave V and interwave latency I-V even in one ear is of good prognostic value in the comatosed patient. 
5	Cobb's collar--a forgotten entity. Cobb's collar or Moormann's ring is a stricture of the bulbar urethra which is largely unrecognised but has considerable relevance urologically as the site of congenital or post-instrumental strictures. The history, anatomy, embryology and surgical importance are reported. 
1	The Lewis X antigen. A new paraffin section marker for Reed-Sternberg cells. Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the Lewis X antigen (anti-Lex), the authors studied 103 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) in comparison with 57 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); three cases of granulocytic sarcoma (GS); two cases of malignant histiocytosis (MH); one case of monoblastic leukemia (ML); one case of interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma (IRCS); six cases of histiocytosis X (HX); one case of reticulohistiocytoma (RH); 44 various reactive conditions of the lymph node (LN). Reed-Sternberg and related (R-S) cells stained selectively in 80 of 92 cases of HD (87.0%), excluding 11 cases of lymphocyte predominance type. The stain was better in B-5-fixed specimens than in formalin-fixed specimens, showing a dense deposit of reaction products at a paranuclear site and on the cell surface. The staining results were compared with those of Leu-M1 and found to be superior both qualitatively and quantitatively (detection rate of R-S cells: 87.0% versus 68.5% of Leu-M1). Granulocytes, rare epithelioid histiocytes, and some endothelial and/or erythrocytes also stained with anti-Lex. The stain had positive results in three cases of GS showing a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern. Of NHL, two of 29 peripheral T-cell lymphomas stained to show rare paranuclear deposits without cell surface staining. The stain had negative results in MH, ML, IRCS, HX, and RH. Of 45 reactive LN, minute subcapsular collections of Lewis X+, altered-appearing Langerhans'-like cells, were observed in all ten LN from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). The stain had negative results in all other various reactive conditions of LN. In conclusion, Lewis X staining is useful as a marker for R-S cells in paraffin sections with staining results superior to those of Leu-M1. Lewis X staining also detects subcapsular clustering of altered-appearing Langerhans'-like cells in PGL, which has not been described previously and warrants additional study. 
5	Sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome in the Mariana Islands. Sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is a distinct clinical entity in previously healthy, young, Southeast Asian males. It is well known in the Philippines and more recently recognized in the U.S. by nonspecific autopsy findings, with no evidence of underlying disease and absence of toxic drug or alcohol levels. In 1973-89, 14 cases of apparent SUNDS came to coroner's autopsy in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas (CNMI) and Guam. All 14 cases, with the exception of one Yapese, were previously healthy, male Filipinos, aged 23 to 55, who were either found dead in bed, or described by their colleagues as having nocturnal seizure activity consisting of gurgling, frothing, and tongue biting immediately prior to death. Autopsy findings showed no anatomic findings to account for death. Comprehensive serum and urine drug analyses were negative. All decedents showed absence of significant atherosclerosis or grossly detectable structural cardiac anomaly, while four showed cardiomegaly. Migrants from Southeast Asia carry with them a pre-disposition to this syndrome, which appears to decline with longer residence in the new country. The mechanism of death in SUNDS is believed to be ventricular fibrillation, possibly precipitated by sudden sympathetic discharge. Studies suggest at least some deaths may be associated with an abnormal cardiac conduction system. Acute pancreatitis has been a finding in some series, but not our cases. Why the condition is virtually limited to males and seemingly sleep-triggered, has not been adequately explained. Stress and depression are believed to be predisposing factors. 
4	Physical fitness and cardiovascular regulation: mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance. We studied three groups of eight men each--high, mid, and low fit (peak O2 consumption 60.0 +/- 0.8, 48.9 +/- 1.0, and 35.7 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1)--to determine the mechanism of orthostatic intolerance in endurance athletes. Tolerance was defined by progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to presyncope. Maximal calf vascular conductance (Gmax) was measured. The carotid baroreflex was characterized using both stepwise R-wave-triggered and sustained (2 min) changes in neck chamber pressure. High-fit subjects tended to have lower LBNP tolerance than mid- and low-fit subjects but similar baroreflex responses. Subjects with poor LBNP tolerance had larger stroke volumes (SV) (120 +/- 6 vs. 103 +/- 3 ml) and greater decline in SV with LBNP to -40 mmHg (40 +/- 2 vs. 26 +/- 4%). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Gmax and steady-state gain of the carotid baroreflex contributed significantly toward explaining interindividual variations in LBNP tolerance. Thus endurance athletes may have decreased LBNP tolerance, but apparently not as a simple linear function of aerobic fitness. Orthostatic tolerance depends on complex interactions among functional characteristics that appear both related (Gmax and SV) and unrelated (baroreflex function) to fitness or exercise training. 
3	Continuous postoperative regional analgesia by nerve sheath block for amputation surgery--a pilot study. A pilot study of continuous postoperative regional analgesia by nerve sheath block for lower limb amputation is presented. At the time of exposure of sciatic or posterior tibial nerve trunks during above- or below-knee amputations in 11 patients with ASA physical status III or IV, a catheter was introduced directly into the transected nerve sheath for continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine at a rate of 10 mL/h for 72 h. Effective amputation stump analgesia was obtained, significantly reducing the need for on-demand narcotic analgesics during this time to a mean dose equivalent of 1.4 mg of morphine compared with a retrospective control group who received the equivalent of a mean dose of 18.4 mg of morphine (P less than 0.0001). No complications related to the technique were observed. A follow-up of the group receiving continuous postoperative regional analgesia for up to 12 mo showed a total absence of phantom pain despite the presence of preoperative limb pain. 
2	Adult hepatic fibropolycystic disease presenting as obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the common hepatic duct by a simple hepatic cyst in a 31 year old Europid man is reported. The jaundice and duct compression resolved after percutaneous aspiration of the cyst under ultrasound direction and the patient has been well for 12 months. 
1	Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary glands: a reappraisal of the influence of tumor differentiation on prognosis. Thirty-nine cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary glands were reviewed for a reappraisal of the influence of the grade of differentiation on the outcome of the disease. The age of the patients ranged between 7 and 84 years. Fifteen patients were females and 24 males. The tumors were located at the parotid gland (n = 30), the submaxillary gland (n = 1), the soft palate (n = 5) and the oral mucosa NOS (n = 3). At presentation 4 tumors were intraglandular and 35 extraglandular; three patients had lymph node metastases and one patient lung metastases. The grade of differentiation was assessed using the criteria of Healey et al. Twelve tumors were classified as grade I, 17 as grade II, and 10 as grade III. Follow-up information was obtained with a duration of 5-144 months (mean 44.7 months). Six cases recurred locally and 5 developed metastases. Five years cumulative survival was 100% for grade I, 70.1% for grade II, and 47.2% for grade III. The results point to the usefulness of the assessment of the grade of differentiation as a guide to anticipate the outcome of the disease. 
5	Use of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 for in vitro diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. We have studied the effects of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on the in vitro halothane test in 10 malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS), 12 MH "equivocal" to halothane (MHEh), 30 MH non-susceptible (MHN) and 10 control patients. BAY K 8644 potentiated the halothane-induced contracture in muscle strips from both MHS and MHEh patients. The drug produced a more obvious difference in contracture responses between the MHEh group compared with the MHN and control groups. 
2	Effect of oxygen-free radical scavengers on survival in sepsis. Sepsis remains a leading cause of death in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patient following major surgery or trauma. Recent work has demonstrated that oxygen-free radicals (OFR) generated during sepsis contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of various new free radical scavengers on survival in sepsis. A total of 85 male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of the following treatment groups. CONTROL: cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); PRE-AT: pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol (AT) 10 mg/100 gm SC x 3 days, and 5 mg/100 gm IV prior to CLP; AT: 20 mg/100 gm at time of CLP and 4 hours following CLP; U74006F: (21-aminosteroid which inhibits lipid peroxidation) 3 mg/kg IV at the time of and 4 hours following CLP; U78517F: (alpha-tocopherol analogue) 3 mg/kg at the time of and 4 hours following CLP. Survival was determined at various time points up to 72 hours. Pretreatment with AT resulted in improved survival, whereas the novel OFR scavengers U78517F and U74006F significantly improved survival and were efficacious without pretreatment. It was concluded that OFR scavengers can improve survival in sepsis. 
3	Dystonia in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism is a syndrome in search of a pathology. We therefore reviewed the literature on dystonic manifestations in autopsy-proven cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Only 6 of 140 autopsy reports of MSA remarked on the presence of dystonia in life, but personal observations suggest prominent antecollis may develop at some stage in up to 1/2 of sufferers. Similarly, very few (15/118) clinicopathologic observations on PSP included convincing dystonic manifestations, in contrast to some clinical reports where blepharospasm and early limb dystonia were prominent. Virtually any form of focal and segmental dystonia may sometimes occur with clinically diagnosed PD, with occasional descriptions of hemidystonia-hemiparkinsonism. However, there is pathologic confirmation of this diagnosis in only 1 case. With many patients thought clinically to have PD proving pathologically to have another cause for their parkinsonism, the true frequency and the range of dystonic manifestations acceptable in PD remain unknown. 
1	Extended hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. The results of extended hepatectomy in 25 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma performed over a 16 year period have been reviewed, analysed and compared with those of 144 patients who underwent lesser liver resection. Five left and 20 right extended hepatectomies were performed for tumours ranging from 3 to 20 cm in diameter. Seventeen (68 per cent) of the patients had non-cirrhotic livers. The major postoperative complications were: haemorrhage in five cases, major bile duct injury in three, subphrenic abscess in two, liver failure in one and wound dehiscence in one. The 30-day (operative) mortality rate was 12 per cent and the median survival duration, including operative mortality, was 9.7 (range 0.2-32.1) months. The survival rate was 46 per cent at 1 year, 33 per cent at 2 years and 22 per cent at 3 years. The morbidity, mortality and survival data of extended hepatectomy were comparable with the results of lesser hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma. We conclude that extended hepatectomy is a worthwhile operation for large hepatocellular carcinomas and a viable alternative to liver transplantation. 
1	Superficial bladder cancer in patients under 40 years of age. Efficacy of topical prophylaxis. In patients under the age of 40 years with primary superficial bladder cancer the efficacy of adjuvant topical treatment was the same as in elderly patients (recurrences 23%, progression rate 8%). Patients should therefore be treated on the basis of stage and grade of the tumour regardless of their age. 
3	Manual stretch: effect on finger movement control and force control in stroke subjects with spastic extrinsic finger flexor muscles. This study evaluated the effects of manual stretch of extrinsic finger flexor muscles on finger extension movement control and force control in 16 spastic hemiparetic subjects. These subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. A group of able-bodied subjects also participated. A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range. Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests. Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests. The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03). The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls. However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups. Manual stretch treatment, properly applied to extrinsic finger flexor muscles, is an effective method of temporarily improving the control of finger extension movement in spastic hemiparetic subjects. 
1	Cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma. Apart from choriocarcinoma, involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by gynecologic malignancy is rare. A 10-year retrospective review at the University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA) and Swedish Hospital and Medical Center Tumor Registry (Seattle, WA) identified 14 patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma. Median age at diagnosis of cerebral metastases was 52.5 years. Median interval from the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma to the diagnosis of CNS metastases was 14.5 months. Seven patients had received cisplatin therapy before CNS relapse. Seven patients underwent second-look procedures before developing CNS metastases; in three, results were negative. Eight patients had evidence of extraperitoneal spread to other sites at the time of CNS relapse. Clinical manifestations included motor weakness, seizures, headache, confusion, and speech disturbance. All lesions were contrast enhancing on computed tomography (CT) scans and were located in the cerebral hemispheres. Nine patients had single lesions, five of whom underwent surgical resection of the lesion with histologic confirmation of metastases from the primary site. Median survival was 2 months in patients receiving radiation therapy alone and 17 months in patients who received surgery and radiation. Median survival of the entire series was 3 months. The presence of multiple cerebral metastases or evidence of extraperitoneal spread elsewhere in the body was adversely associated with survival. The prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma appears poor. However, early diagnosis by routine CT scanning followed by surgical resection and radiation may improve overall survival in a select group of patients. 
1	Pheochromocytoma presenting as rhabdomyolysis and acute myoglobinuric renal failure. We report the case of a previously healthy young woman who presented with the sudden onset of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal failure, requiring hemodialysis for 3 weeks. Common causes of rhabdomyolysis were ruled out; as renal function returned, severe hypertension was noted and a pheochromocytoma was diagnosed. We suggest that pheochromocytoma causes rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria via catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction and skeletal muscle ischemia. 
4	Treatment of acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage with serial lumbar puncture. Computed tomography demonstrated acute hydrocephalus less than or equal to 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 24 (23%) of 104 patients. Of these 24 patients, six (25%) had no impairment of consciousness. In nine (11%) of the remaining 80 patients, acute hydrocephalus developed within 1 week after subarachnoid hemorrhage. With the exception of three patients, all 104 patients received antifibrinolytic treatment. Delayed clinical deterioration from acute hydrocephalus occurred in seven (29%) of the 24 patients with acute hydrocephalus on admission and in six (8%) of the remaining 80 patients. Serial lumbar puncture was performed in 17 patients. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients treated with serial lumbar puncture, including 10 (77%) of the 13 patients with delayed deterioration from acute hydrocephalus after admission, achieved improvement in the level of consciousness. Four of these 17 patients (4% of all 104 patients) required an internal shunt. No patient deteriorated from coning following serial lumbar puncture. The rebleeding rate within 12 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage in hydrocephalic patients with serial lumbar puncture was not higher than the rate in those without hydrocephalus (two [12%] of 17 versus nine [13%] of 71). Neither meningitis nor ventriculitis was observed. We conclude that if neither a hematoma with a mass effect nor an obstructive element exists, cerebrospinal fluid drainage with serial lumbar puncture is a good alternative to ventricular drainage in patients with acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
1	Genotypic characterization of centrocytic lymphoma: frequent rearrangement of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Centrocytic lymphomas are defined in the Kiel classification as B-cell lymphomas composed exclusively of cells resembling cleaved follicular center cells (FCC). These lymphomas have been shown to be histologically, immunophenotypically, and clinically distinct from other cleaved FCC lymphomas. DNA from 18 centrocytic lymphomas (14 patients) was analyzed using Southern blotting and probes for immunoglobulin heavy (JH) and kappa light chain (JK) joining gene, T-cell receptor beta chain constant gene (CB), bcl-1, bcl-2, and c-myc gene rearrangements. All of the lymphomas had JH and JK rearrangements, confirming their B-cell origin. None of the specimens had detectable CB, bcl-2, or c-myc rearrangements. However, 4 of 14 patients (28.6%) had rearrangement of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Therefore, centrocytic lymphomas are genotypically distinguishable from the majority of other small cleaved FCC lymphomas by their lack of demonstrable bcl-2 rearrangements. This supports the distinct nature of centrocytic lymphomas and suggests the lack of importance for the putative oncogene bcl-2 in these cases. Furthermore, the frequent rearrangement of bcl-1 suggests a possible role for this locus in the pathogenesis of at least some centrocytic lymphomas. 
3	Syncope of unknown origin: clinical, noninvasive, and electrophysiologic determinants of arrhythmia induction and symptom recurrence during long-term follow-up. Ninety-one consecutive patients with syncope of unknown origin underwent electrophysiologic studies (EPS). Univariate analysis identified the following variables: age, + signal-averaged ECG (SAECG), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and history of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) on Holter; multivariate analysis identified +SAECG, LVEF, and history of SMVT as risk factors for induction of SMVT at EPS. All patients were followed up for 19.0 +/- 8.3 months and 17 had recurrence of syncope. Patients were divided into empiric, EP-guided, and no therapy groups. The EP-guided therapy group included all patients with SMVT at EPS. Recurrence rates among all three groups were similar. We conclude that: (1) Patients who have inducible SMVT at EPS can be identified using certain clinical and noninvasive variables. When these patients undergo EP-guided therapy, their rate of recurrence of syncope becomes compatible with that of patients who had no arrhythmia induced at EPS. (2) Empiric therapy does not offer any benefit over no therapy in reducing the rate of recurrent of scope. 
2	Preventing colorectal cancer. Knowledgeable patients should not die of colorectal cancer. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber, decreasing fat consumption, and increasing the use of modern technology to detect adenomatous polyps and early cancer can greatly decrease the mortality associated with colorectal cancer. 
5	Endothelial cell biology. The endothelium is not a passive blood-compatible lining for the containment of blood cells and plasma, but rather it is a metabolically active tissue that subserves a wide range of functions relating to vascular homeostasis. This article reviews the current understanding of endothelial cell biology in terms of the molecules and biochemical pathways involved. These regulate coagulant and thrombotic properties of the vessel wall, vascular tone, and hence blood flow and pressure; changes in solute permeability and leukocyte traffic during the generation of inflammatory and immune responses; and finally the processes of vessel growth and angiogenesis. The review concludes with a consideration of how these functional properties can be disturbed, and their possible consequences, in response to irradiation, intravascular contrast media, or angioplasty. 
5	Anchorage-independent growth and the expression of cellular proto-oncogenes in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and in human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. The expression of multiple cellular proto-oncogenes and the in vitro anchorage-independent growth of normal human epidermal keratinocytes and several human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were studied and correlated. Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines KB, Si Ha, HEp-2, and Fa Du showed high anchorage independency, and MS 751 and A-253 cell lines had minimum independency. However, the normal keratinocytes and the A-431 cell line did not show anchorage-independent growth. Both the normal human epidermal keratinocytes and cancer cell lines expressed multiple proto-oncogenes such as src, erb B-1, abl, fos, raf, H-ras, and myc, and the amount of expression of these oncogenes was notably higher in the cancer cell lines than in the normal keratinocytes. The expression of proto-oncogenes from the monolayer cultures of the cancer cell lines is poorly correlated with the anchorage independency of the cells. These data indicate that the anchorage independency is not directly linked to the expression of specific cellular proto-oncogene(s) of the monolayer cancer cell cultures. 
2	Prognostic determinants in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure in newborns. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is becoming an accepted therapeutic modality for newborn respiratory failure, but there is little information available regarding the prognostic determinants with this technique. One hundred thirty-five newborns treated with ECMO over a 4-year period were critically analyzed with regard to the influence that birth weight, gestational age, age at initiation of ECMO, best blood gases before ECMO, number of hours on ECMO, renal failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, and long-distance air transport had on survival. Infants with meconium aspiration and those undergoing long-distance transfer showed significant differences in blood gases before ECMO, with survivors having more normal pH and carbon dioxide tension values. Intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure that developed during ECMO were grave prognostic signs, with few survivors in either group. These data show that ability to ventilate patients before ECMO, giving normal carbon dioxide tension and pH values, is an important prognostic sign in infants with meconium aspiration and undergoing long-distance transfer for ECMO, whereas renal failure and intracerebral hemorrhage are usually lethal complications of ECMO. Each center performing ECMO should continually reevaluate this invasive technique and its results and complications. 
4	What is the best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and sudden death after myocardial infarction? BACKGROUND. Death during the first year after myocardial infarction is most commonly due to spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF). The purpose of this study was to compare, in a single cohort of patients, the values of inducible VT, delayed ventricular activation, low left ventricular ejection fraction, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and ST segment displacement on exercise in predicting electrical events (witnessed instantaneous death and spontaneous VT or VF) during the first year after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three hundred sixty one patients aged less than 71 years underwent electrophysiological study, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, gated blood-pool scan, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and exercise testing 1-2 weeks after myocardial infarction and were then followed up for at least 1 year. There were 34 deaths (eight witnessed instantaneous, 26 other), and nine patients survived one or more episodes of spontaneous VF or VT. Patients with inducible VT were 15.2 times more likely to suffer electrical events than patients without inducible VT. No proportional-hazards model excluding inducible VT was as good a predictor of electrical events as was inducible VT alone. CONCLUSIONS. Inducible VT at electrophysiological study was the single best predictor of spontaneous VT and sudden death after myocardial infarction. 
4	Effects of retrovenous myocardial drug delivery after coronary artery occlusion in sheep. Retrovenous (RV) myocardial delivery of blood and drugs into the coronary sinus (CS) through a 3 lumen balloon catheter was evaluated in sheep (no coronary collaterals) for protection from ventricular fibrillation (VF) during coronary artery occlusion. The balloon was asynchronously inflated (CS occlusion) for 5 sec and then deflated for 5 sec with 1 cc/sec of flow. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded with inflation of a percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography balloon and therapy started immediately. In a control group (no therapy, n = 4) all developed VF by 30 min after coronary artery occlusion. The drugs lidocaine (L), esmolol (E), adenosine (A), and deferoxamine (D) were evaluated for effects on eliminating developing VF with intravenous (i.v.) administration compared with RV administration with venous blood (VB) or arterial blood (AB). The percent survival after CA occlusion (no VF) was: L i.v., 0%; L RV with VB, 43%; L RV with AB, 17%; E i.v., 50%; E RV with VB, 70%; A. i.v., 29%; A RV with VB, 88%; D i.v., 17%; and D RV with AB, 80%. There was a trend toward lower myocardial necrosis (seen by tetrazolium stain and/or light microscopy) in the RV survivors (especially with VB) compared with the group i.v. survivors. These data suggest that RV antiarrhythmic drug delivery is a feasible alternative to i.v. administration during CA occlusion. 
2	Rice-based oral electrolyte solutions for the management of infantile diarrhea BACKGROUND. In infants the treatment of acute diarrhea with glucose-based solutions results in rehydration but does not reduce the severity of diarrhea. Oral rehydration with solutions based on rice powder may reduce stool output as well as restore fluid volume. METHODS. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of two rice-based rehydration solutions and a conventional glucose-based solution. Solution A contained only rice-syrup solids, solution B contained rice-syrup solids and casein hydrolysate, and solution C, the glucose-based solution, served as control. The study subjects were 86 mildly to moderately dehydrated infant boys, 3 to 18 months old, who were admitted to a children's hospital with acute diarrhea. We measured fluid intake, fecal and urine output, and absorption and retention of fluid, sodium, and potassium at intervals for 48 hours in all 86 infants. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SE) fecal output was significantly lower in the infants given solution A (group A infants) than in the infants given solution C (group C) (29 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 7 ml per kilogram of body weight, P less than 0.05) during the first six hours of therapy. The infants in group A also had greater fluid absorption (221 +/- 16 vs. 167 +/- 9 ml per kilogram, P less than 0.05) over the entire 48 hours of therapy and greater potassium absorption (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol per kilogram, P less than 0.05) during the first six hours than the infants in group C. Solution B offered no advantages over solution A. CONCLUSIONS. Solutions containing rice-syrup solids were effective in the rehydration of infants with acute diarrhea. They decreased stool output and promoted greater absorption and retention of fluid and electrolytes than did a glucose-based solution. 
3	Brain imaging abnormalities in mental disorders of late life. Psychiatric inpatients with dementia (N = 61) or depression (N = 67) in late life were 2.6 times more likely to manifest magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the brain than were elderly controls (N = 44). Controlling for the effects of age and gender, demented patients were distinguishable from controls by an increased prevalence of cortical atrophy and infarction, while depressed patients exhibited an increased prevalence of cortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy. Patients with dementia were distinguishable from those with major depression by an increased prevalence of cortical atrophy. These results indicate that major depression in late life, like dementia, is associated with a remarkable increase in overt pathologic changes in the brain. 
1	Lung cancer risk associated with cancer in relatives. Family history data from an incident case-control study of lung cancer conducted in the Texas Gulf Coast region between 1976 and 1980 were analyzed to evaluate the contribution of cancer in first-degree relatives to lung cancer risk. Odds ratios (OR) increased slightly as the number of relatives with any cancer increased (reaching 1.5 with 4 or more relatives with cancer). Risks were higher for tobacco-related cancers (OR = 1.5 for 2 or more relatives with these tumors) and greatest for first-degree relatives with lung cancer (OR = 2.8 for lung cancer in 2 or more relatives). For cases of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung, risks with 3 or more relatives with any cancer were increased 2-fold (OR = 1.8 and 1.9 respectively), and a significantly elevated risk was found for having a first-degree relative with lung cancer for each histologic type (ORs from 1.7-2.1). Having a spouse with lung cancer increased lung cancer risk (OR = 2.5), and cases with lung cancer reported in a first-degree relative were diagnosed at an earlier age, as were case siblings with lung cancer. 
2	Functional comparison between double and triple ileal loop pouches. Ileal pouch function in 35 patients operated upon by the same surgeon were compared. Seventeen of the patients had a double loop (J) ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and 18 a triple loop (S) pouch. The patients were examined a mean of 27.9 months and 5.1 months, respectively, after ileostomy closure. Ten of the S-pouch patients were evaluated more than 6 months (S greater than 6 months), mean 9.1 after ileostomy closure. There were no differences in the mean maximum resting pressures or maximum squeeze pressures between the groups. The incidence of daytime and nocturnal leakage was lower in the S-pouch group, 22 and 29 percent, than in the J group 29, and 53 percent. Though the mean maximum tolerated volume (MTV) of the S-pouch group was greater than the J group, the difference was not statistically significant. The difference in the mean compliance between the J- and S-pouch groups and the J and S greater than 6 months group was statistically significant (P less than 0.01) and (P less than 0.008). All the patients could evacuate spontaneously. The difference in the 24-hour frequency of defecation between the S greater than 6 months and J group was significant (P less than 0.05), but not between the S and J groups. The median frequency of nocturnal defecation between the S greater than 6 months and J pouch groups was significant (P less than 0.005), but not between the S and J groups. The triple loop S-pouches were more compliant than the J-pouches and had a better functional result as shown by a lower incidence of nocturnal leakage, and a lower frequency of defecation during the day and night. 
2	The role of bacteria in pigment gallstone disease. One hundred ten of nine hundred sixty consecutive patients who underwent surgery for gallstones (GS) had pigment stones (PS) (11.45%). Fifty brown PSs contained calcium bilirubinate, small amounts of cholesterol, and always calcium palmitate, were usually found in the common duct (96%), and were almost always associated with bile infection (98%) and diffuse erosion of the biliary mucosa. Fifty-one black PSs contained bilirubin polymers, calcium carbonate, and/or phosphate, seldom cholesterol, and never evident amounts of calcium palmitate, were mostly found in the gallbladder, and were associated with hemolysis or liver damage and with hyperplastic cholecystosis. Bile infection was found in 19.6% of cases, but bacteria were never found in the center of black PSs by scanning electron microscopy. Nine additional patients (8.2% of PSs, 0.9% of GSs) had concomitant black and brown PSs that were mostly found in the common duct and were always associated with bile infection. It is suggested that, even if PSs with concomitant black and brown material can be found, black and brown PSs greatly differ not only in pathogenesis but also in clinical behavior and treatment. In particular bacterial infection is important only in the pathogenesis of brown PSs while it plays no role in the initial formation of cholesterol, mixed or black GSs. 
5	Pulmonary malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Presentation with fever and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A 64-year-old man presented with protracted fever, hyponatremia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was established. The absence of pulmonary infiltrates precluded any lung biopsy. Autopsy revealed malignant angioendotheliomatosis involving multiple organs including the alveolar septa and pulmonary vasculature. An early diagnosis of MAE in the setting of fever and SIADH may be possible via transbronchial biopsy. 
2	Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis. Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses. We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer. Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal. Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment. Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described. 
4	An overview of randomized trials of sodium reduction and blood pressure To test for effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and to provide precise estimates of their magnitude, we conducted an overview of randomized clinical trials that aimed to reduce the intake of sodium in human subjects. We excluded from pooled analyses trials with confounded designs, those that compared intake levels beyond the usual range in the population, and those without published reports. Two reviewers abstracted information in duplicate and differences were reconciled. Twenty-three trials with outcome data from an aggregate of 1,536 subjects were included. Data were pooled both separately for hypertensive and normotensive subjects and for all trials combined. With the use of sample size weighting, blood pressure reductions (net of controls) were 4.9 +/- 1.3/2.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic, respectively, with 95% confidence limits) in hypertensive subjects and 1.7 +/- 1.0/1.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in normotensive subjects. The combined blood pressure reductions were 2.9 +/- 0.8/1.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg. These changes were associated with mean reduction of urinary sodium excretion ranging from 16 to 171 mmol/24 hr for individual trials. A dose-response relation across trials was found, both in normotensive and in hypertensive subjects. These results indicate that sodium reduction lowers mean blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals for periods of at least several months. The findings are highly consistent with results of observational epidemiological studies and have implications for preventive strategies of blood pressure control. 
5	The effect of cesarean delivery on birth outcome in very low birth weight infants. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. To determine whether cesarean delivery is associated with a better outcome than vaginal delivery for infants weighing less than 1500 g (very low birth weight), we examined neonatal mortality and the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 1765 very low birth weight inborn infants admitted to seven neonatal intensive care centers. The cesarean rate was 32.5% for infants weighing 501-750 g and 52.4% for infants weighing 751-1000 g. The neonatal death rate was 53.1% for infants weighing 501-750 g delivered by cesarean, compared with 64.3% for vaginally born infants (P = .046). However, for infants weighing 1001-1250 g, the neonatal death rate for infants delivered by cesarean was 14.4%, compared with 7.8% for infants born vaginally (P = .02). The incidence of IVH was significantly lower in infants born by cesarean than in those born vaginally only in the 1251-1500-g birth weight interval (11.8 versus 18.9%; P = .03). Compared with women delivering vaginally, those delivered by cesarean were more likely to attain a higher mean gestation, to have preeclampsia, and to have a breech presentation, and less likely to be in labor. After adjusting by logistic regression for gestational age, preeclampsia, breech presentation, presence or absence of labor, and for center effects, the odds ratio for neonatal death was 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.71-1.41); for IVH, the odds ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.61-1.19). These data suggest that after accounting for certain maternal and fetal factors, cesarean delivery is not associated with a lower risk of either mortality or IVH. 
5	Factors associated with soft- and hard-tissue compromise of endosseous implants. This prospective analysis identifies factors associated with endosseous implant removal as well as factors associated with implant morbidity resulting in nonscheduled patient visits. Treatment of the latter conditions is discussed. The most important factors identified for implant success were surgery without compromise in technique, placing implants into sound bone, avoiding thin bone or implant dehiscence at the time of implant placement, avoiding premature implant exposure during the healing period, establishing a balanced restoration, and insuring appropriate follow-up hygiene care. In the posterior mandible, the presence of keratinized gingiva was strongly correlated with optimal soft- and hard-tissue health. 
2	High cholestanol and low campesterol-to-sitosterol ratio in serum of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis before liver transplantation. Serum levels of cholesterol precursors (squalene, delta 8-cholestanol, desmosterol and lathosterol), plant sterols (campesterol and sitosterol), cholestanol and cholestanol/noncholesterol sterol ratios were related to liver damage and liver transplantation indications in healthy controls (n = 26) and in 31 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis divided into group I (S-bilirubin less than 21 mumol/L; n = 14), group II (S-bilirubin 21 to 108 mumol/L; n = 7) and group III (elected for liver transplantation; S-bilirubin 109 to 520 mumol/L; n = 10). The mean serum respective lathosterol levels in controls and in group I were three and two times higher than those in groups II and III, respectively. The plant sterol contents were higher in group II than in groups I and III and the campesterol/sitosterol ratios were lowest in group III. The serum cholestanol levels were high even in group I (i.e., in patients without icterus) and increased progressively to group III, up to 6 and 13 times those in group I and the control group, respectively. The cholestanol/noncholesterol sterol ratios increased progressively from the controls to groups I, II and III. The serum cholestanol levels were positively related to serum bilirubin levels in all primary biliary cirrhosis patients (n = 31, r = 0.906) and to the plant sterol levels in the control group and group I, but significantly negatively in group III. The cholestanol vs. precursor sterol correlations were negative in most cases. 
5	Retinopathy of prematurity in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease. We undertook a study of premature infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease to determine whether these infants develop retinopathy of prematurity despite a persistent hypoxemic state. Using the computerized registry of the neonatal intensive care unit of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn, we identified six premature infants (less than 37 weeks' gestational age, with birth weights of 1100 to 2050 g) with cyanotic congenital heart disease who survived the neonatal period and underwent ophthalmologic evaluation. Review of their charts revealed that three of six infants developed retinopathy of prematurity (two had grade 1 and one had grade 3 disease), but none required treatment. Our data support the findings of other investigators that elevated arterial oxygen tension is not the sole factor leading to the development of retinopathy of prematurity. Premature infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease can develop retinopathy of prematurity despite persistent hypoxemia. Cyanotic premature infants should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity with the same thoroughness as other premature infants. 
4	Pancreatic ischaemia in experimental acute pancreatitis: mechanism, significance and therapy. Much clinical and experimental evidence suggests that pancreatic ischaemia in the early phase of acute pancreatitis is important in the development of pancreatic necrosis. While depletion of intravascular volume has often been assumed to be the main circulatory defect, an additional disturbance of pancreatic microcirculation has been demonstrated experimentally. Possible contributory mechanisms include chemical-induced vasoconstriction, direct injury of vessel wall, intravascular coagulation and increased endothelial permeability resulting in pancreatic oedema, haemoconcentration and impaired venous drainage. Pancreatic ischaemia as a consequence of these local effects seems to be responsible for the transition of mild pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis. In experimental models the beneficial effect of various drugs and of sympathetic blockade has been ascribed to an improvement in pancreatic perfusion. Although effective volume therapy is generally accepted as the mainstay of conservative treatment in acute pancreatitis, the efficacy of different fluid preparations is still controversial, and simple fluid resuscitation has not been shown to prevent the development of parenchymal necrosis. The specific impairment of pancreatic microcirculation cannot be prevented merely by replenishment of intravascular volume with crystalloids, albumin or plasma despite normalization of macrohaemodynamics. In contrast, partial replacement of blood by dextran preparations has been shown to increase pancreatic perfusion by improving blood fluidity. Isovolaemic haemodilution in conjunction with conventional fluid therapy may provide a new and effective means of protecting the pancreas from secondary injury due to the early ischaemic phase of acute pancreatitis. 
2	Imidazole salicylate versus piroxicam in the treatment of arthrosis in elderly patients. A double-blind clinical and endoscopic trial. The clinical efficacy and gastroduodenal tolerability of imidazole salicylate (imidazole 2-hydroxybenzoate, ITF 182), a new synthetic drug with an anti-inflammatory action, was evaluated endoscopically in comparison with those of piroxicam in elderly patients suffering from osteoarthrosis. Of the 41 patients entering the trial, only 38 completed the protocol (6 men and 32 women; mean age, 71; range, 65-80 years). After upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the purpose of excluding gastric and duodenal mucosal lesions, the patients were allocated at random, according to a double-blind, double-dummy protocol, to treatment either with imidazole salicylate 750 mg three times daily or with piroxicam 20 mg once daily for a period of 4 weeks. Imidazole salicylate proved active in controlling a number of the pain symptoms caused by arthrosis, although its efficacy was inferior to that of piroxicam. Grade 2 gastric mucosal lesions were detected in 1 of 20 patients (5%) treated with imidazole salicylate; lesions corresponding to grades 2, 3, and 4 were found in 6 of 18 (33%) of those treated with piroxicam (P = .034). Painful dyspepsia was reported by 15% of the patients in the imidazole salicylate group and by 28% of those in the piroxicam group. On the basis of these results and under the experimental conditions adopted in this trial, the authors concluded that imidazole salicylate is characterized by good gastric tolerability and can thus be used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in the elderly. 
5	Right pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. Serial assessment of pulmonary artery flow by Doppler echocardiography was carried out in 15 infants after pulmonary artery banding. Three infants were identified as having branch pulmonary artery obstruction based on diastolic pulmonary artery flow. It is concluded that this flow profile may be specific for branch pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. 
2	Successful hyperlipemic pregnancy. Women with hypertriglyceridemia are prone to gestational pancreatitis, a condition carrying substantial maternal and fetal risk. We describe a 33-year-old woman with familial hypertriglyceridemia who had recurrent hyperlipidemic abdominal crises during previous pregnancies despite dietary fat restrictions. A fifth pregnancy was carried to term without complications after aggressive dietary therapy and intermittent intravenous feeding, administered whenever her triglyceride levels exceeded an arbitrarily selected threshold concentration of 28 mmol/L. The efficacy of this approach may be explained by the published observation that low-fat (high-carbohydrate) isocaloric diets elevate serum triglyceride levels by the oral, but not the intravenous, route in normal individuals. Reduction of this patient's serum triglyceride concentrations by interrupting oral intake and administering intravenous glucose appeared to prevent late-pregnancy pancreatitis and culminated in uncomplicated full-term delivery. 
5	Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with active multiple sclerosis. The level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was quantitated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 patients with other neurological disorders in whom immunological mechanisms are unlikely to participate. The sIL-2R level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis in relapse was significantly higher compared with patients with multiple sclerosis in remission and with controls. The sIL-2R level, especially in the cerebrospinal fluid, showed higher sensitivity and specificity than other clinical parameters including the cerebrospinal fluid IgG ratio, peripheral lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio, cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein and oligoclonal bands. Our data suggest that measurement of the sIL-2R level may be useful in evaluating disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis. 
2	Gastrointestinal pathology in adult iron overdose. The gastrointestinal effects of iron overdose have been described in children. They may occur acutely, ranging in severity from mucosal injury to complete infarction, or several weeks later, as obstruction due to stricture formation. They typically occur in the stomach or proximal small bowel. We describe an adult example of both, each occurring in the distal portion of the small intestine. Both patients had ingested enteric-coated iron preparations and both experienced significant, protracted abdominal pain. Thus adults as well as children are at risk for severe gastrointestinal complications after iron overdose. Significant protracted abdominal pain should alert the clinician of its possibility. Damage to distal areas of the bowel can occur with complete sparing of proximal portions particularly if the iron is an enteric-coated preparation. 
5	Ten years of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: neurodevelopmental outcome. Cf the 87 survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over a 10-year period, 67 participated in a follow-up study which included neurologic examination (n = 67), cognitive testing (n = 67), and audiologic assessment (n = 33). Matched control subjects for those older than 5 years were also evaluated. Outcome was defined as normal for cognitive scores greater than or equal to 85 and normal neurologic examination results, suspect for cognitive scores 70 through 84 or nonfocal neurologic findings such as hypertonia/hypotonia, and abnormal for cognitive scores less than 70 or abnormal neurologic examination results. Of the 10 school-aged children studied, 9 were normal and there were no differences in mean cognitive scores between subjects and controls (IQ subjects = 109 +/- 12 [SD], IQ controls = 107 +/- 13). For preschoolers aged 2.7 through 4.11 years, the mean cognitive score was 91 +/- 11 and 7 (70%) were normal. For infants 6 through 30 months, the mean cognitive score was 101 +/- 22 and 27 (57%) were normal. A total of 7 children (21% of those studied) had abnormal audiologic assessments. Three children demonstrated mild high-frequency and 4 moderately severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss which was bilateral in 3 and of undetermined laterality in 1. Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was significantly associated with cerebral infarction and chronic lung disease. Outcome was not related to demographic or perinatal variables, illness severity prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or underlying diagnosis. Neurodevelopmental outcome among survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this series is consistent with previous reports of morbidity among neonates with severe respiratory failure treated conventionally. 
1	Hematoporphyrin photodynamic therapy: is there truly a future in head and neck oncology? Reflections on a 5-year experience. Photodynamic therapy, which consists of the selective destruction of tumors using a combination of a photosensitizer administered systemically (dihematoporphyrin ether) and an argon dye-pumped laser, has provoked profound interest amongst oncologists and has particularly titillated head and neck oncologists with its potential. Unfortunately, no multi-institutional trials for head and neck tumors have been introduced, and the literature is replete with anecdotal reports from individual researchers on the management of advanced cancers for palliation, superficial early cancers, and field cancerization of the mucosa ("condemned mucosa"). A personal 5-year experience with 41 head and neck cancers was reviewed, as was the current literature. An attempt was made to place in perspective the true role and future direction of this technology. 
5	Caesarean section in a patient with haemoglobin SC disease and a phaeochromocytoma. The anaesthetic management of a patient with haemoglobin SC disease for lower segment Caesarean section and excision of a phaeochromocytoma is described. The patient was given a general anaesthetic for the surgical procedure after exchange transfusion had achieved an haemoglobin A concentration of greater than 50%. A live infant was delivered and a suprarenal phaeochromocytoma was excised during a 6.5 hour procedure. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. 
1	Preoperative radiotherapy in operable rectal cancer. The effect of preoperative radiotherapy (31.5 Gy in 3.5 weeks) in operable rectal cancer was examined with respect to resectability and prognosis after two surgical procedures, abdominoperineal resection, or low anterior resection. Preoperative radiation did not influence the surgeon's selection of low anterior resection, which was similar (40 percent) in each group. Radiation improved five-year survival probability and decreased the incidence of local recurrence significantly after low anterior resection. In contrast, no improvement of treatment results was found in patients treated by abdominoperineal resection after radiotherapy. 
5	Unfavorable outcome following early surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms--a critical review of 238 patients. Among 238 consecutive patients admitted early with ruptured cerebral aneurysms, surgical repair within 48-72 hours was feasible in 200 cases. Unfavorable outcomes among the latter 200 patients are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Preoperatively, 148 patients were in Hunt and Hess grades I-III, 33 were in grade IV, and 19 in grade V. After clipping of the aneurysm, all patients received a regimen of topical intracisternal and intravenous/peroral medication with the calcium antagonist nimodipine. The overall rate of unfavorable outcomes was 25%, ie, outcome with moderate or severe deficit or lethal outcome. The reasons for unfavorable outcomes among these 49 patients were the devastating effect of the bleed (severe subarachnoid hemorrhage or additional intracerebral hemorrhage) in 31 patients (15% of the 200 patients), a surgical complication in 11 (5.5%), preoperative rebleeding in three (1.5%), delayed ischemia from vasospasm in one (0.5%), and various others in three further patients (1.5%). Unfavorable outcome occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative grades I-III, in 52% of patients with grade IV, and in 16 of 19 patients with grade V. Among the 141 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage but not intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, 16 made an unfavorable outcome, ie, 11% versus 56% among patients with intracerebral hematoma/intraventricular hematoma on preoperative computed tomography scan. The present data seem to speak in favor of early surgery. Since half of the patients with intracerebral hematoma and poor outcome had suffered previous warning leaks, it appears to be a continuing challenge to diagnose warning leaks before a massive hemorrhage occurs. 
4	A controlled clinical trial to assess the effect of a calcium channel blocker on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis To determine whether calcium channel blockers influence the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, 383 patients age 65 years or less with 5-75% stenoses in at least four coronary artery segments were selected at random within 1 month of coronary arteriography to participate in double-blind therapy with a placebo or nicardipine 30 mg three times daily. Coronary events (5 deaths, 22 myocardial infarctions, and 28 unstable anginas) occurred in 28 of 192 nicardipine patients and 23 of 191 placebo patients (p = NS). At 24 months coronary arteriography was repeated in 335 patients. Progression, defined as a 10% or more worsening in diameter stenosis, measured quantitatively, was found in 147 of 1,153 lesions (12.7%) in 168 nicardipine patients and in 170 of 1,170 lesions (14.5%) in 167 placebo patients (p = NS). Ninety-two nicardipine patients (55%) and 95 placebo patients (57%) had progression at one or more sites (p = NS). Regression, that is, an improvement by 10% or more in diameter stenosis, was seen in 140 of 2,323 lesions (6.0%) overall, with no significant intergroup difference. Among the 217 patients with 411 stenoses of 20% or less in the first study, such minimal lesions progressed in only 15 of 99 nicardipine patients compared with 32 of 118 placebo patients (15% versus 27%, p = 0.046). In this subgroup, 16 of 178 minimal lesions in nicardipine patients and 38 of 233 minimal lesions in placebo patients progressed (p = 0.038). By stepwise logistic-regression analysis, baseline systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04) and the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months (p = 0.002) correlated with progression of minimal lesions. This suggested blood pressure reduction may account for the beneficial action of nicardipine. These results suggested nicardipine has no effect on advanced coronary atherosclerosis but may retard the progression of minimal lesions. 
3	Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the "eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis. 
1	Cold-knife and laser conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. In a 5-year study, 425 women had conization performed for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II or III. Conization was performed only in cases of positive endocervical curettage or when colposcopy was inconclusive. In all other cases, local destruction was the operation of choice. In the early years of the study, conization was done by the cold-knife method (N = 201), whereas CO2 laser was used in the latter part of the study (N = 224). Success and complication rates were the same for the two methods. Abnormal cytology after conization was found in a total of 53 cases (12.5%), but a histologic confirmation of residual or recurrent CIN was made in only 27 women (6.4%). This corresponds to a success rate of 92% after cold-knife and 95% after laser conization. The CIN grading of the residual or recurrent CIN was similar to or less than the CIN diagnosis of the cone. Because our success rate was comparable to that of other series with much less strict referral criteria, our policy seems adequate. 
5	A case of severe pancytopenia caused by ibuprofen. We here present the case of a patient with severe neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia associated with long-term use of ibuprofen. The blood parameters rapidly normalized when the drug was discontinued, and no further treatment, except for a short course of antibiotics, was required. 
1	Risk for colon adenomas in patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hyperplastic polyps found in the rectosigmoid area of the colon are associated with proximal adenomas, and to judge whether patients with distal hyperplastic polyps found during sigmoidoscopy might benefit from full colonoscopy. DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas. 
3	Acute rheumatic fever in West Virginia. Not just a disease of children. Rheumatic fever is a poststreptococcal disease that is receiving renewed attention by the medical community. We describe a recent increase in the number of observed cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in West Virginia. This is the fifth report of a recent increase in the incidence of ARF in the Ohio Valley area in the last 4 years. In contrast to the other reports, nearly two thirds of our cases of ARF were in adults, more than half of whom had suffered previous bouts of ARF. In these adults with recurrences, none was taking prophylactic penicillin at the time of presentation. Carditis was present in seven adults, two without a history of carditis. Arthritis was present in all adult patients. These data indicate a possible geographic phenomenon related to the increased number of observed cases of ARF and document that ARF is not simply a disease of childhood. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for extended penicillin prophylaxis for secondary prevention of ARF, especially for those with an increased risk of acquiring a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection. 
5	Urothelial grafts in mice. Mouse bladder epithelium has been successfully transplanted to the bladders of syngeneic mice and has survived for at least twenty weeks. The fate of the transplanted tissue was followed using a fluorescein label. The recipient bladders were prepared by stripping the urothelium either by a surgical or a chemical method. The possibility of adopting a comparable technique for the treatment of early bladder cancer in man is discussed. 
5	Hemoglobin Montreal: a new variant with an extended beta chain due to a deletion of Asp, Gly, Leu at positions 73, 74, and 75, and an insertion of Ala, Arg, Cys, Gln at the same location. The unstable hemoglobin Montreal with a deletion of three amino acid residues (Asp, Gly, Leu) at positions 73, 74, and 75 of the beta chain and an insertion of four residues (Ala, Arg, Cys, Gln) at the same location was observed in a 7-year-old Canadian boy suffering from a moderate hemolytic anemia. The introduction of an extra amino acid residue and of other changes in the crevice where the heme group is located is the likely cause of the instability of this hemoglobin variant. The above listed changes were detected through analyses of tryptic peptides of the beta-Montreal chain, sequencing of amplified DNA, and hybridization of amplified DNA with appropriate, 32P-labeled, oligonucleotide probes. It is suggested that a mispairing involving the AGTG sequences at codons 66 and 67 and at codons 72 and 73 of the normal beta gene caused a repetition of a 16-bp segment, while a deletion of 10 nucleotides due to recombination or slippage followed by a second short deletion during DNA repair resulted in the modified sequence of the beta-Montreal gene. 
5	The Children's Orientation and Amnesia Test: relationship to severity of acute head injury and to recovery of memory. The Children's Orientation and Amnesia Test (COAT) was developed to assess cognition serially during the early stage of recovery from traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents. The norms for the COAT, which is composed of 16 items evaluating general orientation, temporal orientation, and memory, were defined from data obtained from 146 children aged 3 to 15 years. In 37 patients with head injuries, the duration of posttraumatic amnesia, as indicated by the number of days COAT scores were in the impaired range, was significantly related to both verbal and nonverbal memory at the baseline and 6 and 12 months after injury. COAT scores were a better predictor of verbal and nonverbal memory performance than the Glasgow Coma Scale score at 6 and 12 months after the injury. This study shows that the COAT has adequate reliability and validity as a measure of the duration of posttraumatic amnesia in children and adolescents. 
4	Proton magnetic resonance of exercise-induced water changes in gastrocnemius muscle. Exercise-induced water concentration changes have been determined in the medial gastrocnemius muscle noninvasively with image-guided in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). These measurements were performed on seven normal male volunteers during and after isometric and ischemic-isometric exercise at 5, 10, and 20% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The observed water flux changes during different phases of exercise have been interpreted in terms of fluid transfer between the vasculature and exercising muscle. Good correlation between individual MVC and changes in water fluxes and the decay of water content was observed after 20% MVC exercise level. MRS results have been found to be consistent with those reported in the literature based on invasive biopsy techniques. 
5	Biologically inert synthetic dural substitutes. Appraisal of a medical-grade aliphatic polyurethane and a polysiloxane-carbonate block copolymer. Two types of artificial membranes, a medical-grade aliphatic polyurethane and a polysiloxane-carbonate block copolymer, were tested as substitutes for dura in 24 and 12 rabbits, respectively. The films were placed either epidurally, subdurally, or as dural grafts in equal subgroups of animals. The postoperative course was uneventful with no manifestations of convulsive disorder or cerebrospinal fluid leak. The animals were sacrificed 3, 6, or 9 months after implantation of the artificial membranes. Both types of artificial membranes were easily removed from the underlying nervous and the other surrounding tissues. The histological examination failed to reveal adhesions, neomembrane formations, or any type of foreign body reactions to the polyurethane film. The implantation of the polysiloxane-carbonate film caused no reaction when it was applied epidurally. As a dural graft, the polysiloxane-carbonate copolymer induced the formation of a thin neomembrane of one to two layers of fibroblasts which formed a watertight seal of the dural defect. A similar thin neomembrane was found to encase this artificial membrane in the group of animals in which it was implanted subdurally. There was no foreign body reaction to the polysiloxane-carbonate film. The authors conclude that these materials hold promise as dural substitutes or in the prevention of spinal dural scarring, and should be evaluated clinically. 
5	Traffic of peripheral B and T lymphocytes to hyperplastic, preneoplastic thymuses of AKR mice. AKR mice develop hyperplasia of the thymus before the development of retrovirus-associated lymphoma at that site. This hyperplasia, first detectable in AKR/J mice by 4 weeks of age and in AKR/C mice by 4 to 5 months of age, is characterized by an enlarged thymic medulla that contains T and B lymphocytes. In contrast to the general population of thymocytes, most of these T and B lymphocytes have a mature immunophenotype that includes expression of high levels of the MEL-14-defined (gp90) 'homing receptor' for peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules. In vivo homing studies reveal a marked increase in traffic of peripheral lymphocytes (T more than B) to the hyperplastic thymuses of old AKR mice as compared to histologically normal thymuses of age-matched BALB/c and C57BL/Ka mice or young AKR mice. These changes correlate chronologically with changes in retrovirus antigen expression in AKR thymuses and suggest a role for the traffic of lymphocytes from the periphery to the thymus in response to local antigenic stimulation in the pathogenesis of thymic hyperplasia in AKR mice. 
5	Effects of prostaglandin E1 in postoperative surgical patients with circulatory deficiency. Hemodynamic and oxygen transport effects of PGE1 were observed in the early postoperative period before development of ARDS in two series of general surgical patients with circulatory deficiencies. The first was a series of 19 studies in 18 patients, the second was a placebo-controlled series of 20 patients (ten received PGE1 and ten received a placebo). In the first series, PGE1 was given as a trial of therapy after fluid therapy to pulmonary wedge pressures greater than 15 mm Hg failed to correct satisfactorily circulatory and metabolic functions. There were two deaths in the placebo group and none in the PGE1 group. Previous studies indicated that PGE1 disaggregates platelets and reduces local vasoconstriction in pulmonary circulation; this study suggests that PGE1 improves tissue perfusion of systemic circulation. After fluid therapy to PAOP greater than 15 mm Hg fails to restore circulatory function to optimal values. PGE1 should be considered as ancillary therapy in critically ill postoperative patients. 
1	Malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction managed by subtotal/total colectomy. Of 60 patients presenting with acute obstructing carcinoma of the left colon, 49 underwent immediate resection either by radical subtotal/total colectomy (31 patients, group I) or by radical segmental resection (18 patients, group II) of whom three had immediate anastomosis after on-table bowel irrigation and 15 had a planned staged procedure. The operative mortality rate was 3 per cent in group I and 11 per cent in group II (not a statistically significant difference). However, substantial differences were found for major morbidity (6 versus 44 per cent in groups I and II respectively; P less than 0.01) and mean length of hospital stay (17 days in group I versus 35 days in group II; P less than 0.05). All three patients who had on-table lavage developed anastomotic leaks which necessitated a second operation to form a stoma. Six patients (19 per cent) in group I required antidiarrhoeal medication in the immediate postoperative period. However, subsequent improvement in stool frequency was noted in all patients. It is concluded that subtotal/total colectomy is an acceptable means of managing patients with obstructing carcinoma of the left colon in that it is associated with a low morbidity and mortality rate and good functional results. 
3	Decline in the prevalence of childhood deafness in the Jewish population of Jerusalem: ethnic and genetic aspects. A longitudinal study was performed on 147 Jewish children with bilaterally sensorineural hearing loss of moderately severe to profound degree, born in Jerusalem during the eighteen years 1968-85. The prevalence rate of these children declined during the years 1977-85, and at the same time the rate of consanguinity of their parents decreased; this decline was more evident in the genetic group among children with non-Ashkenazi ethnic origin. No such decline was found among the Ashkenazi children and no consanguinity among parents of these children was recorded. Our study supports the assumption that restriction of consanguineous matings may affect the prevalence of genetic deafness in children in a well-defined population. We have tried to remain unbiased and concede certain shortcomings in our present study. 
5	Deleterious effects of criminal victimization on women's health and medical utilization. The long-term consequences of criminal victimization on physical health were examined among 390 adult women (74 nonvictims and 316 victims of crime). Data included health status self-ratings and objective service utilization. Findings indicated that severely victimized women, compared with nonvictims, reported more distress and less well-being, made physician visits twice as frequently in the index year, and had outpatient costs that were 2.5 times greater. Criminal victimization severity was the most powerful predictor of physician visits and outpatient costs. Utilization data across 5 years preceding and following crime were obtained from 15 rape victims, 26 physical assault victims, and 27 noncontact crime victims and were compared with five continuous years of utilization among 26 nonvictims. Victims' physician visits increased 15% to 24% during the year of the crime compared with less than 2% change among nonvictims. We conclude that these long-term deleterious effects suggest that criminally victimized women's needs for medical treatment transcend the traditional focus on emergency care and forensic evaluation. 
5	Acetylsalicylic acid vs. metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis--a double-blind cross-over study. In a double blind cross-over study, 28 patients, 5 male and 23 female, aged 31 +/- 14 years, after a run-in period of 8 weeks, were treated for 3 months with acetylsalicylic acid and for another 3 months with metoprolol, both in a prophylactic mode. Attack frequency was reduced significantly with both therapeutic regimens (ASA p less than 0.001, metoprolol p less than 0.00005). Reduction of attacks below 50% was seen with metoprolol in 14 cases, and with ASA in three cases. Even though ASA was of statistically significant efficacy in migraine prophylaxis, it clearly is not the drug of first choice in migraine prophylaxis. 
5	Familial predisposition for herniation of a lumbar disc in patients who are less than twenty-one years old. The parents of sixty-three patients who were less than twenty-one years old and who had operatively confirmed herniation of a lumbar disc were interviewed regarding a history of sever back pain, sciatica, and herniated disc, to determine whether aggregation of herniation of a lumbar disc occurs in families of patients in this young age-group. The parents of sixty-three additional patients who had a non-spinal orthopaedic diagnosis (control group) were matched for age and sex with the study group and were given the same interview. Of the patients who had herniation of a lumbar disc and were less than twenty-one years old, 32 per cent had a positive family history for that lesion compared with 7 per cent of the control group. The relative risk of development of herniation of a lumbar disc before the age of twenty-one years is estimated to be approximately five times greater in patients who have a positive family history. The results indicate a familial basis for herniation of a lumbar disc in patients who are less than twenty-one years old. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of experimental rat brain tumors: histopathological evaluation. Using RG-C6 glioma-transplanted rats, we studied precontrast and postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging, extravasation of Evans blue, and histology. In all rats, tumor was enhanced with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The necrotic portion in the tumor, however, was not enhanced. Hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were clearly visualized on both the precontrast and postcontrast images. Blood-brain barrier-disrupted areas stained with Evans blue and areas enhanced with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging were nearly consistent. It is suggested that the mechanism of brain tumor enhancement with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging is simply related to the degree of alteration of the blood-brain barrier. The Gd-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, even with low magnetic field, is useful for the evaluation of size, shape, and location of experimental rat brain tumors. 
5	Cardiac rhabdomyoma. Rare cause of fetal death. Two cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and fetal death associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma are reported. Case 1 presented with fetal supraventricular tachycardia, and cardiac rhabdomyoma was accurately diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. Autopsy revealed multiple rhabdomyomata involving the right atrial free wall, the sinoatrial node, and the left ventricle. The left circumflex coronary artery was extrinsically compressed by adjacent tumor tissue, causing left ventricular myocardial infarction. Case 2 had a unique, pedunculated, ball-like rhabdomyoma that almost totally occluded the mitral orifice. The causes of fetal death in patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma are analyzed and the possibility of fetal surgical management is proposed. 
5	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. One hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) versus placebo following successful intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis. No subjects were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent endometritis and there were no wound infections or recurrent fevers. Minor side effects were seen in 10% of those taking amoxicillin and 14% of those taking placebo. Compliance was fair; only 52% of those taking amoxicillin and 65% of those taking placebo completed therapy. The lack of infectious complications in this high-risk population suggests that oral antibiotic therapy is unnecessary after successful IV antibiotic therapy for endometritis. 
1	Ovarian neoplasms and the risk of adnexal torsion. Previous reports examining adnexal torsion suggested that benign ovarian neoplasms are more likely to undergo torsion than malignant ovarian neoplasms. To our knowledge, this clinical observation has not been quantified. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with ovarian neoplasms found at the time of surgery over a 10-year period. Benign ovarian neoplasms had a 12.9-fold increased risk of undergoing adnexal torsion when compared with malignant ovarian neoplasms (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 15.9). The histologic type of ovarian neoplasm does not appear to affect the rate of adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion rarely involves cancer. 
5	Effects of intravenous immunoglobulin on hemorrhage-induced alterations in plasma cell repertoires. Hemorrhage produces decreases in serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and alterations in the number and frequency of B cells producing antibodies against bacterial antigens. These abnormalities in immune response may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection after injury and hemorrhage. To examine the relationship between serum Ig levels and bacterial antigen-specific plasma cell numbers and frequencies after blood loss, we treated hemorrhaged mice with intravenous Ig (IVIG). Hemorrhaged mice given IVIG had increased total numbers of splenic plasma cells compared with normal or hemorrhaged, untreated mice. Immunization with the bacterial polysaccharide antigen levan immediately after hemorrhage resulted in approximately 60% fewer levan-specific splenic plasma cells than those seen in normal unhemorrhaged mice. Treatment of hemorrhaged mice with IVIG did not correct the decrease in levan-specific plasma cells. These results demonstrate that hemorrhage-induced alterations in the numbers and frequencies of bacterial antigen-specific B cells are not related to changes in serum Ig levels and cannot be corrected through administration of IVIG. 
4	Morphological findings contributing to a failed Fontan procedure. Twelve-year experience. A group of 37 patients (age range, 3 months to 29 years) who died after the modified Fontan procedure (within 2 months), representing 15% of the 245 patients undergoing this procedure from 1976 through 1988, was reviewed to determine the causes of death. The three morphological groups were 1) univentricular atrioventricular connection (n = 19), 2) tricuspid atresia (n = 9), and 3) other complex malformations (n = 9). Subaortic stenosis was present in 15 patients (40%) in this group compared with 31 of 208 early survivors (15%) (p = 0.008). Pulmonary artery banding, identified as a risk factor in our previous experience, was performed in 14 patients, nine of whom had subaortic stenosis. Nine palliative procedures for subaortic stenosis were performed in eight patients--before the Fontan procedure in three patients and concurrently with the Fontan procedure in five patients. Myocardial hypertrophy and signs of acute ischemic injury were common findings at autopsy (n = 25) and were particularly prominent in all patients with univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology associated with subaortic stenosis and previous pulmonary artery banding (n = 7). We conclude that the present majority of deaths occurring after the modified Fontan procedure are myocardial in nature and attributable to advanced myocardial hypertrophy that is potentiated by previous pulmonary artery banding and subaortic stenosis.
