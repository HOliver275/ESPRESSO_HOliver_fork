Ovarian carcinoma metastatic to the breast and axillary node. Breast cancer is a common primary malignancy in women. On rare occasion the breast is also the site of metastatic disease. This report describes the evaluation of breast and axillary masses in a patient with known ovarian cancer, including the radiographic evaluation and special immunohistochemical stains with CA-125. Flow cytometric determinations and hormonal receptor analysis on both the primary and metastatic tumors demonstrate similar biologic characteristics. Both tumor sites demonstrated positive CA-125 staining, aneuploid DNA populations, moderately positive estrogen receptor content, and negative progesterone receptors. The mammogram demonstrated a well-circumscribed lesion with several areas of microcalcifications. Blood-borne metastasis from the ovary to the breast can show a varied clinical picture that can be differentiated from that of a primary breast carcinoma. 
Review of the secondary injury theory of acute spinal cord trauma with emphasis on vascular mechanisms. In patients with spinal cord injury, the primary or mechanical trauma seldom causes total transection, even though the functional loss may be complete. In addition, biochemical and pathological changes in the cord may worsen after injury. To explain these phenomena, the concept of the secondary injury has evolved for which numerous pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated. This paper reviews the concept of secondary injury with special emphasis on vascular mechanisms. Evidence is presented to support the theory of secondary injury and the hypothesis that a key mechanism is posttraumatic ischemia with resultant infarction of the spinal cord. Evidence for the role of vascular mechanisms has been obtained from a variety of models of acute spinal cord injury in several species. Many different angiographic methods have been used for assessing microcirculation of the cord and for measuring spinal cord blood flow after trauma. With these techniques, the major systemic and local vascular effects of acute spinal cord injury have been identified and implicated in the etiology of secondary injury. The systemic effects of acute spinal cord injury include hypotension and reduced cardiac output. The local effects include loss of autoregulation in the injured segment of the spinal cord and a marked reduction of the microcirculation in both gray and white matter, especially in hemorrhagic regions and in adjacent zones. The microcirculatory loss extends for a considerable distance proximal and distal to the site of injury. Many studies have shown a dose-dependent reduction of spinal cord blood flow varying with the severity of injury, and a reduction of spinal cord blood flow which worsens with time after injury. The functional deficits due to acute spinal cord injury have been measured electrophysiologically with techniques such as motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and have been found proportional to the degree of posttraumatic ischemia. The histological effects include early hemorrhagic necrosis leading to major infarction at the injury site. These posttraumatic vascular effects can be treated. Systemic normotension can be restored with volume expansion or vasopressors, and spinal cord blood flow can be improved with dopamine, steroids, nimodipine, or volume expansion. The combination of nimodipine and volume expansion improves posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow and spinal cord function measured by evoked potentials. These results provide strong evidence that posttraumatic ischemia is an important secondary mechanism of injury, and that it can be counteracted. 
Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness. Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye. Established blindness is irreversible. We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision. 
Endoscopic diverticulotomy for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum. First described by Mosher in 1916, endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticulum has since been reported infrequently in the surgical literature and continues to engender controversy. Between 1978 and 1989, we treated 11 unselected patients surgically for pharyngoesophageal diverticula. Endoscopic diverticulotomy was used in 11 patients and an external approach was used in the others. The endoscopically treated patients had no serious complications, resumed oral intake early, and were discharged from the hospital earlier. Our review of the surgical literature confirmed our experience with the efficacy and safety of the procedure. We therefore recommend endoscopic diverticulotomy as being equal to external approaches with regard to effectiveness; and it affords the patient a shortened hospital stay and more rapid return to to the premorbid state. 
Results of treatment with high intensity, brief duration chemotherapy in poor prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A novel chemotherapeutic approach was designed for the treatment of intermediate and high-grade histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using augmented (but subtransplantation) doses of chemotherapy administered at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. For the initial evaluation of this regimen, poor prognosis patients were treated with a projected long-term survival rate of less than 25% in response to standard therapy. Between March 1982 and May 1988, 56 previously untreated patients were entered into this study; all patients had either high-grade histology (20 patients) or predominantly large cell lymphoma (36 patients). Median age was 41.5 years (range, 18 to 69 years). Poor prognosis features included: Stage IV, 71%; poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, 2 to 4), 55%; multiple extranodal sites of disease, 52%; elevated lactic dehydrogenase (greater than 300 IU/l), 43%; and bulky (greater than 10 cm) tumor masses, 30%. Thirty-three of 56 patients (59%) were in Shipp's Category 3. During the 6-year study, the chemotherapy regimen was modified in an attempt to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. However, most patients received a 2-month course of therapy as follows: cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, and 29; etoposide 400 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 and 100 mg/m2 on days 29, 30, 31; doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV on days 29, 30; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; bleomycin 10 units/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; methotrexate 200 mg/m2 IV on days 15 and 43 followed 24 hours later by leucovorin 15 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours for six doses; and prednisone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 7 and 29 to 35. The complete response (CR) rate was 77% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 86%). There were ten relapses, only one of which occurred after 18 months of follow-up. Overall event-free survival (EFS) was 52% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 68%), with a median follow-up of 36 months. Eleven of 13 patients with small noncleaved lymphoma had CR; actuarial EFS in this subgroup was 61%. Myelosuppression occurred in all patients, with severe leukopenia (less than 1000/microliters) lasting a median of 12 days (range, 3 to 29 days); toxic deaths occurred in five patients (9%; 95% confidence interval, 4% to 19%). This intensive approach improved the response and survival of very poor risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. 
Management options in fulminant hepatic failure. The diagnosis of FHF carries with it a high mortality rate. Though the early results of OLT for FHF are encouraging, some have called for caution as these results are in a select population and may be similar to the optimistic early reports of now-discredited therapies. However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%. Therefore, patients with FHF should be transferred at an early stage to an experienced liver unit where the option of liver transplantation can be considered. 
Total acromionectomy. A twenty-year review. Thirty-five patients (thirty-eight shoulders) were treated consecutively with a total acromionectomy between 1969 and 1989. At a minimum of two years (average, five years and eight months) after the operation, thirty-one patients (thirty-four shoulders) were available for review. The results, which were rated on the basis of pain, function, range of motion, strength, and the satisfaction of the patient, were excellent for twenty-five shoulders, good for four, fair for three, and poor for one. Four of the five least satisfactory results were in patients who had had a long-standing massive tear of the rotator cuff. This study was done to separate the criticism of the operative procedure of total acromionectomy from an avoidable complication of that procedure, retraction of the deltoid, and to describe the specific advantages and satisfactory results that occur when that complication is avoided. It is my opinion that failure to repair the deltoid adequately results in retraction of that muscle, and that this avoidable complication is responsible for the unfavorable reputation of total acromionectomy. 
Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic postmenopausal women by transvaginal sonography. From November 1987 to January 1991, 1300 postmenopausal women underwent screening with transvaginal sonography (TVS). Women eligible for screening were all asymptomatic with no known ovarian tumors. Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula, and a value in excess of 8.0 cm3 was considered abnormal. Ovarian abnormalities were detected in 33 women (2.5%), and 27 underwent exploratory laparotomy. Ovarian tumors were noted in all 27 patients, including 2 primary carcinomas and 14 serous cystadenomas. The two women with ovarian carcinomas had normal results of pelvic examinations and normal serum CA-125 levels. Both women had Stage I disease, and are alive and well after conventional therapy. TVS was time efficient, easy to perform, and well-accepted by patients. Currently, there are more than 3000 patient years of follow-up in the screened population, and there have been no deaths due to ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional trial to determine the efficacy of TVS as a screening method for ovarian cancer is indicated. 
Recent advances in MR imaging/spectroscopy of cerebral ischemia. Recent advances in high-resolution MR imaging and multinuclear spectroscopy have stimulated studies of the functional relationships between tissue hypoperfusion, cellular energy depletion, and brain edema associated with cerebral ischemia. The very slow (microns/sec) random translational motion of water protons in various brain tissues and intracranial fluid compartments can now be assessed with MR diffusion imaging. More slowly diffusing protons in ischemic tissues can be differentiated from normal parenchyma, CSF, and flowing blood, enabling the detection and localization of ischemic regions within minutes of the onset of stroke. Perfusion imaging "snapshots," obtained in as little as 25 msec with echoplanar MR methods, permit the evaluation of tissue washin/washout kinetics of contrast agents in the microvasculature, and thus the quantification of brain perfusion on a regional basis. Also, delineation of major intra- and extracranial arterial and venous structures with MR angiography, acquired with two- or three-dimensional Fourier transformation techniques, has enabled accurate noninvasive assessments of vascular occlusive disease. Finally, improvements in MR spectroscopic techniques have facilitated investigations of metabolic regulation and bioenergetics in experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia, as well as in stroke patients. Combined MR imaging and spectroscopy will likely play an important role in differentiating reversibly from irreversibly ischemic brain tissues and in the investigation of various neuroprotective pharmaceuticals. 
The mermaid malformation: cloacal exstrophy and occult spinal dysraphism. Five infants with cloacal exstrophy underwent neurological evaluation and radiographic examination of the caudal spine shortly after birth. Each was found to have occult spinal dysraphism. Four had terminal myelocystoceles, and one had a lipomyelomeningocele. Pathological anatomy was confirmed during surgery for the release of the tethered spinal cords. The striking association between cloacal exstrophy and occult spinal dysraphism suggests a common developmental defect in the caudal pole of the embryo. A hypothesis is offered to explain this association. Terminal myelocystocele and lipomyelomeningocele appear to be part of a continuum of lesions associated with skin-covered spina bifida. 
Enhancement of the protective qualities of gastric mucus by sucralfate: role of phosphoinositides. The effects of intragastric administration of sucralfate on the physicochemical properties of gastric mucus, and the mechanism of its protective action against alcohol-induced mucosal injury were investigated using in vivo and in vitro models. The experiments in vivo were conducted with groups of rats receiving a dose of 100 mg sucralfate twice daily for 5 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed 16 hours after the last dose, their stomachs dissected, and the mucosa subjected to physicochemical measurements. In the in vitro studies, gastric mucosa was cultured in the presence of sucralfate, ethanol, or both. The in vivo results revealed that sucralfate elicited an 8% increase in mucus gel dimension, while its sulfo- and sialomucin content increased by 63% and 81%, respectively. The changes in mucus gel mucin content with sucralfate were accompanied by a 9.5% increase in mucus hydrogen ion (H+) retardation capacity, 1.9-fold increase in viscosity, and a 60% increase in the gel hydrophobicity. The mucus elaborated in the presence of sucralfate exhibited 14% lower protein content and 62% higher content of carbohydrate than that of control, and contained more neutral lipids. Furthermore, the gastric mucus of the sucralfate group showed a marked increase in mucus glycoprotein polymeric form. The data obtained with gastric mucosal culture demonstrated that sucralfate elicited a significant increase in mucin synthesis, which was reflected in the enhanced metabolism of mucosal phosphoinositides. In contrast, ethanol, which exhibited detrimental effects on mucin synthesis, also caused alterations in the phosphoinositide signal pathway. The changes in mucin and phosphoinositide distribution patterns evoked by ethanol were prevented by sucralfate. Our results suggest that the mucosal strengthening action of sucralfate occurs through the stimulation of the metabolism of phosphoinositide-derived messenger molecules. 
The treatment of multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses: a case report. A Chinese female aged 2 years 8 months with tuberculous meningitis developed hydrocephalus requiring insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. After adequate anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy for 14 weeks, multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses developed. The lesions increased in size and number accompanied by clinical deterioration. Repeated drainage operations were performed in view of the increased intracranial pressure. The child made a remarkable recovery after an initial stormy course. 
An analysis of thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma. Pathophysiologic considerations and management recommendations. Thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma were reviewed. Clinical, imaging, and microscopic findings were integrated to develop a pathophysiologic construct and management guidelines. The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection. 
Clinical and pharmacokinetic basis for the antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media. Given the astonishing frequency in childhood of acute otitis media and its significant morbidity, such as hearing loss and possibly speech delay, improving treatment of response is essential. Since bacteria are an important cause of otitis media, antimicrobial treatment remains the cornerstone of such treatment. Over the last four decades, many clinical studies have shown that antibiotics can relieve symptoms and prevalent complications, although a universal cure is still elusive. This article summarizes the most pertinent clinical and experimental research on treating and preventing acute otitis media, with a focus on intervention trials and the pharmacokinetic behavior of antimicrobial drugs. 
Calcium-regulating hormones in hypertension: vascular actions. The vascular and potentially hypertensive actions of the calcium-regulating hormones 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol [1,25(OH)2D3], parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin and related factors such as parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are discussed. 1,25(OH)2D3 has inotropic and calciotropic actions on isolated vascular tissue whereas PTH is a vasodilator. PHF, which has been reported in plasma of humans with essential hypertension and spontaneously hypertensive rats, has both pressor and calciotropic actions. Calcitonin is without vascular effects and CGRP is a potent vasodilator. It is concluded that several of the hormones responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis modulate vascular Ca2+ metabolism and force generating capacity. These substances may be long-term modulators of vascular function and play a role in the determination of peripheral vascular resistance. 
Are vascular abnormalities a primary cause or secondary consequence of hypertension? This paper reviews the evidence that the resistance vasculature is altered in hypertension and the role that the vasculature may play in the pathogenesis of the disease. Although functional changes (i.e., increased vascular smooth muscle sensitivity) have been found to be associated with some models of hypertension (e.g., spontaneously hypertensive rat), in human essential hypertension it appears that the abnormalities that predominate in the resistance vasculature are structural in nature. These changes result in an increased media/lumen ratio of the more proximal resistance vessels (i.d. 100-300 microns), and the changes are such that they could account for many of the altered hemodynamic characteristics seen in patients with essential hypertension (e.g., increased minimum vascular resistance, increased pressor response). However, evidence that the abnormal structure of the peripheral vasculature is a prime determinant of blood pressure is still lacking, and much of the available evidence suggests that the altered structure is a secondary adaptation. Nevertheless, the abnormal vascular structure may play an important pathological role concerning the morbid consequences of the hypertensive disease, suggesting that normalization of vascular structure is a desirable aim for antihypertensive treatment. At present it seems that treatment must be continued for long periods, maybe many years, before vascular structure is normalized. 
The role of radiosurgery in the management of chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the cranial base. Despite conventional multimodality treatment (surgery and fractionated radiation therapy), recurrence and clinical progression of cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas are common. The malignant behavior of these tumors is a result of their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate. To explore the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of these skull base neoplasms, we assessed its use in four patients with chordoma and two with chondrosarcoma. In five of the patients, radiosurgery was used as adjuvant therapy for residual or recurrent tumors after surgical debulking, and in one patient with a chordoma, it was the primary treatment. No patient received fractionated external beam radiotherapy. All tumors were less than 30 mm in diameter and were treated with 20 Gy to the tumor margin. Skull base computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were essential to define the anatomic relationships between tumor and adjacent basal structures. During follow-up (mean, 22 mo; range, 8-36 mo), we found no progression of the treated tumor volume in any patient. Neurological deficits before treatment improved in three patients; the other three patients remained in stable neurological condition. Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated that two patients showed reduction in tumor size and four patients had no tumor growth. In one patient, a metastatic parietal lobe chondrosarcoma developed and was treated by microsurgery. Another patient showed tumor progression outside of the radiosurgical treatment volume. Our results attest to the value of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjuvant or primary treatment for selected patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma and demonstrate its potential advantages over standard fractionated irradiation. Analysis of the long-term clinical and imaging effects after radiosurgery is warranted. 
Mesenteric vascular anatomy at CT: normal and abnormal appearances. The appearance of the mesenteric vessels on computed tomographic scans was evaluated in 187 patients to determine the variations in the anatomic relationships between the mesenteric vessels in normal patients, in patients with malrotation, and in patients with abdominal masses. In 166 patients (88.8%), a portion of the cranial segment of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was anterior and to the right of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), although other normal configurations also occurred. A portion of the cranial segment of the SMV was directly anterior to the SMA in 15 patients (8.0%) and directly to the right of the SMA in 16 patients (8.6%). Of eight patients with complete inversion of the SMA and SMV, one had normal midgut rotation, two had malrotation, and six had neoplasms that displaced the vessels (one of these six also had malrotation). Of eight patients with inversion of only a part of the mesenteric vessels, none had malrotation. Although mesenteric inversion should stimulate a careful evaluation for malrotation, it is not pathognomonic of this condition. 
Suppression of gastric acid secretion by intravenous administration of famotidine in children. This study was designed to establish appropriate dosing requirements for intravenous use of famotidine, a new H2-receptor antagonist, in pediatric patients. Eighteen children, 2 to 69 months of age (mean +/- SD: 31 +/- 23 months), were treated with intravenously administered famotidine to prevent bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Continuous intragastric pH monitoring was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of various intravenous doses. An initial dose of 0.4 mg/kg was given and repeated only after the intragastric pH had dropped to less than 4.0 for 2 hours. Increased doses were given (0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mg/kg) if the previous dose did not raise the intragastric pH to greater than 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours. Sixteen patients achieved an intragastric pH greater than or equal to 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours, 13 with a dose of 0.4 mg/kg, and three with a dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The mean duration of continuous pH greater than 4.0 per dose was 9.0 +/- 7.5 hours. Ten patients received two or more intravenous doses of famotidine; the mean duration of pH greater than 4.0 after the second dose was less than that after the first (14.9 +/- 8.0 hours vs 6.9 +/- 3.2 hours, p less than 0.01). We conclude that intravenous famotidine therapy raises gastric pH to greater than 4.0 for approximately 9 hours in most children. Prolonged intravenous use of famotidine rapidly leads to a decreased duration of efficacy, necessitating intragastric pH monitoring to assess the effectiveness of treatment. 
Regional cerebral blood flow imaging: a quantitative comparison of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT with C15O2 PET. The aim of this study was to compare technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) imaging using positron emission tomography (PET). As investigation of dementia is likely to be one of the main uses of routine rCBF imaging, 18 demented patients were imaged with both techniques. The PET data were compared quantitatively with three versions of the SPECT data. These were, first, data normalized to the SPECT cerebellar uptake, second, data linearly corrected using the PET cerebellar value and, finally, data Lassen corrected for washout from the high flow areas. Both the linearly-corrected (r = 0.81) and the Lassen-corrected (r = 0.79) HMPAO SPECT data showed good correlation with the PET rCBF data. The relationship between the normalized HMPAO SPECT data and the PET data was nonlinear. It is not yet possible to obtain rCBF values in absolute units from HMPAO SPECT without knowledge of the true rCBF in one reference region for each patient. 
Seasonality in sudden infant death syndrome--United States, 1980-1987. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant less than 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a complete postmortem investigation, including autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the case history. SIDS, which usually occurs during sleep, is the leading cause of death in the postneonatal period (i.e., from 28 days through 364 days) and the eighth leading cause of years of potential life lost in the United States (1). The risk for SIDS is greatest for infants aged 1-4 months and during the cold season of the year (2); however, an independent contribution of the season of birth to the etiology of SIDS has not been consistently demonstrated (3). This report summarizes an assessment of the association between the risk for SIDS and an infant's month of birth, month of death, and age at death. 
Endocardial fibroelastosis in infants with hydrops fetalis. Endocardial fibroelastosis, defined as an endocardium in excess of 30 microns thick, was found in 10 out of 34 cases of hydrops fetalis in a review of 1589 perinatal necropsies carried out between 1976 and 1989. The infants comprised 16 cases of rhesus haemolytic disease, of whom three had endocardial fibroelastosis, and 18 cases of non-rhesus hydrops, of whom seven had endocardial fibroelastosis. Intrauterine congestive heart failure was thought to have been the probable cause of hydrops in eight of the 10 infants with endocardial fibroelastosis. None of an age matched control group without endocardial fibroelastosis had evidence of congestive cardiac failure. These observations support the hypothesis that endocardial fibroelastosis is an endocardial response to chronic prenatal myocardial stress. 
Colon perforation during colonoscopy: surgical versus conservative management. A survey of endoscopy units in the West Midlands, UK, was undertaken to ascertain the management of colonic perforation during colonoscopy. Fifteen perforations were reported from a total of 17,500 colonoscopies performed in 14 units (a rate of 0.09 per cent). In seven patients the diagnosis was suspected or diagnosed immediately and in the remaining eight 2-72 h later. Four patients with associated pathology (carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and a polyp) had resection and primary anastomosis. Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis. In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment. Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy. There was no significant morbidity following treatment. It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma. 
Health maintenance strategies for women of different ages. An overview. Preventive health strategies for screening for specific illnesses, counseling, and immunization are discussed. Emphasis is given to cardiovascular screening and risk reduction, screening for malignancies, and immunization practices. A framework for designing periodic health examinations for patients is detailed. 
Tumor antigen presentation by murine epidermal cells. The ability of epidermal Langerhans cells to present Ag for CD4-dependent immunity is well documented, and it has been hypothesized that Langerhans cells participate in the generation of immunity against incipient epidermal neoplasms by presentation of tumor-associated Ag in situ. This study examined the ability of murine epidermal cells (EC) to present tumor-associated Ag for the induction of in vivo antitumor immunity. Murine epidermal cells were deleted of Thy-1-bearing cells, cultured in 50 U/ml granulocyte-macrophage-CSF for 14 to 18 h, and pulsed with tumor fragments (TF) derived from S1509a-fibrosarcoma cells. These TF-pulsed EC were injected s.c. into syngeneic recipients at weekly intervals for a total of three immunizations and challenged with viable S1509a tumor cells 1 wk after the last immunization. Control animals received TF-pulsed allogeneic EC or EC treated identically but not pulsed with TF. EC that were pulsed with tumor cell fragments were able to induce protective immunity to tumor growth in vivo and to immunize for a significant delayed-type hypersensitivity response to injected tumor cells. The induction of antitumor immunity with TF-pulsed EC was genetically restricted, and culture of EC in granulocyte-macrophage-CSF was required for development of significant immunity. Furthermore, deletion of I-A+ cells by antibody and complement-mediated lysis eliminated the generation of immunity. Thus, I-A+ epidermal cells are capable of presenting S1509a tumor Ag for the generation of protective antitumor immunity in vivo. 
Evaluation of antiarrhythmic drug effects with simultaneous analysis of single ventricular premature contractions, couplets and salvos. To improve the clinical value of ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring as a tool of antiarrhythmic therapy control, a new statistical model was developed. In a patient group at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the spontaneous variability of ventricular arrhythmias was assessed, with simultaneous consideration of single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The study included 100 patients who suffered from coronary heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for whom greater than 30 ventricular premature complexes/h and couplets had been demonstrated on the last Holter ECG before the study. Between 3 and 12 Holter recordings were made for each patient in a drug-free state; the mean follow-up period was 260 days (maximum 1,403). The mean hourly values of the ectopic events (EE) were assessed separately for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos. The spontaneous variability (SV) was calculated for single ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos as SV = log (EEday 2 + 0.01/EEday 1 + 0.01) and linked in one, two and three dimensions. Compared with the consideration of only one type of arrhythmia (one-dimensional model), the simultaneous use of two or three types of arrhythmia (two- or three-dimensional model) resulted in considerably lower reduction and aggravation rates as sufficient proof of drug effects. With control intervals up to 1 week, the one-dimensional model yielded reduction rates for ventricular premature complexes, couplets and salvos of -63%, -90% and -95%, respectively. In contrast, with the three-dimensional model, the rates were -28%, -72% and -88%. The corresponding aggravation values were +370, +1,114% and +2,189% versus +38%, +256% and +747%. 
Impact of pretransplant conditioning and donor T cells on chimerism, graft-versus-host disease, graft-versus-leukemia reactivity, and tolerance after bone marrow transplantation. Graft rejection, mixed chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leukemia relapse, and tolerance are interrelated manifestations of immunologic reactivity between donor and host cells that significantly affect survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In this report, a mouse model of BMT, in which the donor and host were compatible at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), was used (1) to examine the interrelationship of pretransplant conditioning and T-cell content of donor BM with regard to lymphoid chimerism and GVHD and (2) to determine how these factors affected graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor-host-tolerance. AKR (H-2k) host mice were administered optimal or suboptimal total body irradiation (TBI) as pretransplant conditioning followed by administration of BM cells from B10.BR (H-2k) donor mice with or without added spleen cells as a source of T lymphocytes. Transplanted mice were injected with a supralethal dose of AKR leukemia cells 20 and 45 days post-BMT to assess GVL reactivity in vivo. The pretransplant conditioning of the host and T-cell content of the donor marrow affected the extent of donor T-cell chimerism and the severity of GVH disease. GVL reactivity was dependent on transplantation of mature donor T cells and occurred only in complete chimeras. Transplantation of T-cell-deficient BM resulted in the persistence of host T cells, ie, incomplete donor T-cell chimerism, even when lethal TBI was used. Mixed chimerism was associated with a lack of GVL reactivity, despite the fact that similar numbers of donor T cells were present in the spleens of mixed and complete chimeras. In this model, moderate numbers of donor T cells facilitated complete donor T-cell engraftment, caused only mild GVHD, and provided a significant GVL effect without preventing the subsequent development of tolerance after conditioning with suboptimal TBI. In contrast, severe, often lethal, GVHD developed when the dose of TBI was increased, whereas tolerance and no GVH/GVL reactivity developed when the T-cell content of the marrow was decreased. 
Endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. BACKGROUND. Primary care physicians often make decisions about the use of endocarditis prophylaxis (EP). Compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations has been found to be poor in hospitalized patients and in a dental school clinic. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. METHODS. The problem list of all adult patients seen in a primary care clinic in 1989 was reviewed for diagnoses that might require EP. Eighty-four charts were identified and reviewed. RESULTS. Sixty-five percent of the study patients had documentation in their charts about the need for EP. Mitral valve prolapse was the most frequent diagnosis. The physicians recommended EP for most patients with mitral valve prolapse regardless of whether there was documented mitral insufficiency. Endocarditis prophylaxis was most commonly prescribed for dental procedures. Six patients received prophylaxis for procedures for which the AHA does not recommend prophylaxis. Only 19% of the antibiotic regimens prescribed were entirely consistent with the AHA 1984 guidelines. The most common deviation from the AHA guidelines was continuing oral antibiotics too long. CONCLUSIONS. Compliance with the AHA 1984 recommendations, although better than reported in other settings, was less than optimal in this primary care clinic. Family physicians should consider whether EP is indicated in any patient with cardiac disease. If prophylaxis is indicated, then such a recommendation should be clearly documented in the chart. Family physicians need to be familiar with the 1990 AHA recommendations. 
Lightning and its effects on the auditory system. Patients struck by lightning can present with a wide variety of unusual otologic problems including burns to the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane rupture, middle ear injury, and sensorineural hearing loss. Four patients who incurred various otologic problems, including one patient with previously unreported bilateral oval window fistulas following lightning injury, are presented. Audiologic, otologic, and surgical findings are reviewed as well as patient follow-up and outcome. 
High levels of p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma are associated with advanced stage disease and with N-myc gene amplification. The gene encoding a novel protein designated nm23-H1, which was recently identified as identical to the A subunit of nucleotide diphosphate kinase from human erythrocytes, has been proposed to play a role in tumor metastasis suppression. We report that untreated neuroblastoma tumors contain a cellular polypeptide (Mr = 19,000) designated p19, identified in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels, which occurs at significantly higher levels (P = 0.0001) in primary tumors containing amplified N-myc gene. The partial amino acid sequence obtained for p19 is identical to the sequence of the human nm23-H1 protein. An antibody to the A subunit of erythrocyte nucleotide diphosphate kinase reacted exclusively with p19. In this study, significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 occurred in primary neuroblastoma tumors from patients with advanced stages (III and IV) relative to tumors from patients with limited stages (I and II) of the disease. Even among patients with a single copy of the N-myc gene, tumors from patients with stages III and IV had statistically significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 than tumors from patients with stages I and II. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to a proposed role for nm23-H1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor, increased p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma is correlated with features of the disease that are associated with aggressive tumors. Therefore, nm23-H1 may have distinct if not opposite roles in different tumors. 
Atrial natriuretic factor modulates the plasma levels of a Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor in volume expanded borderline hypertensives. To evaluate the existence of a relationship between atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity in humans, we examined the hemodynamic and humoral response to volume expansion in 41 borderline hypertensive patients (BHT) with either normal (n = 33) or low plasma renin activity (n = 8). The study was carried out by measuring blood pressure, forearm circulation, plasma renin activity (PRA), ANF, and plasma levels of an endogenous Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor before and after 2 h of acute intravenous NaCl infusion (0.22 mL/min/kg bodyweight). The early (45 min) changes of ANF and those of Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity attained at the end of saline infusion were inversely related in BHT with normal PRA and directly related in the low-PRA population (r = 0.64). The time-course of ANF response to sodium loading was significantly delayed in BHT characterized by normal venous distensibility. They also showed a greater increase in plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity occurring with an hypertensive, vasoconstrictive, and sodium retaining response as well. We conclude that in normal PRA borderline hypertensives, ANF may modulate the release of a plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor in a setting where extracellular volume is acutely expanded. Our findings also suggest that dissimilarities in peripheral venous distensibility are able to influence the time-course of ANF response. The blunted ANF increase observed in response to NaCl loading in a subset of BHT could represent an early marker of the attitude of such patients to develop high blood pressure leading to the release of a Na(+)-pump inhibitor and influencing individual salt-sensitivity. 
Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. 
The effect of chronic orthopedic infection on quality of life. The patient with chronic orthopedic infection presents a unique challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon must not only possess an expertise in constantly evolving diagnostic and treatment techniques but also be able to identify numerous related problems and direct the patient in receiving the most appropriate treatment. This demands a commitment of time by the treating surgeon to the individual patient to properly assess the need for support, the extent of psychologic distress, the intensity of pain, and the requirement for medication management. The effective utilization of a multidisciplinary team of health care providers (e.g., specialists in infectious disease, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, nursing, pharmacology) can provide an optimal treatment program for this multifaceted problem and maximize the potential for a favorable outcome. 
Probability of appendicitis before and after observation. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine patients with abdominal pain for changes in probability of appendicitis during observation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated community hospital. METHODS: 252 patients with abdominal pain who were examined underwent short-term (10.4 hours) observation (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7, 12.1) before the decision to operate during a one-year period. Alvarado's scoring system and a probability-of-diagnosis nomogram were used to assign scores and estimate probability of appendicitis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In the study group, mean score of patients with appendicitis increased after observation from 6.8 (95% CI, 6.2, 7.4) to 7.8 (95% CI, 7.3, 8.3), corresponding to a change in probability of appendicitis from 50% to 65%. Mean score of patients without appendicitis decreased from 3.8 (95% CI, 3.5, 4.1) to 1.6 (95% CI, 1.58, 1.62), corresponding to a change in probability from 35% to 22%. The difference between mean scores for patients with and without appendicitis increased from 2.6 (95% CI, 2.0, 3.2) to 6.2 (95% CI, 6.15, 6.25) during observation. The study group initially had intermediate probability of appendicitis (score, 4.35; 95% CI, 4.04, 4.66) compared with high probability for patients who went directly to surgery after their initial evaluation (63 patients; score, 7.59; 95% CI, 7.05, 8.73) and low probability for patients with abdominal pain who were sent home after their initial evaluation without observation or surgery (2,097 patients; score, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.48, 2.26). CONCLUSION: In this group of patients with intermediate initial probability of appendicitis, observation improved the ability to distinguish patients with from those without appendicitis. 
Cardiac epinephrine synthesis. Regulation by a glucocorticoid. BACKGROUND. The heart can synthesize epinephrine. Homogenates of rat heart, which contain the enzymes phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and nonspecific N-methyltransferase (NMT), methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine. The cardiac atrium contains primarily PNMT and the cardiac ventricle contains both PNMT and NMT. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats were given the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at doses ranging from 0.2 to 20 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours later, cardiac atria, ventricle, skeletal muscle, and adrenal had increases in PNMT activity to as much as 230% of baseline. NMT activity was unchanged. Longer-term treatment with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone daily for 12 days increased cardiac PNMT activity about fivefold and also increased atrial epinephrine levels. Dexamethasone did not alter ventricular epinephrine levels but increased levels of both PNMT and catechol-O-methyltransferase, the major catabolic enzyme for epinephrine. After dexamethasone treatment, greater volumes of anti-PNMT antiserum were needed to decrease PNMT enzymatic activity, indicating that dexamethasone treatment resulted in greater amounts of PNMT and did not just activate existing PNMT molecules. Denervation of the masseter muscle of rats by unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy markedly diminished tissue norepinephrine and epinephrine levels but had no effect on masseter PNMT or NMT levels. We have previously shown that chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine increases cardiac PNMT levels. These findings suggest that PNMT is an extraneuronal enzyme in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS. Glucocorticoids have several cardiovascular effects, including increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Enhanced cardiac epinephrine synthesis may mediate some of these glucocorticoid effects. 
Experimental hypertension. Several interventions are used to induce hypertension in the experimental animal. The three most used interventions are renal ischemia, mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic manipulation. The sequence of events leading from these initiating manipulations to the elevated arterial pressure is being explored to define the mechanism responsible for hypertension. The following mechanisms are currently extensively evaluated: Pressor and depressor factors of renal origin, neurogenic regulation, circulating humoral factors, vessel wall hypertrophy, and membrane transport abnormality. The experimental models of hypertension hold great promise in providing an understanding of the mechanisms and developing effective treatment in clinical hypertension. 
Group C streptococcal bacteremia: analysis of 88 cases. Eighty-eight cases of group C streptococcal bacteremia were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had underlying diseases (72.7%), predominantly cardiovascular disease (20.5%) or malignancy (20.5%). The infection originated most often from the upper respiratory tract (20.5%), the gastrointestinal tract (18.2%), or the skin (17.1%). Prior exposure to animals or animal products was reported in 23.9% of cases. The most common clinical manifestations of group C streptococcal bacteremia were endocarditis (27.3%), primary bacteremia (22.7%), and meningitis (10.2%). Of streptococcal isolates, 61.4% were not speciated, 19.3% were Streptococcus equisimilis, 17.1% were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and two (2.3%) were Streptococcus equi. The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics, and most patients were treated with beta-lactam agents. Mortality was high (25.0%), especially among older patients and patients with endocarditis, meningitis, and disseminated infection. Group C streptococcal bacteremia does not differ from bloodstream infection caused by other beta-hemolytic streptococci with regard to clinical presentation, treatment, or outcome. 
Chordoma of the petrous bone. We have presented two cases of chordoma arising from an unusual location within the skull. Chordomas in the skull usually arise from within the body of the clivus, reputedly from notochordal remnants. The first case, which was diagnosed both with CT and MRI, had its origin from the petrous bone, with extension into the left cerebellopontine angle. Chordoma was not considered high on the list of differential diagnoses. A right pontine hemorrhage, which was evacuated surgically, was diagnosed in the second case both from its clinical appearance and from that on CT scan. Only when bone windowing technique was used with CT was a lytic lesion of the right petrous bone evident. Chordoma was only diagnosed on autopsy. In reviewing these two cases and the literature, it is evident that chordoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of erosive lesions of the petrous bone. 
Anaesthesia for Proteus syndrome. A 14-year-old boy with Proteus syndrome presented for orthopaedic surgery to his legs. No report in the literature exists on anaesthesia for this condition. Our patients posed airway problems that were managed by tracheal intubation under sedation using a fibreoptic bronchoscope. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane in oxygen. His lungs were ventilated mechanically throughout surgery, which was uneventful. 
Sudden death and paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction in stiff-man syndrome. Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension. Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons. 
Arrhythmias in heart failure--therapeutic challenges. Electrophysiologic disorders are common at all stages of heart failure due to myocardial mechanical factors, neuroendocrine disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, or ischemia, and also because of cardiovascular drugs. The prevalence of various forms of heart block, bradycardias, and arrhythmias in heart failure is largely unknown, as is their relationship to the etiology of the syndrome. Complex and multiform ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are common, and their frequency is broadly related to the severity of heart failure. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common features of the syndrome. The heart failure syndrome has an ominous prognosis. Approximately half the patients die suddenly, but the causal relationship between preexisting arrhythmias and sudden death is not known. Equally vital is knowledge of the influence of drug therapy on the arrhythmias of heart failure, but at present this is scarce and needs further study. 
Mastoid obliteration with the temporoparietal fascia flap. Obliteration of persistently discharging open mastoid cavities is one surgical option to achieve a dry ear. All the currently described techniques involve the use of random pattern local tissue flaps or free grafts. Ten patients have undergone obliteration procedures using the vascularized temporoparietal fascia flap. This resulted in rapid epithelialization by six weeks in seven out of 10 cases. The remaining three patients have persistent non healed areas over the medial attic wall, but are not troubled by otorrhoea. The indications, technique and complications of mastoid obliteration by this axial pattern flap are described. 
Quantitative comparison of aromatase induction by dexamethasone in fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance and a patient with cortisol hyperreactive syndrome. The ability of dexamethasone to induce aromatase activity was tested in fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance, a patient with cortisol hyperreactive syndrome, and five normal subjects. Dexamethasone increased enzyme activity in all cases in a concentration-dependent manner (over a range of 1-1000 nmol/L). In fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance, the response curve of dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity was shifted to the right compared to that of normal cells. However, the maximal induction of the enzyme at 1 mumol/L dexamethasone was unchanged in cortisol-resistant fibroblasts. On the other hand, in fibroblasts from the patient with the cortisol hyperreactive syndrome, the half-maximal effect of dexamethasone was similar to that in normal cells, but maximum induction of aromatase activity was 2 times greater than that in normal cells. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 inhibited dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity in these patients' cells and in normal cells in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the altered effects of dexamethasone on aromatase induction observed in each cell type were mediated through glucocorticoid receptors. 
Prevention of stress-induced erosive gastritis by parenteral administration of arachidonic acid. Stress-induced mucosal ulcerations are associated with a decreased synthesis of mucosal prostaglandin (PG) E2. This phenomenon is poorly understood. To investigate whether it is due to a decreased availability of the necessary substrates to the mucosa, four groups of 10 Holtzman rats were studied: group 1 received normal saline by intraperitoneal (ip) injection; group 2 also received ip normal saline, then were submitted to stress, by the cold restraint method; group 3 received a solution of arachidonic acid (AA) ip; and group 4 also received ip AA, then were submitted to stress. After sacrifice, the number of gastric ulcerations were counted and specimens of nonulcerated mucosa were assayed for PGE2 by high-performance liquid chromatography; the mean numbers of ulcers were 0, 5.8, 0.8, and 3 and the mean levels of PGE2 were 55, 41, 125, and 62 pg/mg of wet tissue for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that parenteral administration of AA reduces but does not completely eliminate stress-induced gastric ulcerations and that the stressed animals synthesized half as much PGE2 as the nonstressed ones after ip administration of equal amounts of AA, suggesting that stress reduces the availability of AA to the gastric mucosa, possibly by vascular spasm. 
Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery operation: determinants of early and late results. Mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported as being associated with a higher mortality than either mitral valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting alone. Cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation have been reported as related to mortality. To study the correlation of the cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation to hospital mortality and long-term survival, we analyzed the results of 135 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting between June 1974 and August 1989. The hospital mortality was 11.8% (16/135). Fifteen preoperative and operative variables were tested for correlation with hospital or late mortality using univariate tests and multivariate regression. Advanced age (greater than 60 years), New York Heart Association functional class, and wall motion score were independently associated with hospital mortality (p less than 0.05). The cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation were not related to hospital mortality or long-term survival (p greater than 0.05). The follow-up rate was 96.6% for the hospital survivors (115/119). Mean follow-up was 52.6 +/- 4.1 months. There were 35 late deaths. Survival was 91.9%, 89.9%, 78%, and 49.9% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 postoperative years, respectively. Preoperative New York Heart Association functional class and use of catecholamines during the postoperative intensive care period were independently related to late survival (p less than 0.05). 
Temporary external DDD pacing after cardiac operations. Temporary atrial and ventricular pacing in the DVI, VVI, and AOO modes using atrioventricular sequential DVI devices is routinely used in cardiac operations. This study evaluated a new temporary external DDD pacemaker (Medtronic 5345 External Pulse Generator) capable of ten pacing modes. Thirty-nine devices have been applied to 38 adult patients (27 male, 11 female) after a variety of open heart procedures. Group 1 had atrial pacing wires placed 1.5 to 2.0 cm apart superiorly on the right atrium, group 2 had atrial wires placed 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart on the right atrial free wall, and group 3 had atrial wires placed on the right atrial free wall 0.8 cm apart, using a Silastic ring for fixation. Ventricular wires were placed on the free wall (group 1) or the diaphragmatic surface (groups 2 and 3) of the right ventricle. Postoperative atrial and ventricular sensing and pacing thresholds were obtained on return to the intensive care unit; analysis of variance demonstrated a significantly greater atrial sensing threshold in group 3. Four patients in group 1 permanently lost atrial sensing, 1 patient in group 2 intermittently lost atrial sensing at 24 hours with return at 36 hours postoperatively, and 1 patient in group 1 lost ventricular sensing capability. All other patients had adequate atrial and ventricular sensing capability documented until elective pacemaker removal (mean, 166 hours; range, 17 to 667.5 hours). Nineteen patients required some form of temporary pacing postoperatively; 11 patients demonstrated hemodynamic benefit from a pacing mode that is not available on the currently used DVI devices, and 7 of these required true DDD pacing capability. Six patients benefited from atrial pacing with adequate atrial sensing and simultaneous ventricular backup. Burst pacing with the device was used successfully to treat postoperative atrial flutter in 2 patients. We conclude that temporary external DDD pacing is feasible and effective in postoperative cardiac surgical patients. Atrial sensing is possible in most patients but electrode positioning is important for adequate thresholds. In some patients, hemodynamic as well as electrophysiologic improvement can be demonstrated with universal DDD pacing capability as compared with standard DVI pacing. 
Perilymph fistulas: the House Ear Clinic experience. The diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical treatment of perilymph fistulas has recently been the focus of a great deal of attention in otology. Authors have focused on perilymph fistulas as the cause of hearing loss and vertigo in many diverse situations. Additionally, surgical repair has been suggested when there is little objective support for intervention. To address some of the problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of perilymph fistulas, records of patients operated on at the House Ear Clinic during the past 12 years were reviewed retrospectively. Eighty-six patients were surgically explored for fistulas during this period. Thirty-five (40.7%) fistulas were found, and 51 ears were patched whether fistulas were found or not. Of the 80 patients who were seen for follow-up, 35 (43.8%) were subjectively better, and 45 (56.2%) were the same. Although the number of fistulas found and the number of patients improved were similar, the composition of the two groups was different. On the basis of audiometric results, improvement in hearing occurred in only 18.7% of the patients. None of the demographic factors or diagnostic tests were predictive of either the presence of a fistula or the therapeutic outcome. Further work is required to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of fistulas and to design appropriate surgical intervention. 
Intractable epilepsy and structural lesions of the brain: mapping, resection strategies, and seizure outcome. Forty-seven patients with structural brain lesions on neuroimaging studies and partial epilepsy intractable to medical therapy were studied. Prolonged noninvasive interictal and ictal EEG recording was performed, followed by more focused mapping using chronically implanted subdural electrode plates. Surgical procedures included lesion biopsy, maximal lesion excision, and/or resection of zones of epileptogenesis depending on accessibility and involvement of speech or other functional areas. The epileptogenic zone involved exclusively the region adjacent to the structural lesion in 11 patients. It extended beyond the lesion in 18 patients. Eighteen other patients had remote noncontiguous zones of epileptogenesis. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with complete lesion excision regardless of extent of seizure focus excision. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 5 of 6 patients (83%) with incomplete lesion excision but complete seizure focus excision and in 12 of 23 patients (52%) with incomplete lesion excision and incomplete focus excision. The extent of lesion resection was strongly associated with surgical outcome either in itself (p less than 0.003), or in combination with focus excision. Focus resection was marginally associated with surgical outcome as a dichotomous variable (p = 0.048) and showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.07) only as a three-level outcome variable. We conclude that structural lesions are associated with zones of epileptogenesis in neighboring and remote areas of the brain. Maximum resection of the lesion offers the best chance at controlling intractable epilepsy; however, seizure control is achieved in many patients by carefully planned subtotal resection of lesions or foci. 
Etidronate for hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis. The biphosphonates are becoming well established as effective agents for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Etidronate disodium is the only biphosphonate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Accepted indications for etidronate therapy are symptomatic Paget's disease, heterotopic ossification and hypercalcemia of malignancy. An unapproved, but apparently successful use is treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Both oral and intravenous preparations are available. Newer biphosphonates, which may be more efficacious and less toxic than etidronate, are being studied. 
Chronic urticaria and cancer: an epidemiological study of 1155 patients. To evaluate the possible association of malignant disease with chronic urticaria 1155 consecutive cases with chronic urticaria were reviewed. The Swedish Cancer Registry, Stockholm, was searched for records reporting malignancies in the study population (1958-84), and the expected number of malignancies was calculated on the basis of age- and sex-standardized incidence data. A malignancy was diagnosed in 36 patients with urticaria and the expected number of malignancies was 41. In 23 patients the malignancy appeared during the same year as the onset of urticaria or later. The expected number was 25.6. We conclude that chronic urticaria is not statistically associated with malignancy in general. 
Lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, and fetal loss. A case-control study. BACKGROUND. Lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies are antiphospholipid antibodies that have been associated with fetal loss, but they have not been shown unequivocally to be a risk factor for this event. METHODS. To estimate the risk of fetal loss in association with these antibodies, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 331 women with spontaneous abortion or fetal death (case patients) and 993 controls. The subjects were included in the study only if they reported that they had had no previous spontaneous fetal loss. Each control was a pregnant woman who, in the same period of pregnancy as a case patient, had not had a fetal loss. Lupus anticoagulants were identified in blood samples through a series of coagulation tests, and IgG anticardiolipins by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each subject was interviewed in person to obtain information on potential confounding variables, such as sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions. RESULTS. Lupus anticoagulants were found in blood from 17 case patients (5.1 percent) and 38 controls (3.8 percent). The crude odds ratio for the association between lupus anticoagulants and fetal loss was 1.36 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 2.43); the odds ratio adjusted for confounders was 1.42 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 2.80). An IgG anticardiolipin level of 5 units or more was found in 4 case patients (1.2 percent) and 15 controls (1.5 percent). The crude and adjusted odds ratios for fetal loss were 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 2.41) and 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 4.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. There is not apparent justification for considering lupus anticoagulants or IgG anticardiolipins to be risk factors for fetal loss among women who present with spontaneous abortion or fetal death and have had no previous spontaneous fetal loss. 
Central nervous system germinomas. A review. The germinoma represents a less malignant form of germ cell tumor. Depending on the individual's age, this neoplasm constitutes approximately 0.1% to 3.4% of all intracranial tumors. The embryologic origin remains a mystery; however, current theories implicate an aberration in primordial germ cell migration. Clinical presentation depends on tumor location and may involve endocrine, hypothalamic, visual, and cognitive dysfunction. In evaluating midline intracerebral masses, it is imperative that one be aware of the various radiologic appearances, endocrinologic changes, and chemical markers that help to distinguish germinomas from other neoplasms that appear in the pineal, suprasellar, and periventricular regions. Only through the careful evaluation of all available studies can the physician institute appropriate therapies such as biopsy, radiation, and chemotherapy. This article focuses on the epidemiology, embryology, clinical presentation, means of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this rare neoplasm. 
Wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy with immediate glottic and pharyngeal reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap: preliminary results. We propose a new technique of wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy which combines resection of laterally localized extended pharyngolaryngeal tumors with immediate microsurgical reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap, including the tendon of the palmaris longus. It eliminates the limitations of resections, which are usually performed to avoid closure difficulties of the resulting defect. In addition, the new technique avoids the use of tumor-neighboring structures for closure, fulfilling the oncological principles of surgery performed in this region. Our preliminary results show good restored deglutition and phonation. Postoperative irradiation does not seem to affect these results. 
Insulin regulation of the glucagon gene is mediated by an insulin-responsive DNA element. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin deficiency and high plasma glucagon levels, which can be normalized by insulin replacement. It has previously been reported that glucagon gene expression is negatively regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level. By transfection studies, I have now localized a DNA control element that mediates insulin effects on glucagon gene transcription. This element also confers insulin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. DNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with this insulin-responsive element are found in both glucagon- and non-glucagon-producing cells; and the pattern of binding, as assessed by the gel retardation assay, is not modified by prior insulin treatment. 
Pain reduction interventions during neonatal circumcision. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some noninvasive pain reduction interventions on pain in 121 neonates undergoing unanesthetized circumcision. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six groups: classical music, intrauterine sounds, pacifier, music and pacifier, intrauterine sounds and pacifier, or control (no nurses present and no pain reduction interventions used). Physiological variables that were monitored were heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (tcpO2), rate pressure product, and behavioral state, measured during 14 circumcision steps. Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal. Few significant differences were found among any of the steps. SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps. 
Selective depletion of macrophages prevents pituitary-adrenal activation in response to subpyrogenic, but not to pyrogenic, doses of bacterial endotoxin in rats. The mechanisms by which bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] stimulates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) have not been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of macrophages in plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to LPS administration in rats using selective in vivo macrophage depletion. Intraperitoneal administration of subpyrogenic doses of LPS to normal rats resulted in elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations, measured 2 h later. The response showed a remarkable steep dose relationship, with minimal effective doses between 0.5-1.5 micrograms (ACTH) and 0.5 micrograms or less (corticosterone)/kg BW. Plasma PRL, LH, and catecholamine (norepinephrine, epinephrine) levels were not significantly changed under the conditions used. Only at 6 h after LPS administration was a small elevation of norepinephrine noted. To deplete macrophages, rats were injected with liposomes encapsulated with dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP). Histochemical (acid phosphatase) and immunocytochemical techniques (monoclonal antibodies to rat macrophages coded ED1 and ED3) were applied to examine the efficiency of macrophage elimination by the Cl2MDP liposomes in cytospins of peritoneal exudates and in sections of the liver and spleen. Since cells of the macrophage lineage are considered to be the main source of IL-1 in the circulation, we also measured circulating levels of immunoreactive interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) concentrations in control and Cl2MDP liposome-treated rats by the use of a newly developed RIA. Reduced numbers of macrophages were seen in peritoneal lavages of Cl2MDP liposome-treated animals, whereas the morphological appearance and numbers of mast cells, granulocytes, and T-cells were unaffected. Similarly, macrophages were effectively eliminated in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver, as inferred from the reduction of macrophage staining in these organs. Plasma IL-1 concentrations could only be detected in response to a pyrogenic (2.5 mg/kg, iv) and not to a subpyrogenic (0.025 mg/kg, ip) dose of LPS. The increase in plasma IL-1 concentrations in response to the pyrogenic dose of LPS, reaching levels of 20-40 ng/ml in control rats, was blunted in animals treated with the Cl2MDP liposomes. Macrophage depletion by Cl2MDP liposomes did not affect either resting plasma corticosterone levels or the corticosterone response to ether exposure. At subpyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were completely prevented by macrophage depletion. In contrast, at pyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were not significantly affected by depleting macrophages. These data demonstrate that activation of the HPAA by a subpyrogenic dose of LPS is macrophage dependent. However, macrophage-independent mechanisms mediate activation of the HPAA in response to a pyrogenic dose of LPS. 
Hypercholesterolemia in adolescents: effectiveness of screening strategies based on selected risk factors. This study evaluates the efficacy of the American Academy of Pediatrics' current recommendations for identifying hypercholesterolemia in teenagers. These guidelines advocate a screening strategy that is targeted only at high-risk individuals. Detailed information regarding risk factors for hypercholesterolemia was obtained from 1001 adolescents or their parents at three urban teen clinics during routine health assessments. In addition, serum cholesterol was measured in all adolescents. The population under study was 38.2% Hispanic, 33.5% white, 15.4% black, and 11.3% Asian, with a mean age of 15.6 years (range: 12 through 21 years); 52% were female. Based on the cholesterol values, the study population was divided into two groups: (1) normal cholesterol level, less than 200 mg/dL (n = 937, mean cholesterol value = 157 mg/dL) and (2) elevated cholesterol level, greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (n = 64, mean cholesterol value = 228 mg/dL, range = 200 through 366 mg/dL). Application of the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for selected screening identified 30 of 64 individuals with hypercholesterolemia (sensitivity = 47%). Criteria similar to 1988 recommendations identified 40 of 64 teenagers (sensitivity = 62%). A combination of 1985 and 1988 criteria yielded a sensitivity of 44 of 64, or 69%. The specificity of these criteria was 74%, 60%, and 53%, respectively. Despite the utilization of the 1985, 1988, or a combination of both American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for hypercholesterolemia screening, this study demonstrates that many adolescents with abnormal cholesterol levels would not be identified. 
Colonic-type adenocarcinoma of male urethra. A case of a rare primary urethral carcinoma is presented. The histochemical characteristics of this tumor are identical to those of colon tumors. The patient was treated with segmental urethrectomy. 
U.S. experience with omeprazole in duodenal ulcer. Multicenter double-blind comparative study with ranitidine. The Omeprazole DU Comparative Study Group. To assess the comparative efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg, a proton pump inhibitor, versus ranitidine 150 mg twice a day, an H2-receptor antagonist, in healing duodenal ulcers we performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 309 patients with endoscopically diagnosed ulcers. Patients were treated for up to four weeks and were seen at week 2 and at week 4, if unhealed at week 2, for determination of ulcer status by endoscopy, review of daily self-assessment symptom diaries, and clinical laboratory including fasting serum gastrin. Gastrin levels were repeated two weeks after cessation of study medication. Evaluation of baseline demographic and laboratory parameters demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups at entry. At week 2, 42% of the omeprazole and 34% of the ranitidine-treated patients were healed (P = NS). At week 4, there was a 19% advantage in ulcer healing for the omeprazole-treated patients in comparison to those treated with ranitidine (82% vs 63%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Healing of ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm occurred in 83% of those treated with omeprazole versus 37% treated with ranitidine (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in rate of pain relief or incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities. Mean fasting serum gastrin value during treatment increased over the baseline in both groups, (P less than 0.05). The percent change was significantly greater with omeprazole but few patients had elevations above the upper limit of normal for the assay. Both drugs were well tolerated. Omeprazole 20 mg demonstrated superiority in healing duodenal ulcers at four weeks in comparison to ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and was more effective in healing ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. 
Colloid oncotic pressure and body water dynamics in septic and injured patients. Colloid oncotic pressure (COP) and fluid shifts were studied in 43 septic (SS) patients and 33 injured (HS) patients (ISS = 48.2). During maximal postresuscitation fluid retention, plasma volume (PV/RISA), red cell volume (RBC/51Cr), inulin space (ECF), and COP were measured. Interstitial space (IFS), PV/IFS ratio, and correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. A subgroup of 22 SS patients and 22 HS patients of equal study weight were also compared. Septic patients had greater IFS expansion (17.6 L vs. 11.5 L) than HS patients who, by inference, had more intracellular expansion. Expansion of IFS in SS patients correlated (r = -0.76, p less than 0.02) with reduced plasma COP; this was not seen in HS patients (r = -0.09, p less than 0.35). In contrast, plasma COP correlated (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) with PV/RISA in HS patients but not in SS patients (r = 0.09, p greater than 0.35). We conclude: (1) SS patients with greater IFS expansion that correlates with reduced plasma COP likely have increased capillary permeability; and (2) HS patients with less IFS expansion that does not correlate with reduced plasma COP likely have maintained capillary permeability with altered IFS matrix configuration causing reduced protein exclusion. 
A randomized double-blind study of gallium nitrate compared with etidronate for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Gallium nitrate and the bisphosphonate, etidronate, are new agents that have recently become available for treatment of this disorder. To directly compare therapeutic effectiveness, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of gallium nitrate compared with etidronate for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Gallium nitrate was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 200 mg/m2/d. Etidronate was administered as a 4-hour IV infusion at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Both drugs were given daily for 5 consecutive days. Eligible patients had persistent moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia (total serum calcium [corrected for serum albumin] greater than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL) after 2 days of hospitalization and IV hydration. Seventy-one patients were randomized and treated. Twenty-eight of 34 patients (82%) who received gallium nitrate achieved normocalcemia compared with 16 of 37 patients (43%) who received etidronate (P less than .001). Patients who received etidronate required significantly greater amounts of IV fluids (P = .04) and more hypocalcemic drug treatment (P less than .05) during the poststudy period than patients who received gallium nitrate. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly longer median duration of normocalcemia for patients treated with gallium nitrate (8 days v 0 days, P = .0005). A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with gallium nitrate developed asymptomatic hypophosphatemia compared with patients treated with etidronate (97% v 43%, P less than .001). We conclude that gallium nitrate is highly effective and superior to etidronate for acute control of moderate-to-severe cancer-related hypercalcemia. 
Postural differences between asymptomatic men and women and craniofacial pain patients. A forward head position and rounded shoulders have been implicated in the development or perpetuation of craniomandibular disorders. Since women seek treatment for these problems more frequently than men, postural differences may account for the increased incidence of symptoms in women. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the sagittal head and shoulder posture of asymptomatic men and women and (2) to compare the posture of asymptomatic and symptomatic women to determine differences in sagittal plane posture. Subjects were 20 asymptomatic men and women volunteers and nine consecutive women patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of craniomandibular pain. The subjects were compared using a valid, reliable, computer-assisted slide digitizing system called the Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS). Asymptomatic men and women did not differ in the postural characteristics associated with craniomandibular disorders. Sagittal posture does not appear to be a gender-related factor in these disorders. Symptomatic women, however, do display these postural characteristics to a greater extent than asymptomatic women. Evaluation and treatment of postural dysfunction should be included in the management of these patients. 
Placental bed spiral arteries in the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--The investigation of the histology of the placental bed spiral arteries in normal pregnancy and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, with or without proteinura. DESIGN--An observational study, based on women having caesarean sections for clinical reasons. SUBJECTS--17 normal pregnant women, 43 with gestational hypertension, of whom 39 had proteinuria, 17 with chronic hypertension, of whom 6 had proteinuria, and 5 with unclassified hypertension. INTERVENTIONS--Placental bed biopsies obtained during caesarean section. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Histological appearance of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin PAS and Lendrum's MSB. RESULTS--Biopsies containing spiral arteries were obtained from 6 normotensive and 44 hypertensive women. Trophoblastic invasion was present in 5 of the 6 normotensive biopsies but absent in the majority of those with hypertension. Subintimal proliferation was seen in all the normotensive biopsies but in only 8 of 28 from those with gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Other features seen predominantly or only in the hypertensive biopsies, in order of frequency, were medial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, acute atherosis, endothelial vacuolation and thrombosis. CONCLUSION--Absence of physiological changes may not be peculiar to preeclampsia but may be associated or even a result of various forms of hypertension in pregnancy. Spiral arteries show a spectrum of changes in hypertensive pregnancies that do not appear to bear a clear-cut relation to the clinical signs. 
Capillary refill--is it a useful predictor of hypovolemic states? STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the capillary refill test can correctly differentiate between hypovolemic and euvolemic emergency department patients. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded time series. SETTING: The orthostatic and hypotensive patients were seen in a university hospital ED with 44,000 visits per year. Blood donors were studied in the hospital's blood donor center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two adult ED patients who presented with a history suggestive of hypovolemia and either abnormal orthostatic vital signs (19) or frank hypotension (13), and 47 volunteer blood donors who ranged in age from 19 to 83 participated. INTERVENTIONS: Capillary refill was measured before rehydration in the ED subjects and, in the donor group, before and after a 450-mL blood donation. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and study group. MAIN RESULTS: For the blood donor group, mean capillary refill time before donation was 1.4 seconds and after donation was 1.1 seconds. Mean capillary refill time for the orthostatic group was 1.9 seconds and for the hypotensive group was 2.8 seconds. When scored with age-sex specific upper limits of normal, the sensitivity of capillary refill in identifying hypovolemic patients was 6% for the 450-mL blood loss group, 26% for the orthostatic group, and 46% for the hypotensive group. The accuracy of capillary refill in a patient with a 50% prior probability of hypovolemia is 64%. Orthostatic vital signs were found to be more sensitive and specific than capillary refill in detecting the 450-mL blood loss. CONCLUSION: Capillary refill does not appear to be a useful test for detecting mild-to-moderate hypovolemia in adults. 
Restricted T cell expression of IL-2/IFN-gamma mRNA in human inflammatory disease. It has been difficult to demonstrate functionally distinct T cell populations in humans on the basis of cytokine secretion. As previous investigators have examined the T cell cytokine profile from immunized animals, we examined whether Th1 or Th2 type T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune compartments from subjects with or without inflammatory diseases. Using limiting dilution analysis and growth with PHA and IL-2/IL-4, we directly cloned a total of 177 T cells from the peripheral blood and CSF of seven subjects, four with inflammatory disease and three control subjects, and examined the cytokine message profile after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA. We found that most clones from both the peripheral blood and CSF express IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha cytokine mRNA after activation with ionomycin and PMA. All T cell clones tested produced TNF-alpha mRNA, and all but 14 produced IFN-gamma mRNA. As reported previously, Th0 cells, which produced IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA, were found in most subjects. In striking contrast, Th1 cells, which expressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not IL-4 or IL-5 mRNA, were present in both peripheral blood and CSF of subjects with inflammatory disease but not found in peripheral blood or CSF of subjects without systemic inflammation. Th2 cells, expressing IL-4 and IL-5 but not IFN-gamma or IL-2 mRNA, were not found in any subject. These data present the first evidence for Th1 T cell clones in humans that may be associated with systemic inflammation. 
A critical threshold of exercise capacity in the ventilatory response to exercise in heart failure. During exercise patients with chronic left heart failure ventilate more than normal individuals at the same workload; the ratio of minute ventilation to minute production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) is increased. The relation between increased VE/VCO2, severity of heart failure, and exercise capacity has not been defined. VE/VCO2 was measured in 47 patients with chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades II and III) and in 1009 healthy controls. Exercise capacity was assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) during progressive exercise. In the controls VO2max ranged from 25 to 93 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 17-36 and did not correlate with VO2max. In chronic left heart failure the VO2max ranged from 9 to 29 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 22-42 and correlated strongly with VO2max. End tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate at peak exercise were similar in the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure. The increase in VE/VCO2 on exercise in chronic left heart failure indicates increased physiological dead space, presumably caused by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure the relation of VE/VCO2 to VO2max was curvilinear with a threshold of VO2max below which VE/VCO2 started to rise above the normal range. This point of inflection may be explained by the existence of a critical level of cardiac function necessary to perfuse adequately all lung zones on exercise. 
Loss of both CSF1R (FMS) alleles in patients with myelodysplasia and a chromosome 5 deletion. A high proportion of patients with myelodysplasia show characteristic karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells. The most distinctive of the myelodysplastic syndromes is the 5q- syndrome characterized by refractory anemia, poorly lobulated megakaryocytes, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q deletion) as the sole karyotypic abnormality. Recently, several genes encoding hemopoietic growth factors and receptors, comprising the interleukins 3, 4, and 5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [the CSF1R (formerly FMS) gene product], have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, and there has been much speculation that deletion of one or more of these genes may be critical to the pathogenesis of the associated myeloid disorders. One candidate gene is CSF1R, which is required for normal proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. We have carried out a molecular examination of the CSF1R, both on the 5q- chromosome and on the apparently normal homologous chromosome 5, in 10 patients with myelodysplasia and a 5q deletion. We have found, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and gene dosage experiments, that all 10 patients showed deletion of CSF1R; 6 of 10 were hemizygous and 4 of 10 homozygous for CSF1R loss. The homozygous CSF1R loss has been confirmed in 2 patients by an in situ hybridization technique comparing the signal in affected cells to that in control sex-mismatched cells on the same slides. In those patients considered to have homozygous CSF1R loss by DNA experiments the gene was deleted from the 5q chromosome in all cells and from the apparently normal chromosome 5 in a subset of cells. This loss of one CSF1R allele, together with loss in some cells of the remaining allele on the homologous chromosome 5, in patients with myelodysplasia indicates that this is a region of critical gene loss on 5q. The loss of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor gene CSF1R may be important in the pathogenesis of human myeloid leukemia. 
Life-threatening angioedema. Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa. From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion. Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure. We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought. 
Brucellosis as a cause of severe colitis. A 16-yr-old girl presented with osteomyelitis and massive rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed severe nonspecific colitis. Multiple laboratory investigations failed to disclose the etiology of either the bone or colon infections. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and sulfasalazine resulted in only transient improvement. One month after discharge, her original symptoms recurred. Blood and pus cultures at this time yielded Brucella melitensis. After tetracycline treatment, the patient recovered. At 1-yr follow-up, she was found completely asymptomatic. Although osteomyelitis is a well-known manifestation of brucellosis, colitis related to this agent has so far not been described. 
Atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli in stroke patients. In 539 consecutive stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation department, we studied the possible role of atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by analyzing a series of relevant clinical data in patients with and without atrial fibrillation and in patients with and without venous thromboembolic complications. Deep venous thrombosis as well as advanced age and cardiac disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, in a model of simultaneous logistic regression carried out on the presence of absence of venous thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation was the only significant risk factor. In view of the morbidity and mortality linked to deep venous thrombosis, our findings argue for preventive anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and merit further study. 
Zoladex versus orchiectomy in treatment of advanced prostate cancer: a randomized trial. Zoladex Prostate Study Group. We report preliminary results for the first 164 patients enrolled in a multicenter study comparing the endocrine effects, efficacy, and safety of 3.6 mg of goserelin acetate (Zoladex) and orchiectomy in patients with Stage D2 prostate cancer. Eighty-one patients were randomly allocated to receive Zoladex and 83 to orchiectomy. The median follow-up time for all patients was two hundred ten days. Median serum levels of testosterone were reduced to castrate levels (less than 50 ng/dL) within four weeks in both groups and remained suppressed for up to sixty weeks. An objective response according to modified criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project was observed in 81 percent and 78 percent of patients in the Zoladex and orchiectomy groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the distributions of time to treatment failure or time to disease progression. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were hot flashes, cancer-related pain, unspecified pain, and urinary symptoms. These results suggest that Zoladex may offer an alternative to orchiectomy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. 
Lateral pharyngeal space abscess as a consequence of regional anesthesia. Trismus may be a complication from local anesthesia. Patients with trismus of unknown cause after dental treatment should be evaluated thoroughly. The dentist should perform a complete examination and establish a differential diagnosis to avoid missing a serious or life-threatening infection. A right lateral pharyngeal space infection developed after a general restorative procedure that involved an inferior alveolar nerve injection on the same side. The patient's severe trismus required awake intubation, incision and drainage while the patient was under general anesthesia, treatment with antibiotics and ten days of hospitalization. 
Occupational contact dermatitis due to acrylonitrile. Within DSM Chemicals BV, a producer of acrylonitrile, skin complaints are frequent. The majority of these are of an irritant nature, while a smaller portion is based on acquired allergies. Allergological examination revealed 5 employees with an allergy to acrylonitrile. 1 of these subjects also developed paraesthesiae in the skin sites affected, a finding not previously described for acrylonitrile. In the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT), acrylonitrile showed strong allergenic potential. For prevention and treatment of contact allergologic disorders, close cooperation between occupational health officer, dermatologist and toxicologist in chemical companies is recommended. 
The causes of hospital-treated acute lower respiratory tract infection in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic agents in children with acute lower respiratory infection. DESIGN: A survey of a series of patients. SETTING: General pediatric hospital serving an urban population with and without referrals in Helsinki, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: 135 Finnish children aged 2 months to 15 years (mean, 1.75 years), with clinically defined acute lower respiratory infection (with difficulty of breathing), or found to have fever and a pneumonic infiltrate on chest roentgenogram. SELECTION PROCEDURES: Consecutive sample on voluntary basis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Of 121 children with adequate samples, an etiologic diagnosis could be established in 84 (70%): 30 (25%) had bacterial, 30 (25%) viral, and 24 (20%) mixed infections. Antibody assays alone identified the agent in 91% of positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections are common but generally underestimated in acute lower respiratory infection; serologic methods add significantly to their detection. 
Unusual clinical presentation of malignant histiocytosis in a 70-year-old woman. A 70-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly, fever and elevated serum LDH levels. A biopsy specimen of the liver revealed histiocytic proliferation at the portal triad, and a mild degree of hepatitis. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of histiocytes with minimal immaturity and atypism, and haemophagocytosis by the proliferated histiocytes. Fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels all disappeared spontaneously, and presumptive diagnosis of benign reticulosis with haemophagocytosis was made. One year later, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels redeveloped, and the liver and bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of unequivocally malignant histiocytes. The patient died as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation with shock 20 d later. We concluded that, in this case, malignant histiocytosis first presented as benign haemophagocytic reticulosis and, 1 year later, there was a typical malignant presentation. 
Avoidance of tolerance and lack of rebound with intermittent dose titrated transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. The Transdermal Nitrate Investigators. OBJECTIVES--To investigate the efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate given continuously and with a nocturnal nitrate free period. DESIGN--Double blind placebo controlled study with two parallel limbs. SETTING--Multicentre trial. PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 to 108) (p less than 0.05), and total exercise duration increased by 40 seconds (p less than 0.05). These changes were not seen after continuous treatment. The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of "rebound" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment. 
Management of severe frontobasilar skull fractures. Immediate reconstruction of severely comminuted frontobasilar skull fractures involving the frontal sinus can be accomplished safely if the sinus is cranialized and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa is totally reconstructed. Operative time can be reduced if the pieces of the frontal bone are reassembled and stabilized with rigid fixation devices out of the surgical field and thus made ready for reinsertion as a single unit after any necessary neurosurgical procedures are completed. Immediate reconstruction provides postoperative protection for the brain and eliminates the need to return the patient to the operating room for cranioplasty at a later date. 
Nomenclature of vasculitic syndromes: a historical perspective. Since the original description of periarteritis nodosa (PAN) in 1866, the number of recognized forms of so-called idiopathic vasculitis has risen to about a dozen. Their relation to each other and their nature remain unclear, although the recent discovery of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) promises a clue to the origin of at least some of them, particularly Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and perhaps also Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, PAN appears to be a nonspecific syndrome of various etiologies. 
Comparative efficacy and safety of bepridil and diltiazem in chronic stable angina pectoris refractory to diltiazem. The Bepridil Collaborative Study Group. The efficacy and safety of bepridil hydrochloride (200 to 400 mg/day) were evaluated in patients with chronic stable angina refractory to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem (median 360 mg/day) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel study. Baseline diltiazem data were obtained during a 2-week period, after which 86 patients were randomized to bepridil (n = 46) or diltiazem (n = 40). Angina frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and ischemic manifestations induced by exercise treadmill testing were evaluated over 8 weeks. Bepridil significantly (p less than 0.05) increased time to angina onset, time to 1 and 2 mm of ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total work over baseline values. Changes in time to angina onset and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater for bepridil than for diltiazem. Angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with baseline, bepridil significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased heart rate (mean 4 beats/min) and prolonged QTc (mean 35 ms). The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were nausea, asthenia, dizziness, headache and diarrhea. Four patients taking bepridil and 1 taking diltiazem withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions. No sudden deaths, myocardial infarctions or instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes occurred in either group. The data indicate that bepridil provided safe and effective antianginal and antiischemic therapy in patients with chronic stable angina who exhibited less than optimal response to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem. 
Chemical meningism after lumbar facet joint block with local anaesthetic and steroids. A case is reported in which chemical meningism occurred after lumbar facet joint block with methylprednisolone acetate and bupivacaine. This complication was probably due to inadvertent dural puncture. The use of steroids in facet joint injections is questioned. 
Sural nerve morphometry in diabetic autonomic and painful sensory neuropathy. A clinicopathological study. Observations have been made on a selected series of insulin-dependent patients with neuropathy, subdivided into three groups: (1) severe autonomic neuropathy with an accompanying painless sensory neuropathy; (2) severe autonomic neuropathy with a chronic painful sensory neuropathy; and (3) chronic or acute painful sensory neuropathy with no autonomic neuropathy. All three groups showed a loss of large and small myelinated nerve fibres in sural nerve biopsy specimens which was greater in Groups 1 and 2. Regenerative activity was prominent in all three groups, but least in Group 3. Teased fibre studies showed evidence both of axonal regeneration and remyelination. Active fibre degeneration was rare. Measurements of g ratio (axon diameter:total fibre diameter) gave no indication of axonal atrophy. The density of unmyelinated axons was reduced in all three groups, as was their median diameter. Vibration sense threshold was positively correlated with the total number of myelinated fibres and thermal sensory threshold with median unmyelinated axon diameter but not with total unmyelinated axon numbers. No correlation between the occurrence of pain and active degeneration of myelinated fibres or with regenerative activity either in myelinated or unmyelinated axons was detectable. Assessment of differential loss of large or small myelinated nerve fibres was difficult because of the presence of large numbers of small regenerating myelinated axons. The results are discussed in relation to the concept of 'diabetic small fibre neuropathy' and the causation of pain in diabetic neuropathy. 
Four years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Brachial approach to emergency cardiac catheterization during thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. The use of the brachial approach to acute coronary intervention has not been previously studied. In the course of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials, we used the transbrachial approach to cardiac catheterization with or without angioplasty in 202 of 704 (28.6%) patients. The baseline characteristics of age, sex, risk factors, medical history, time from symptom onset to therapy, and left ventricular function were similar for the 2 different approaches. Time from therapy to coronary angiography was not delayed by the brachial approach compared with the femoral approach: 97.1 +/- 26 min vs. 99.9 +/- 133.8 min, respectively. Chemical patency was established in 78 vs. 73% of patients and technical success with acute PTCA with the brachial approach was 89% vs. 78% with the femoral approach. Clinical outcomes were quite similar with respect to death (6 vs. 6%), reocclusion (10 vs. 14%), and emergency coronary bypass surgery (5 vs. 6%). Baseline hematocrit was 43.9 +/- 4.4 and 43.5 +/- 4.8, respectively with a nadir of 32.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 33.0 +/- 5.4. The need for vascular repair occurred in 1% vs. 3% of patients and retroperitoneal hemorrhage was documented in 1% vs. 1% of patients. This study indicates that in the hands of experienced operators the transbrachial approach to acute coronary intervention in the acute phase of treatment with thrombolytic therapy can be used with equal risks and efficacy as the femoral approach. 
Human orthotopic small intestine transplantation: radiologic assessment. The authors describe the postoperative anatomy and review the radiologic examinations of five patients who underwent orthotopic small intestine or combined orthotopic liver and small intestine transplantation. Mucosal thickening of the transplanted intestine was demonstrated on the first postoperative contrast material-enhanced images and was due to submucosal edema. This resolved within 2 weeks in the long-term survivors. Bowel peristalsis appeared normal as early as 31 days after transplantation. Contrast-enhanced examinations of the intestine were useful to exclude surgical complications such as anastomotic leaks or strictures, but were insensitive for biopsy-proved cytomegalovirus enteritis or rejection. 
Renal and extra-renal levels of renin mRNA in experimental hypertension. 1. Using a ribonuclease-protection assay, renin mRNA levels were compared in the kidneys, livers, brains, hearts and adrenal glands of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats with those of age-matched control rats at 4 weeks ('early') and 20 weeks ('chronic') after clipping, and in the kidneys and adrenal glands of rats treated for 3 weeks with deoxycorticosterone and salt (deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension) with those of control rats. 2. While marked changes were observed in kidney renin mRNA levels in all three experimental groups compared with their respective controls, in most of the extra-renal tissue studied minimal, if any, difference was seen in renin mRNA levels between the hypertensive and control rats. 3. The findings suggest that in these extra-renal tissues renin gene expression is differently regulated from that in the kidney, and particularly that it is not profoundly affected by changes in the level of circulating angiotensin II. 4. An increase in renin mRNA was observed in the adrenal glands of the 'chronic' Goldblatt rats, which may be of relevance to the maintenance of hypertension in this model. 
Solitary colonic metastasis from renal-cell carcinoma 17 years after nephrectomy. Report of a case. Late recurrence of renal-cell carcinoma can present many years after nephrectomy. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first known case of solitary metastatic renal-cell carcinoma to the colon occurring 17 years after nephrectomy. 
Pedicle patch urethroplasty. The pedicle patch urethroplasty provides an alternative single-stage vascularised graft procedure for the repair of moderately severe hypospadias. Over a 7-year period, 38 primary hypospadias repairs were performed employing this technique. The fistula rate was 18% in the 34 patients reviewed, but there were few other significant complications. The operation is recommended when the urethral plate can be preserved and the penis straightened in boys who are unsuitable for a meatal-based flap. 
Brachial approach to management of an abdominal aortic occlusion with prolonged lysis and subsequent angioplasty. The brachial approach for recanalizing an abdominal aortic occlusion utilizing a combination of thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty is described. The patient was deemed too ill to permit any surgical intervention. The unique aspects of the procedure are described including angioplasty of the unmasked (by lytic therapy) aortoiliac bifurcation stenoses utilizing double wires and double balloons through a single arteriotomy site. The advantages of the brachial approach in managing this unusual entity are outlined. 
Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in the short-term treatment of hypertension with isradipine. This was a study of the effectiveness of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group, in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was effectively reduced at 90 days of treatment (from 129.5 +/- 2.0 to 111.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg; P less than .001). The electrocardiographic Romhilt-Estes score for LVH showed early reduction at 45 days of treatment (from 7.1 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 points; P less than .001), and further diminutions were observed at 90 days of treatment (3.8 +/- 0.4 points; P less than .01). The echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass indices confirmed these findings (from 175.0 +/- 8.9 to 141.7 +/- 5.5 and to 124.8 +/- 4.2 g/m2; P less than .001) for 45 and 90 days, respectively. The results indicate that isradipine is effective in reducing left ventricular mass and that these reductions are observed early in the course of treatment. 
Neutralization of low molecular weight heparin by polybrene prevents thromboxane release and severe pulmonary hypertension in awake sheep Protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation in patients is occasionally associated with life-threatening acute pulmonary hypertension. In a sheep model, we evaluated the effect on this adverse cardiopulmonary reaction of modifying the type of heparin (low molecular weight heparin compared with unfractionated heparin) and the type of heparin antagonist (polybrene compared with protamine). Protamine reversal of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and polybrene reversal of unfractionated heparin induced more than a 10-fold increase of plasma thromboxane B2 levels, a threefold increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, and a 25% decrease of PaO2. A similar adverse reaction followed protamine reversal of conventional unfractionated heparin. However, with polybrene (1 mg/kg) reversal of LMWH (1 mg/kg), we measured neither pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure was 22.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg at 1 minute after polybrene reversal of LMWH compared with 47.9 +/- 4.2 mm Hg after protamine reversal of unfractionated heparin, p less than 0.005 groups differ), hypoxemia (PaO2 was unchanged 2 minutes after polybrene compared with a decrease of 26 mm Hg 2 minutes after protamine, p less than 0.05), nor acute release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (thromboxane B2 was 0.2 +/- 0.1 at 1 minute after polybrene compared with 3.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml at 1 minute after protamine, p less than 0.005). The hemodynamic effects and mediator release were also benign after neutralization of larger doses of LMWH (3 mg/kg) by polybrene (3 mg/kg). The increases of activated clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time due to both types of heparin were completely reversed with polybrene. Anti-Xa activity increased to more than 3 IU/ml 4 minutes after LMWH anticoagulation (p less than 0.01) but was only partially neutralized by polybrene. Various polyanion-polycation complexes that are formed when heparin anticoagulation is reversed induce thromboxane release and acute pulmonary vasoconstriction in awake sheep. Reversal of LMWH anticoagulation with polybrene does not elicit this adverse reaction. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease. 
Late renal dysfunction in adult survivors of bone marrow transplantation. Until recently long-term renal toxicity has not been considered a major late complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Late renal dysfunction has been described in a pediatric population status post-BMT which was attributable to the radiation in the preparatory regimen. A thorough review of adults with this type of late renal dysfunction has not previously been described. Fourteen of 103 evaluable adult patients undergoing allogeneic (96) or autologous (7) bone marrow transplantation, predominantly for leukemia and lymphomas, at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) have had a syndrome of renal insufficiency characterized by increased serum creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, anemia, and hypertension. This syndrome developed at a median of 9 months (range, 4.5 to 26 months) posttransplantation in the absence of specific identifiable causes. The cumulative probability of having this renal dysfunction is 20% at 1 year. Renal biopsies performed on seven of these cases showed the endothelium widely separated from the basement membrane, extreme thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and microthrombi. Previous chemotherapy, antibiotics, and antifungals as well as cyclosporin may add to and possibly potentiate a primary chemoradiation marrow transplant renal injury, but this clinical syndrome is most analogous to clinical and experimental models of radiation nephritis. This late marrow transplant-associated nephritis should be recognized as a potentially limiting factor in the use of some intensive chemoradiation conditioning regimens used for BMT. Some selective attenuation of the radiation to the kidneys may decrease the incidence of this renal dysfunction. 
Pulmonary sequelae of prolonged total venoarterial bypass: evaluation with a new experimental model. Total normothermic venoarterial bypass was established in 6 healthy pigs over a period of 18 hours. A heparin-coated closed extracorporeal system was used and no heparin was administered systemically. During the bypass period the main pulmonary artery was occluded and the heart was maintained in a beating state. All the animals maintained stable hemodynamics and normal blood gases during the entire period of bypass. In the postbypass period, the central hemodynamics continued to be stable while the arterial oxygen tension (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.21) decreased significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05). The total body oxygen uptake, on the other hand, remained unaltered. All the animals died within 4 hours after weaning off the venoarterial bypass circuit on account of pulmonary edema in 2 and cardiac arrest in 4. Death was preceded by progressive pulmonary hypertension and lactacidosis in all the animals. Histological examination of the lungs showed pulmonary parenchymal damage ranging from interstitial edema to intraalveolar hemorrhage and parenchymal necrosis involving more than 80% of the pulmonary parenchyma. A normothermic total venoarterial bypass of 18 hours duration or more produces pulmonary edema of varying severity, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary parenchymal necrosis, and lactacidosis in healthy juvenile pigs, resulting uniformly in their death. Despite these sequelae the systemic arterial hypoxemia may only be mild to moderate. 
Evaluation and management of patients with both peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease. The prevalence of serious angiographic coronary artery disease ranges from 37% to 78% in patients undergoing operation for peripheral vascular disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcome after peripheral vascular surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patient-related factors and the nature of the peripheral vascular operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the peripheral vascular procedure. However, peripheral vascular surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential. All patients with peripheral vascular disease should be considered to be at lifelong risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and should undergo appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation and be treated accordingly. 
Perforation of the globe--a complication of peribulbar anaesthesia. Peribulbar anaesthesia has been recommended as a safer alternative to retrobulbar anaesthesia. We report a case of perforation of the globe sustained during peribulbar anaesthesia which resulted in blindness. Orbital injections are potentially dangerous, be they peribulbar or retrobulbar. To minimise the risk, short, blunt needles are advocated for the peribulbar route. 
Comparative study of sucralfate 2 grams twice daily versus sucralfate 1 gram four times daily in the treatment of benign gastric ulcers in outpatients. In a double-blind, randomized study, we compared the healing of gastric ulcer during a twice-daily regimen of 2 g sucralfate or sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. Patients receiving the former therapy received the tablets one-half hour before breakfast and at bedtime. Patients receiving sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. received their therapy 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and supper, and at bedtime. The study included 52 patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer; 41 patients completed the study. Healing was endoscopically assessed at 8 weeks and 12 weeks. After 8 and 12 weeks the healing rate for sucralfate 2 g b.i.d. was 67% and 92%, respectively; the healing rate of sucralfate 1 g q.i.d. was 59% and 71%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two regimens. The results suggest that 2 g sucralfate twice daily is as effective in the healing of gastric ulcer as 1 g sucralfate q.i.d. 
Cisplatin combination chemotherapy for elderly patients with urothelial tumours. The proportion of cancer patients who receive potentially curative therapy declines with increasing chronological age. Between January 1979 and January 1988, 36 patients aged from 76 to 84 years (median 78) consented to cisplatin combination chemotherapy. Eighteen patients received 1 to 7 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (median 5). This resulted in a drop in creatinine clearance rate from 70 +/- 28.5 ml/min to 49 +/- 20 ml/min. Eight patients (44%) are alive without evidence of disease, with a whole group median survival of 23 months. The dose intensity of cisplatin was found to predict recurrence. Eighteen other patients were treated for metastatic disease; 39% had an objective response after receiving 2 to 9 cycles (median 7). Only 2 patients (11%) are alive and free of disease. In this group no significant kidney damage occurred and the dose intensity of cisplatin did not predict response. Treatment resulted in a significant sepsis rate (39%) and 6 patients (17%) withdrew from treatment because of toxicity. It was concluded that cisplatin combination chemotherapy can be administered without treatment-related death and its efficacy is similar to that in younger patients. Age should not exclude patients from the potential benefit of such therapy. An important cause of reduced benefit from chemotherapy among elderly patients may be the reduced dosage of cisplatin. 
Haem arginate in acute hereditary coproporphyria. An 11 year old boy presented with severe acute hereditary coproporphyria. Despite supportive measures his condition deteriorated after admission. Haem arginate, started two days after presentation, produced appreciable inhibition of porphyrin precursor overproduction and clinical improvement. 
The depth of thermal necrosis using the CO2 laser: a comparison of the superpulsed mode and conventional mode. In order to compare the depth of thermal necrosis on human skin using the superpulse CO2 laser to the conventional CO2 laser, single impacts of various laser settings were fired at both ends of fusiform excisions done for other clinical purposes. These laser impacts were then examined histologically and the superpulse mode was found to limit the depth of thermal necrosis by approximately a factor of two. 
Altered beta adrenergic receptor function in subjects with symptomatic mitral valve prolapse. Individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) frequently show symptoms of a hyperadrenergic state. beta adrenergic receptor characteristics were compared in the lymphocytes of subjects with symptomatic MVP and control subjects during rest and exercise. At rest, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with high affinity, as determined from isoproterenol competition for (-)[125I]-iodopindolol binding sites, was greater in MVP subjects than in controls. With exercise, the proportion of high-affinity receptors in MVP subjects decreased to control levels. Isoproterenol stimulation of lymphocyte 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) also was greater in MVP subjects than in controls at rest, but not during exercise. Plasma catecholamine concentrations in MVP subjects were normal during both rest and exercise. Unlike exercise, isoproterenol infusion elicited clinical manifestations of increased adrenergic responsiveness in MVP subjects. The beta receptor in exercised MVP subjects exhibited unusually high affinity agonist binding (i.e. a lower dissociation constant KH than in either the same subjects at rest or exercised controls) and also abnormal coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (GS) of adenylate cyclase, as reflected by the inability of guanine nucleotide to convert the receptor to a low-affinity state. These findings suggest that functional alteration of the beta adrenergic receptor, in the absence of abnormal plasma catecholamine levels, might contribute to the hyperadrenergic state of MVP subjects at rest. However, desensitization of high affinity beta receptors or altered receptor-GS coupling might preserve normal adrenergic responsiveness during exercise. 
Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction from the left ventricle. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to describe a new technique for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction using radiofrequency energy delivered in the left ventricle. METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction using a catheter positioned across the tricuspid annulus was unsuccessful in eight patients with a mean +/- SD age of 51 +/- 19 years who had AV nodal reentry tachycardia (three patients), orthodromic tachycardia using a concealed midseptal accessory pathway, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter (two patients), or atrial fibrillation. Before attempts at catheter ablation of the AV junction, each patient had been refractory to pharmacological therapy, and four had failed attempts at either catheter modification of the AV node using radiofrequency energy or surgical and catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. Conventional right-sided catheter ablation of the AV junction using radiofrequency energy in six patients and both radiofrequency energy and direct current shocks in two patients was ineffective. The mean amplitude of the His bundle potential recorded at the tricuspid annulus at the sites of unsuccessful AV junction ablation was 0.1 +/- 0.08 mV, with a maximum His amplitude of 0.03-0.28 mV. A 7F deflectable-tip quadripolar electrode catheter with a 4-mm distal electrode was positioned against the upper left ventricular septum using a retrograde aortic approach from the femoral artery. Third-degree AV block was induced in each of the eight patients with 20-36 W applied for 15-30 seconds. The His bundle potential at the sites of successful AV junction ablation ranged from 0.06 to 0.99 mV, with a mean of 0.27 +/- 0.32 mV. There was no rise in the creatine kinase-MB fraction and no complications occurred. An intrinsic escape rhythm of 30-60 beats/min was present in seven of the eight patients. Each patient received a permanent pacemaker and has been asymptomatic during 3-13 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Catheter ablation of the AV junction can be achieved effectively and safely using radiofrequency energy delivered in the left ventricle when the conventional right-sided approach is unsuccessful. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects. The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome. Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients. The phenomenology of FS is then described. We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes. Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested. 
Phonolexical agraphia. Superimposition of acquired lexical agraphia on developmental phonological dysgraphia. Study of neuropsychological sequelae of a focal acquired brain lesion may bring out and help delineate the features of a compensated developmental language disorder and its anatomical substrate. A left-handed man with a history of phonological developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia learned in early adulthood to read and write using a lexical system. Following a small posterior right parietal infarct when aged 56 yrs he developed a severe agraphia displaying features of phonological dysgraphia with impaired segmentation and features of lexical agraphia. Writing was severely impaired for all classes of word and nonword stimuli but his errors did not resemble those attributable to a deficit in the system responsible for the short-term storage of the graphemic representation of a word (graphemic output buffer). These observations imply that an acquired lexical agraphia has been superimposed on his developmental phonological dysgraphia, resulting in a combined or 'phonolexical' agraphia. 
Siriraj stroke score and validation study to distinguish supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage from infarction. OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke. 
Vagal body tumors. Six cases of vagal body tumor are reviewed. All first presented as painless neck masses with normal cranial nerve function. Otologic symptoms were infrequent, occurring only with temporal bone involvement. In true vagal paragangliomas, cranial nerve and auditory function is usually preserved until there is extensive disease of the skull base. Tumor progression after radiotherapy was documented in four patients, three of whom were treated with 4500 cGy or more. One patient was found to have regional lymph node metastases. The six patients had a total of 10 head and neck paragangliomas, illustrating the high incidence of synchronous and metachronous lesions. Because of the high incidence of multiple lesions, these tumors threaten lower cranial nerves bilaterally in many instances. Because cranial nerve function is preserved until late, and because vagal and accessory nerve paralysis is usually unavoidable with resection, we advocate conservative treatment in selected cases. It may be reasonable to postpone surgery until cranial nerve impairment becomes evident or other vital structures are threatened. 
Changing pattern of pulmonary metastases with adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma: results from the multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study. The multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study (MIOS), a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma with a concurrent control group, registered 113 patients from June 1982 to August 1984. Preliminary analysis of the study indicated a significant event-free survival advantage favoring immediate adjuvant chemotherapy, (P less than .001). For patients treated with surgery alone or with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the lungs were involved in more than 80% of the relapses. Patients relapsing after surgery alone tended to relapse earlier (P less than .01), had more pulmonary nodules (P less than .01), and had more frequent bilateral pulmonary involvement (P less than .01) than those treated with immediate postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy. However, patients relapsing after treatment with surgery alone experienced a significantly longer interval to further disease progression (P less than .01) and improved survival after relapse (P = .01) when compared with patients who relapsed after treatment with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy. The only factor predictive of survival after relapse was if the patient could be made surgically disease-free after initial relapse (P = .03). 
Surgical treatment of limbic epilepsy associated with extrahippocampal lesions: the problem of dual pathology. The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment. 
Reduction of central nervous system ischemic injury in rabbits using leukocyte adhesion antibody treatment. Activated leukocytes appear to be directly involved in ischemic central nervous system injury. A surface glycoprotein (CD18) on the leukocyte is required for endothelial adherence and subsequent function and can be blocked with leukocyte adhesion antibody treatment. We used two animal models to determine the efficacy of anti-CD18 antibody treatment in preserving neurologic function after central nervous system ischemia. We gave a dose of 1 mg/kg anti-CD18 to treatment rabbits 30 minutes before inducing irreversible ischemia in the brain with intraarterial microspheres or in the spinal cord using reversible aortic occlusion. Treatment with anti-CD18 produced a significant reduction in neurologic deficits in the reversible spinal cord model, but not in the irreversible microsphere model. This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in central nervous system reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy. 
Radical hysterectomy morbidity in relation to age. The complications of radical hysterectomy in patients 65 years and older were compared with those in women younger than 65. There was no statistical difference in complication rates between the two groups, although the older women had a significantly higher incidence of preoperative medical problems. No surgical deaths occurred in either group. Our data indicate that selected older women can tolerate radical hysterectomy as well as younger ones. 
Impact of the Children's Epilepsy Program on parents. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Santiago, Chile to test the efficacy of the Children's Epilepsy Program, a child-centered, family-focused intervention developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A., using a counseling model for parents of children with seizure disorders to help them (a) deal with their anger, resentment, and grief related to the loss of a normal child; (b) increase their knowledge about caring for their child; (c) reduce anxieties related to having a child with a seizure disorder; and (d) improve their decision-making skills. All parents were pretested and then retested 5 months after the educational interventions. Parents in the experimental group (n = 185) and their children separately attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Comparison group parents (n = 180) and their children jointly attended three 2-h lecture sessions followed by question-and-answer periods. Although parents' overall knowledge of epilepsy was relatively high initially, it improved considerably in both comparison and experimental groups. With regard to anxiety, at the 5-month evaluation, experimental group parents and mothers in particular were more likely than control parents to state that they were less anxious (p less than 0.001), and their anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01). 
Cancer risk notification: psychosocial and ethical implications. Basic and medical science investigations have identified a growing number of risk factors important in carcinogenesis. By communicating cancer risk information in medical practice, we have the potential to motivate high-risk individuals to adhere to cancer prevention and surveillance protocols. However, cancer screening and risk notification might have adverse psychologic and social consequences as well. In this review, we address the psychosocial and ethical implications of cancer risk notification. The literature on the psychosocial impact of cancer screening programs and programs for notifying workers exposed to occupational carcinogens is reviewed critically. In addition, we examine new concerns and responsibilities raised by the emerging field of cancer genetics. Suggestions for future research and for patient education are addressed. 
Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. 
Are depressive symptoms nonspecific in patients with acute stroke? OBJECTIVE: Some investigators have suggested that major depression might be overdiagnosed in stroke patients because of changes in appetite, sleep, or sexual interest caused by their medical illness; others have suggested that depression may be underdiagnosed in stroke patients who deny symptoms of depression because of anosognosia, neglect, or aprosody. The authors' goal was to determine how frequently depressive symptoms occur in acute stroke patients with and without depressed mood to estimate how often diagnostic errors of inclusion or exclusion may be made. METHOD: They examined the rate of autonomic and psychological symptoms of depression in 205 patients who were consecutively hospitalized for acute stroke. Eighty-five (41%) of these patients had depressed mood, and 120 (59%) had no mood disturbance. Forty-six (54%) of the 85 patients with depressed mood (22% of all patients) were assigned the DSM-III diagnosis of major depression. RESULTS: The 120 patients without mood disturbance had a mean of one autonomic symptom, but the 85 patients with depressed mood had a mean of almost four. Tightening the diagnostic criteria to account for one more nonspecific autonomic symptom decreased the number of patients with major depression by only three; adding two more criteria decreased the number by only five. Thus, the rate of DSM-III major depression was 1% higher than the rate with one extra nonspecific autonomic symptom and 2% higher than the rate with two extra criteria. Conversely, loosening diagnostic criteria to account for denial of depressive illness increased the rate of major depression by only 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic and psychological depressive symptoms are strongly associated with depressed mood in acute stroke patients. 
Randomized comparative study of hemaccel vs. albumin infusion after total paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Fifty-four cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites were treated with one-session large-volume paracentesis and randomly assigned to two groups. The first group was infused with human albumin, and the second group was infused with hemaccel at doses with comparable oncotic power. The two groups were compared for incidence of complications, recurrence of massive ascites after hospital dismissal and survival rate. The incidence of complications traditionally related to paracentesis, the probability of requiring readmission to the hospital for ascites (p = 0.48) and the probability of survival after entry into the study (p = 0.85) were the same for the two groups. A multivariate analysis of 16 parameters, including treatment modality, identified absolute unresponsiveness to diuretics as the only independent predictor of mortality. These results indicate that hemaccel infusion may safely replace albumin infusion after total paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. 
A retrospective analysis of therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease: secondary treatment. We have reviewed results of secondary therapy in 427 patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who did not have a durable satisfactory response after primary treatment. At the beginning of secondary treatment, 320 patients (75%) had rash, 252 (59%) had liver dysfunction, and 228 (53%) had gut dysfunction. Secondary treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 249), cyclosporine (n = 80), antithymocyte globulin (n = 114), or monoclonal antibody (n = 19) either singly (n = 390) or in combination (n = 37). Parameters of GVHD severity were recorded weekly, and responses were determined according to values at the initiation of tertiary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of secondary treatment or the last recorded values before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or deterioration were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement or resolution of GVHD in the respective organ was seen in 45% of patients with skin disease, 25% of patients with evaluable liver disease, and in 35% of patients with evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 40% of patients. The highest complete response rate with secondary therapy (23%) was seen when GVHD recurred during the taper phase of primary glucocorticoid treatment and was managed by increasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient, disease, or treatment factors associated with likelihood of complete response or overall improvement. A similar analysis was performed to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of tertiary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). Severe dysfunction in the skin, liver, and gut at the beginning of treatment was associated both with a decreased likelihood of complete response and an increased treatment failure rate. The times to treatment failure and the proportions of patients in various response categories were similar for primary and secondary treatment, suggesting that the potential efficacy of new immunosuppressive agents for treatment of acute GVHD can be assessed meaningfully in patients who have not responded adequately to initial therapy. 
Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. 
Prognostic factors in esophageal squamous carcinoma. A study of histologic features, blood group expression, and DNA ploidy. The authors studied 69 squamous carcinomas of the middle or lower esophagus to evaluate prognostic factors. Clinical and histologic parameters that were evaluated included weight loss, esophageal obstruction at presentation, site, gross configuration, degree of tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, the status of resection margins, and stage. Blood group antigen (BGA) expression in the tumors was determined immunohistochemically and compared with blood type and antigen reactivity in adjacent normal mucosa. A loss of BGA expression was seen in 27 tumors. This finding was correlated with high stage but was not significantly linked to survival. DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissues. Forty-one of 52 tumors were aneuploid, and 14 had two or more separate aneuploid populations. However, survival was not correlated with ploidy status. The degree of differentiation and stage of the tumors were the only two independently significant prognostic indicators in this study. 
Coronary thrombosis in a patient with May-Hegglin anomaly. May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA) is a rare hereditary condition that is characterized by cytoplasmic inclusions in leukocytes and giant platelets. Many patients have some degree of thrombocytopenia. Most individuals with MHA are asymptomatic, but 25-43% of patients previously reported have had a hemorrhagic tendency. The authors describe a patient with MHA who had no history of hemorrhage but who developed complete coronary thrombosis after attempted angioplasty despite an apparent platelet count of 24,000 per mm3. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal bleeding time, normal platelet aggregation, and an increase in the size of approximately two-thirds of the platelets. The calculated platelet mass was near normal, which probably explains the thrombosis despite a decrease in platelet numbers. The authors conclude that in some patients with MHA platelets are functionally active both in vivo and in vitro. 
Negative regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter in embryonal carcinoma cells. Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes is negatively regulated in undifferentiated F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells via the conserved upstream regulatory region. This region contains constitutive enhancers and an inducible enhancer, the interferon consensus sequence (ICS), that is responsible for interferon-induced transcription. A series of mutations in the ICS, but not in the enhancer elements, resulted in an increase in expression of the MHC class I promoter in F9 cells. However, these ICS mutants did not increase promoter activity in F9 cells differentiated after retinoic acid treatment. Results of mobility-shift DNA-binding assays and methylation interference experiments showed that undifferentiated F9 cells contained a factor(s) that bound to a sequence within the 5' and central part of the ICS. This binding site, termed the MHC negative regulatory element (NRE), coincided with the site of mutations that increased promoter activity in F9 cells and was distinct from the element to which interferon-response factors bind. The factor(s) that binds to the MHC NRE was not detected in differentiated F9 cells treated with retinoic acid or in other cells expressing MHC class I genes. Finally, introduction of concatenated, double-stranded NRE oligomers, but not oligomers of unrelated sequences, into F9 cells abolished negative regulation of the MHC class I promoter activity, providing evidence that the NRE binding factor is responsible for repression of the MHC class I genes in F9 cells. 
Treatment with quinidine gluconate of persons with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection: discontinuation of parenteral quinine from CDC Drug Service. CDC has recently reviewed data on the reported incidence in the United States of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and has evaluated available information on the effective management of severe life-threatening infections. As a result of this review, CDC has concluded that the therapeutic drug of choice in the United States for persons with complicated P. falciparum infection is parenteral quinidine gluconate, and that stocking of parenteral quinine dihydrochloride for emergency distribution is no longer required to provide optimal management of P. falciparum infections. 
Digital artery embolization as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia of the brachial artery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia. 
A study of the status of clinical cancer research in the United States (1990). This study has confirmed a continuing decrease in the quality and quantity of young physicians entering academic careers in clinical oncology research, defined as cancer research requiring a clinician-patient interaction. Two major contributing factors were identified: the training programs and the research environment. The primary problems for the trainees were the financial insecurity of embarking on an academic career and the poor academic status of their role models in clinical cancer research. The problems regarding the environment of academic oncology and oncology research relate primarily to the strong and widespread perception that grant proposals for clinical oncology research are at a competitive disadvantage with proposals for cancer research in the laboratory. The study results yielded two basic recommendations. The first recommendation is to improve training for clinical cancer research and to implement unique funding mechanisms for trainees. Because physicians devote 3-10 years to clinical training, a minimum of 10 years of clinical research is needed for a clinician to compete effectively as a principal investigator in the R01 and P01 grant areas. The second recommendation is to develop peer review mechanisms that allow clinical research proposals to compete within a pool restricted to proposals in this category. The consensus in the study was that when programs in clinical research and laboratory research are in competition, the clinical proposals have a lower success rate. The problem appears to rest with the fact that the reviewers are frequently from disciplines other than clinical research and, more importantly, that clinical research proposals fare badly in competition against laboratory research proposals even when they are reviewed by appropriate peers. Implementation of this recommendation will require development of a clinical oncology research study section in the Division of Research Grants at the National Institutes of Health to review R01 grant proposals for innovative clinical cancer research, providing an academic environment that would enable the clinical investigator, through increased success in obtaining grants, to be a positive role model for the young physician/scientist. 
Incidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy. Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure. Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults. Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown. We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded. 
Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. A positive family history of autoimmune disease is common among patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, but usually autoimmunity is directed at organs other than the liver. We document for the first time the multiple occurrence of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. Out of a sibship of seven, three sisters developed this, one sister developed coeliac and autoimmune thyroid disease, one sister showed serological signs of autoimmunity, while the two brothers were well with no signs of autoimmunity. HLA typing showed that in association with the female sex DR3 seems to be more important than B8 in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, at least in this family. 
Immunocytochemical evidence of lymphocytic derivation of neoplastic cells in malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis is a rare disorder usually characterized by primarily cutaneous or neurological symptoms. Approximately 40 cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primary central nervous system (CNS) symptoms have been reported. Some investigators have postulated a hematopoietic origin for this neoplasm. Most of the literature, however, has perpetuated the idea that the often bizarre symptoms seen with this entity result from neoplastic endothelial cell proliferation within the small vessels of affected organs, including the brain and spinal cord. This report describes the immunohistochemical examination and confirmation of the cell of origin of this neoplasm based on five previously unpublished cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primarily CNS symptoms. It includes the first documentation of a T-cell lymphoma presenting as malignant angioendotheliomatosis. All cases include autopsy findings, and in four cases the diagnosis was made postmortem. One case was proven by stereotactic biopsy, but the patient succumbed as a result of severe intracranial bleeding that occurred at the time of biopsy. Tissues were studied with avidin-biotin peroxidase immunohistochemical techniques using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the leukocyte common antigen, LN-1, LN-2, and anti-Factor VIII, and also using Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. Based on the results obtained, the authors conclude that the proliferative cells seen within the vessel lumina are of lymphocytic origin and agree that the condition should more properly be designated intravascular lymphomatosis. The therapeutic implications of this conclusion point to the possible administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in an effort to achieve remissions in an otherwise relentlessly progressive neurological disorder. 
Reduction of high-grade slips (grades III-V) with VSP instrumentation. Report of a series of 41 cases. Records of 41 patients were reviewed for early complications resulting from reduction of high-grade spondylolisthesis. Blood loss averaged 1,427 ml. There were no cases of infection, dural tears, or bladder or bowel dysfunction. Two cases of transient foot drop and one case of permanent foot drop developed. A lumbar plexus stretch palsy occurred in one patient. Long-term results were evaluated in 20 patients followed up 2 or more years after surgery. Three of the 20 did not have interbody fusions and lost their reductions. All 20 patients went on to fuse with no pseudoarthrosis. One case of broken plate and two cases of broken screws occurred. Patient satisfaction ranged from good to excellent. Results suggest that reduction of high-grade slips with interbody fusion is a safe and effective procedure. 
Rabbit ear model of injury-induced arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Kinetics, reproducibility, and implications. Recently, considerable interest has focused on the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) response to injury, particularly as it relates to restenosis after angioplasty. In an effort to find an optimal experimental model of arterial SMC proliferation after injury, we examined the effects of external injury to the central artery of the rabbit ear and assessed the reproducibility, morphological changes, and time course of cellular proliferation after such an injury. With rabbits under general anesthesia, direct pressure was applied at two sites along the central artery of the ears of 19 New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbits were maintained on a diet of 2.4% fat and 0.001% cholesterol throughout the experiment. In seven rabbits examined after 21 days, marked SMC proliferation with neointimal formation was observed at all 28 sites (100%). Mean neointimal area, expressed as a percentage of the area of the tunica media, was 82 +/- 40% (range, 21-203%). Compared with the uninvolved artery displaced 2 mm from the injury site, mechanical crush caused a 38% increase in total vessel area (p less than 0.001), a 40% decrease in luminal area (p less than 0.002), and no change in the area of the media. Serial histological studies were performed 1-42 days after injury, using light and electron microscopy and bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry. Beginning at day 3, activated medial SMCs were noted to migrate through defects in the internal elastic membrane, with a gradual increase in neointimal area between days 5 and 12. Peak DNA synthesis was identified in the media 5 days after injury, with proliferative activity shifting almost exclusively to the neointima thereafter. 
Effect of Iraqi missile war on incidence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death in Israeli civilians. The Iraqi missile attack on Israel provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of fright due to a perceived threat of annihilation on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death among the civilian population. During the first days of the Gulf war we noted a sharp rise in the incidence of acute MI and sudden death in our area compared with five control periods. Patient population in the various study periods did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, hospital mortality, or proportion of patients in whom the acute event was the first presentation of coronary disease. However, during the first period of the war there were more cases of anterior wall MI and more patients received thrombolytic therapy than during control periods. Despite the continuing missile threat, the incidence of acute MI reverted to normal after the initial phase of the Gulf war. 
Glucagon and clonidine testing in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of glucagon stimulation and clonidine suppression tests in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in 113 hypertensive patients, 39 with and 74 without the tumor. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was sampled 2 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.28 mumol (1 mg) glucagon, and in the clonidine suppression test, blood was sampled 3 hours after administration of oral clonidine, 1.30 mumol (0.3 mg)/70 kg body wt. Baseline levels of catechols in antecubital venous blood were abnormal, with norepinephrine greater than 7.10 nmol/l (1,200 pg/m), epinephrine greater than 1.51 nmol/l (276 pg/ml), norepinephrine/dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) ratio greater than 1.09, or dopa greater than 35.53 nmol/l (7,000 pg/ml), in 30 of 39 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 77%) and 1 of 74 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 99%). Results of the glucagon test were abnormal (norepinephrine greater than 11.83 nmol/l [2,000 pg/ml] or more than threefold increase from baseline) in 25 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 81%) and 0 of 72 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 100%). Results of the clonidine test were abnormal (after clonidine norepinephrine greater than 2.96 nmol/l [500 pg/ml] or less than 50% decrease from baseline) in 29 of 30 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 97%) and in 7 of 30 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 67%). Very high baseline levels of catechols therefore indicated the presence of pheochromocytoma, but there were several false-negative results when normal levels were obtained. The glucagon test alone was highly specific but not sensitive, and the clonidine test was highly sensitive but less specific. 
Modified skin incisions for mastectomy: the need for plastic surgical input in preoperative planning. Skin-sparing mastectomy by definition describes the procedure of mastectomy, either simple or modified radical, with a minimum amount of skin excision. The surgical skin excision must: (1) include the nipple-areola complex, (2) include the biopsy site, and (3) allow for access to the axilla for possible dissection. In 27 mastectomies, the senior author has had direct input in the preoperative skin planning. All patients underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In large-breasted women, the mastectomy was performed to a Wise-type pattern. In small-breasted women, the mastectomy involved minimal skin excision followed by reconstruction. Non-continuous incisions were frequently used in small-breasted women, thereby minimizing breast scarring. When appropriately applied, skin-sparing mastectomy can greatly improve the final aesthetic result of the breast. 
Renal, hormonal, and hemodynamic effects of low-dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor in acute myocardial infarction. The effects of low-dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF; 3 pmol/kg/min; i.e., 10 ng/kg/min) were investigated in a single-blind, random-order, placebo-controlled study of 12 patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (MI). Compared with the placebo, ANF induced an increase in urine volume (p less than 0.05), sodium excretion (p less than 0.05), and chloride excretion (p less than 0.05). Urinary potassium and creatinine clearance were unchanged. The maximal response of urinary sodium excretion rate after ANF infusion was positively correlated with the basal sodium excretion rate (r = 0.579; p less than 0.05) and inversely correlated with basal plasma renin activity (r = -0.623; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) after infusion of ANF was significantly decreased compared with the basal level. The maximal change in PAC was closely correlated with the basal PAC (r = -0.857; p less than 0.01). However, no significant effect on hemodynamic variables was detected with infusion of ANF. Although additional studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of ANF infusion in acute MI, our observations suggest that low-dose infusion of the peptide is potentially valuable, as either sole or adjunctive therapy, for the management of water-sodium retention in acute MI. 
Controlled trial of Giardia lamblia: control strategies in day care centers. BACKGROUND: Strategies for control of Giardia lamblia in day care differ in numbers of children treated and in costs to parents and day care operators. The effectiveness of these strategies has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing three strategies for control of Giardia in infant-toddler day care centers: Group 1, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected children; Group 2, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection only; Group 3, exclusion and treatment of symptomatic infection, treatment of asymptomatic infection in the center. The study included 31 day care centers with 4180 child-months of observation. Giardia prevalence was determined before intervention and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months later; new infants and toddlers were tested on admission. RESULTS: Initial Giardia prevalences were 18% to 22% in the three groups. Giardia was identified in 10.5% of 676 new infants and toddlers entering study day care centers during the 6-month follow-up. Giardia prevalences by intervention group were 8%, 12%, and 7% at 1 month, and 7%, 8%, and 8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The stricter intervention resulted in greater cost in terms of child day care and parents' work days lost, but did not result in significantly better control of Giardia infections in this day care environment. 
Clinical evaluation of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation with magnetic resonance angiographic techniques. We evaluated the images of 60 carotid artery bifurcations in 31 patients suspected to have carotid artery disease who underwent invasive carotid angiography and combined two-dimensional, phase-sensitive and a gradient-echo magnetic resonance angiography. The phase scans consisted of seven serial projections that were obtained at 20 degrees intervals (11.0 minutes) around the carotid bifurcation; the gradient-echo (GRASS) scans were composed of 11 axial images (2.4 minutes) acquired through the bifurcation. The two magnetic resonance angiographic techniques yielded complementary pieces of information and were used together to compare magnetic resonance angiography with invasive angiography. Comparison of magnetic resonance and invasive angiograms of the 60 carotid arteries shows that the sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) of the magnetic resonance angiographic techniques we used to diagnose clinically significant carotid stenosis approach but do not reach those of invasive angiography. 
Fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of head and neck growths: is it necessary? The results of fine-needle aspiration cytology performed on 150 patients at the Geneva Clinic of Otolaryngology were analyzed. The accuracy rate was 80%. The study was nondiagnostic in 10% of the cases and falsely negative in another 10%. These results are similar to those in other centers. Nevertheless, several recent reports attest to the accuracy of fine-needle aspirations cytology, and in some clinics it is now part of the initial workup of every patient with a growth in the head and neck. On the basis of our own retrospective analysis, we believe fine-needle aspiration is a useful study only in patients with a previously treated malignancy and who have a new lump in the neck suspected to be a recurrence. 
Ossifying fibroma of the mid-face and paranasal sinuses: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Ossifying fibroma is benign, usually slow-growing tumor that may behave in an unpredictably aggressive fashion. Most of these unusual tumors affect the mandible. Their behavior in the mid-face and paranasal sinuses is not well documented. In our review of the subject, and of the cases presented, it appears that these lesions behave more aggressively than their mandibular counterparts. A more aggressive approach may be more beneficial than expectant observation or curettage in the initial management of this neoplasm. 
Nonfunctional mutants of the retinoblastoma protein are characterized by defects in phosphorylation, viral oncoprotein association, and nuclear tethering. We have examined the functional consequences of mutations present in defective alleles of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) isolated from two spontaneously arising tumors. Unlike cDNA clones expressing the wild-type protein p110Rb, those encoding the two mutant proteins failed to induce the appearance of senescent cells in transfected Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells. The mutant proteins were also defective in binding to the E1A oncoprotein, were unable to become hyperphosphorylated, and failed to become tightly associated with nuclear structures. We conclude that mutations in two distinct regions of the protein concomitantly affect these four aspects of p110Rb function. 
Effects of handrail support on claudication and hemodynamic responses to single-stage and progressive treadmill protocols in peripheral vascular occlusive disease. Because handrail support reduces the energy cost of treadmill walking, claudication and hemodynamic responses of patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease should also be affected. Furthermore, the reliability of the test results may be reduced unless the same pressure is applied to the handrails over repeated tests. The effect of handrail support on claudication and hemodynamic responses, and on their reliability, were examined during single-stage (2 mph, 12% grade) and progressive (2 mph, 0% grade with 2% increase every 2 minutes) treadmill protocols. Ten patients with stable disease performed both protocols 3 times, separated by 1 week, with and without handrail support. Claudication pain distance and maximal walking distance were greater (p less than 0.05) when handrail support was permitted, and they increased (p less than 0.05) over repeated tests of each protocol. No increase was noted over the tests without support. The responses and reliability of foot transcutaneous oxygen tension, ankle systolic pressure and ankle/brachial systolic pressure index after exercise to maximal tolerable pain were not affected by handrail support. Because claudication distances were altered, it is concluded that handrail support should not be allowed when assessing claudicants, unless balance cannot otherwise be maintained. 
Hepatitis C virus antibodies in acute icteric and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were measured in 213 patients who had acute (n = 122) and chronic (n = 91) non-A, non-B hepatitis. In acute infection, anti-hepatitis C virus was detected in 61% of IV drug abusers, in 33% of patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, and in 22% of patients with sporadic infections (P less than 0.0005, drug abusers vs. sporadic). Mean time to seroconversion was 11.6 weeks (range, 1-80 weeks). Anti-hepatitis C virus was more common in chronic infection (P less than 0.001) and was more often detected in IV drug users (89%; P less than 0.0001) and after transfusion (71%; P less than 0.005) compared with chronic sporadic infection (27%). Antibody persisted for up to 8 years. Six chronic case patients (8.3%) later lost antibody (mean, 24 months; range, 12-48 months). 
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in morbidly obese patients. Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients (13 men and 14 women) with body mass index greater than or equal to 40 kg m-2 were examined. The mean age of the subjects was 36.9 +/- 8.2 years (range 23-51 years), and the mean BMI was 50.2 +/- 6.2 kg m-2 (range 40.0-62.9 kg m-2). A whole-night sleep recording was made for all patients with signs or symptoms indicative of possible obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). If the first nocturnal sleep recording was abnormal, it was controlled after 1 year. Eleven (10 men and one woman) of the 27 patients had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of 10 h-1. They were symptomatic with excessive daytime sleepiness or other daytime symptoms of OSAS. The occurrence of OSAS in men and women was 76.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%. 
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: modes of presentation. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignancy among the southern Chinese people and has a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe in detail the presentation of NPC as found between 1984 and 1988 at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Our study confirmed that patients present with an advanced stage of malignancy; 70% were stage III to V. Eighty-two percent of patients were between 21 and 60 years of age. The symptoms often suggested benign disease and most patients would delay seeking treatment for at least 5 months. We recommend inspection of the nasopharynx with flexible nasoendoscopy for all persons in high-risk areas on a regular basis and advise a policy of active health education for both physicians and the general population to reduce the stage of NPC at first presentation. 
Intraarterial cisplatin in the management of stage IIB osteosarcoma in the pediatric and adolescent age group. Sixty patients with extremity osteosarcoma were treated with intraarterial cisplatin. This was followed by surgical resection (amputation or limb salvage) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy utilizing two different protocols. Seventy-five percent of patients achieved an initial response. Overall disease-free survival was 58%. The number of patients treated with limb-salvage surgery gradually increased to the extent that 80% of newly-registered patients achieved a response and were subjected to limb salvage. Disease-free survival was 48% in amputation and 68% in limb salvage. The only factors found to have prognostic significance in determining disease-free survival were extent of tumor destruction induced by preoperative chemotherapy and tumor size. 
Incidence of ovarian cyst formation in women taking ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms. A total of 7,759 women were treated with ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms (EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms) in a field study involving 983 obstetrician-gynecologists evaluating the incidence of ovarian cyst formation. Six thousand three hundred eighty-two patients were evaluable; 1,377 could not be evaluated because of failure to meet inclusion criteria or inconsistent or incomplete data collection. Cysts were detected in 80 patients at the time of the final visit. Follow-up questionnaires were received on 61% of patients and confirmed the presence of 12 newly formed ovarian cysts in patients taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms. Only three women required an operation for ovarian cysts; two women had functional ovarian cysts (one follicular and one luteal), and one had a neoplastic cyst (cystadenoma). Thus, the incidence of ovarian cyst formation requiring surgical intervention was 0.05% in women taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms. 
Early experience with mitral valve reconstruction for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement. From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital. Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated. Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery. Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients. Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%). Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge. Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients. Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients. Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair. Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation. Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable. Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic. There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation. Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results. Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified. 
CO2 laser-induced pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials in peripheral neuropathies: correlation between electrophysiological and histopathological findings. Pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials (pain SEPs) following CO2 laser stimulation as well as conventional electrically stimulated SEPs (electric SEPs) were examined in 10 patients with peripheral neuropathies in whom the histopathological examination of the sural nerve was done. Results of pain SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of pain sensation and densities of small myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. In contrast, results of electric SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of deep and tactile sensations and with densities of large myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. Therefore, pain SEPs are considered to be generated by ascending signals mediated through nociceptive receptors and A delta fibers. The pain SEP is only one noninvasive and objective method currently available to investigate a physiological condition of the sensory pathway responsible for pain sense, and is especially useful when combined with the conventional electric SEPs. 
Secretagogue response of azaserine-induced rat pancreatic acinar tumors in vivo. This study investigates digestive and lysosomal enzyme secretion of azaserine-induced pancreatic acinar carcinomas in response to cholecystokinin in rats. After 15-20 months of treatment, 95% of the animals developed pancreatic acinar carcinomas encompassing more than 90% of the tissue. In anesthetized rats basal trypsin output was significantly elevated in the tumor group despite diminished fluid secretion. There was a linear correlation between tumor size and basal amylase and trypsin secretion. Intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin (25 IDU.kg-1.h-1) induced a significantly lower secretion of fluid per gram pancreas, as well as decreased amylase and trypsin output, in the tumor group compared with the control group. Plasma amylase and lipase levels were significantly elevated in the tumor group under both basal and stimulated conditions. The output of the lysosomal enzymes beta-D-glucuronidase and alpha-D-glucosidase was significantly increased in the tumor group under background secretin infusion. Additional cholecystokinin infusion caused a sharp increase in glucuronidase output in this group with only minimal increase in controls. Glucosidase output increased similarly in both groups. Amylase, lipase, and trypsin tumor tissue concentrations were markedly reduced by 85%, 90%, and 87%, respectively. It was concluded that the decreased secretory response of digestive enzymes may result from decreased synthesis, lowered storage capabilities, and/or a decreased/increased responsiveness to cholecystokinin. Increased glucuronidase secretion may reflect an augmented cell turnover of malignant tissue. 
Pattern of simulated snoring is different through mouth and nose. Cineradiography of the pharynx during simulated snoring was done in 6 healthy volunteers, and supraglottic pressure and flow rate were recorded in 12 others. We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls. The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth. During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations. Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate. Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz). This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring. At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring. 
Pharmacodynamic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 milligrams/kilogram/day) given once daily or in three divided doses to cancer patients with urinary tract infection. The pharmacologic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 mg/kg/day) given once daily (qd) or thrice daily (tid) for the treatment of urinary tract infections were studied in a randomized prospective study of 60 cancer patients. The overall efficacy was 96%. Nephrotoxicity, assessed by the measure of urinary excretion of phospholipids, was lower for the patients receiving the qd regimen than for those receiving the tid regimen. Elevation of serum creatinine (20% over baseline) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and in three receiving the tid regimen. Cochleotoxicity, assessed by pure-tone audiometry (250 to 18,000 Hz) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and none receiving the tid regimen. Concentrations in sera were measured on days 1 and 5. No significant accumulation was observed in either group. Median serum bactericidal titers, expressed as reciprocal values (percentage of the sera with a titer greater than or equal to 8), were measured against 25 test organisms in samples collected 6 h after the administration of netilmicin and were, for the qd group, 16 (82%) against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (8%) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the tid group, 4 (57%) against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (0%) against P. aeruginosa. The rate of killing in serum was rapid (2 to 3 log in 2 h against P. aeruginosa; 3 to 5 log in 2 h against members of the Enterobacteriaceae) and correlated with the sampling time and hence the concentration in serum of netilmicin. The duration of the postantibiotic effect in serum depended also on the strain and the sampling time of the serum. 
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase is a peroxisomal enzyme in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. The intracellular localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) has been examined by immunofluorescence using four monoclonal anti-Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase antibodies raised against a recombinant human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase derivative produced and purified from Escherichia coli. Colocalization with catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was used to demonstrate the peroxisomal localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. In the fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome patients, the enzyme is not transported to the peroxisomal ghosts but, like catalase, remains in the cytoplasm. In addition, immunocryoelectron microscopy of yeast cells expressing human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase showed that the enzyme is translocated to the peroxisomes. 
Factors affecting the measurement of cholesterol nucleation in human gallbladder and duodenal bile. The study of cholesterol gallstone disease would be facilitated if the nucleation time of cholesterol crystals could be measured in duodenal bile and was correlated with nucleation occurring in vivo. Therefore, our aims were to determine (a) if nucleation time could be measured in duodenal bile, (b) the effect of bacteria, phospholipase, protease, and dilution on the measurement of nucleation time, and (c) the ability of nucleation time of duodenal bile to reflect changes occurring in vivo that promote the formation of gallstones and, therefore, the potential usefulness of nucleation time in predicting and studying the formation of gallstones. Gallbladder bile was obtained from 27 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy and 19 patients undergoing diagnostic duodenal biliary drainage. Among the 14 bile samples collected by drainage that nucleated within 21 days, mean nucleation time was 6.3 +/- 2.8 days. The addition of inhibitors of phospholipase or protease prolonged nucleation time slightly. Bacteria were cultured from one bile sample at the time of collection and five samples at the time of nucleation. The addition of antibiotics had no effect on nucleation time. Dilution of bile collected at cholecystectomy to the concentration of duodenal bile prolonged nucleation time. In 4 of 5 obese patients receiving a very low calorie diet and predisposed to gallstones, the nucleation time in duodenal bile shortened, and the shortest nucleation times were associated with the formation of cholesterol crystals in vivo. Thus, measurement of nucleation time in duodenal bile may be useful in predicting and studying the formation of cholesterol gallstones. 
Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome of the scalp: histologic and ultrastructural findings. Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is an association of connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis that usually appears in the first decades of life. The nevi occur on the trunk and extremities. In a 48-year-old man with this rare syndrome the connective tissue nevus was located on the scalp and was pruritic. Histologically, involvement of the epidermis with cystic dilatation of the hair follicles and an abnormality of mucopolysaccharides were present. The nevi in this syndrome may involve an alteration in the three components of connective tissue to a variable degree. 
Vascular reactivity after balloon angioplasty in an atherosclerotic rabbit. Alterations in vessel wall reactivity (VR) at or adjacent to the dilation site after balloon angioplasty (BA) may vary according to the inflation protocol and the time after angioplasty and may influence outcome. In 64 atherosclerotic rabbit femoral arteries, we evaluated VR after BA with intravenous ergonovine (ERGO) (40 micrograms/min for 5 minutes) and intra-arterial nitroglycerin (NTG) (2,500 micrograms single bolus) 24-72 hours and 28 days after BA. Comparisons were made with atherosclerotic, nonangioplastied, age-matched controls. BA was standardized to three 1-minute inflations, each 1 minute apart. For each balloon size, 2.5- (appropriate size) or 3.0-mm (oversized) vessels were allocated to either 5 or 10 atm inflation pressure. For the analysis, four groups were compared: Group 1, 3.0/5; group 2, 3.0/10; group 3, 2.5/5, and group 4, 2.5 mm/10 atm. Angiographic diameters were measured at, proximal, and distal to the lesion at baseline, 10 minutes after ERGO, and 5 minutes after NTG. Angiograms were measured with electronic calipers by two blinded observers. All segments of control vessels vasoconstricted to ERGO and vasodilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. At 24-72 hours after dilatation, the angioplasty sites for all inflation pressure/balloon size combinations were not responsive to either ERGO or NTG. All segments distal to the dilatation sites vasoconstricted to ERGO and dilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. Proximal segments of vessels dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriate size) responded positively to both stimuli (p less than 0.05). Those vessels dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) were nonreactive in the segment proximal to the angioplasty site. Twenty-eight days later angioplasty sites dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriately sized) regained reactivity; however, segments dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) remained unresponsive. All proximal segments, including those from vessels dilated with a large balloon, reacted positively. All distal segments reacted appropriately. Restenosis rates were not different between the over- and appropriately sized balloon groups. These data demonstrate that immediately after angioplasty, vessels lose reactivity at the dilatation site. Those vessels dilated with the smaller-size balloon (2.5 mm) regained reactivity. For large balloons, reactivity is not regained at 28 days. For segments proximal to the site of dilatation, transient loss of reactivity is seen only when a large balloon is used. Thus, acute closure originating at the site of dilatation is not a result of spasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Flecainide acetate treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: dose-response studies. The Flecainide Supraventricular Tachycardia Study Group. The dose-response relations for efficacy and tolerance of the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide acetate were studied in 28 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Group 1) and 45 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (Group 2). Recurrent symptomatic tachycardia was documented with use of transtelephonic electrocardiographic recording. Patients received flecainide in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg twice daily and placebo for 1 month treatment periods. Among 14 patients in Group 1 who qualified for efficacy analysis, 4 (29%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 12 (86%) of 14 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Among 28 patients in Group 2, 2 (7%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia also increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 17 (61%) of 28 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Noncardiac adverse experiences were the leading cause of premature study discontinuation during flecainide treatment periods (five patients in Group 1 and six patients in Group 2). 
Cell type-dependent effect of phospholipid and cholesterol on bile salt cytotoxicity. The effect of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol on bile salt-induced cytotoxicity was investigated. Experiments were performed in both human erythrocytes and cultured CaCo-2 cells, a model system for gastrointestinal epithelium. Hemolysis induced by 50 mmol/L sodium-taurocholate was reduced by both lecithin and cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Cholesterol was 10 times more effective than phosphatidylcholine. Addition of only small amounts of the sterol to phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions eliminated all cytotoxicity. The protective influence of cholesterol is probably mediated through a direct effect on the membrane. Incubation of erythrocytes with a cholesterol/taurocholate mixture greatly increased the cholesterol content of the membrane. With respect to sensitivity to bile salts and the protective effect of lecithin, CaCo-2 cells behaved very similar to erythrocytes. However, cholesterol failed to have any cytoprotective effect when used in combination with taurocholate or phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions. Interestingly, at relatively high concentrations of cholesterol (cholesterol saturation index greater than 1.0), the sterol even increased cytotoxicity. This correlated with a cholesterol-induced shift of phosphatidylcholine from micelles to vesicles, which normally occurs in supersaturated model and human bile. The different sensitivity of the two cell types to the effect of cholesterol on bile salt damage might be caused by the difference in lipid membrane composition. In conclusion, CaCo-2 cells represent a physiologically more relevant model system to study bile cytotoxicity than erythrocytes. When extrapolated to gallbladder epithelial cells, these results could be relevant for the pathogenesis of gallstone disease. The increased cytotoxicity might be the signal by means of which supersaturated bile induces mucin hypersecretion by gallbladder epithelial cells. 
Role of the sarcolemma in triggered propagated contractions in rat cardiac trabeculae. We have recently described that after contractions propagate through multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. These propagating contractions are triggered in damaged regions of rat right ventricular trabeculae during relaxation of electrically stimulated twitches. Propagation of triggered contractions has been attributed to calcium ions that diffuse along the preparation, causing calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in adjacent cells. In the present study we have investigated a possible role of the sarcolemma and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in the initiation and propagation of triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) in multicellular preparations. We studied whether 1) TPCs are accompanied by delayed sarcolemmal depolarizations, 2) such depolarizations mediate local contraction, and 3) an intact sarcolemma is required for propagation of contractions. TPCs that remained stable for prolonged periods of time could be induced by trains of 15 stimuli (2 Hz, 15-second intervals) at lowered temperature (19-21 degrees C) of the superfusing Krebs-Henseleit medium and a [Ca(2+)]o of 1.0-1.5 mM. Although TPCs could be induced at 38 degrees C and a [Ca2+]o of 3.0-4.0 mM, they disappeared within 10 minutes. Force was measured with a silicon strain gauge; length and shortening of sarcomeres were measured at two sites of the muscle using laser diffraction techniques. Membrane potential was measured with flexible microelectrodes. Saponin was used to selectively render the sarcolemma permeable to small ions and molecules. Propagation velocity of TPCs in intact trabeculae varied from 1.7 to 13.4 mm/sec at 19-21 degrees C. TPCs were accompanied by DADs that could reach threshold and induce triggered arrhythmias. Changes in latency, duration, and force of TPCs, induced by changing [Ca(2+)]o or the number of conditioning stimuli, were closely matched by changes in latency, duration, and amplitude of DADs; DADs consistently preceded TPCs, on average by 60 msec. Local heating of the muscle, by applying a current through an insulated platinum wire (diameter 100 microns) that touched the muscle, interrupted propagation of TPCs reversibly. DADs were, in the absence of a local contraction, still recorded distal to the heated site. In muscles that were treated with saponin and exposed to solutions approximating the intracellular milieu, spontaneously occurring local contractions that propagated in both directions (at velocities of 70-200 microns/sec) were elicited at a bathing calcium concentration of approximately 0.6 microM. Below this threshold, propagated contractions could be triggered by pressure ejection of a calcium-containing solution from a microelectrode positioned close to the trabecula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Scheduling of revaccination against hepatitis B virus Studies have shown that to maintain protection against infection after a primary course of hepatitis B immunisation, revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs) titre obtained 1 month after the booster dose. However, schemes which require post-booster testing may present practical difficulties. We applied a random-effects regression model to data from 118 Senegalese infants given three injections of hepatitis B vaccine about 6 weeks apart and a booster injection at 13 months, and show that revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-HBs titre recorded at the time of the booster dose. We also show that titre-at-booster is no less accurate in predicting future titre than 1-month post-booster titre. In several other studies the post-booster decline in anti-HBs conforms to the same mathematical description, indicating the generality of our findings. 
Effect of antireceptor antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy on the cycling of cardiac beta receptors. A substantial proportion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have circulating autoantibodies directed against the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. These antireceptor antibodies inhibit both ligand binding to membrane beta-receptors and isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase. The functional consequences of antibody-receptor interactions were further studied by examining their influence on beta-adrenoceptor cycling. Sera from eight patients with cardiomyopathy induced a loss of beta-receptors from the surface of cardiac myocytes consistent with internalization. This loss was inhibited by concanavalin A, suggesting that receptor sequestration preceded internalization but was unaffected by the cytoskeleton inhibitors colchicine and cytochalasin. In cell-free preparations, serum-induced desensitization of beta-receptors was prevented by heparin but not the inhibitor of protein kinase A; this is consistent with a requirement for receptor phosphorylation by the beta-receptor kinase. In contrast to isoproterenol-mediated endocytosis, beta-receptors internalized under the influence of cardiomyopathic sera do not recycle to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that antireceptor antibodies in human dilated cardiomyopathy induced downregulation by interfering at several steps in the cycling of beta-receptors. These effects would contribute to the reported decline in beta-receptor responsiveness in cardiomyopathic myocardium. 
Preliminary results in invasive bladder cancer with transurethral resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and combined pelvic irradiation plus cisplatin chemotherapy. Preliminary data are presented of a clinically feasible pilot study to select a significant subgroup of patients among those with muscle-invading bladder tumors for local cure and bladder preservation, while also to offer all patients the possibility of preventing the development of distant metastases. Transurethral debulking surgical resection was combined with neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy plus 2 additional courses of cisplatin and 4,000 cGy. If tumor was found on cystoscopic re-evaluation by biopsy and for cytology after cisplatin and partial irradiation (4,000 cGy.) immediate cystectomy was advised. If tumor was not found consolidation by a radiotherapy boost to a total of 6,480 cGy. plus 1 additional course of cisplatin was given. Of 53 consecutive patients the planned treatment was completed in 42 (79%). With a median followup of 26 months (range 15 to 42 months), 72% of all entered patients were alive, 70% have not required cystectomy and 74% have not had distant metastases. Among the 42 patients who completed the planned protocol chemotherapy dose reductions were required in 39% for stomatitis, bone marrow depression and/or renal dysfunction. There were 2 serious complications but no treatment-related sepsis, deaths or significant renal dysfunction. Eight patients underwent immediate radical cystectomy because of positive biopsy and/or cytology results after 4,000 cGy., while 34 completed full chemotherapy and radiotherapy without any significant bladder or bowel injury. Of 42 patients 22 (52%) have maintained the bladder without any recurrence, and of those selected for full chemotherapy and radiotherapy this number increased to 65%. To date 12 patients have persistent or recurrent bladder tumors: 5 (15%) had invasive tumors treated by cystectomy and 7 (21%) had carcinoma in situ treated by intravesical therapy. The true success of this or other selective bladder-preserving treatments will require 3 to 5 years of followup to be confident that such treatment has sterilized the bladder of cancer. This feasibility study has been clinically practical, modestly well tolerated and encouraging for the significant proportion of patients with a sustained complete response and for the 70% over-all survival rate at 2 years. To evaluate critically the efficacy of methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy in the prevention of occult distant micrometastases and in increasing the rate of successful bladder preservation, in May 1988 we began a randomized phase 3 trial with and without neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy. 
The effect of steroid therapy on recovery from tonsillectomy in children. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study to determine the postoperative effects of steroids in tonsillectomy was performed on 25 children from 4 to 12 years of age. A single intravenous dose of dexamethasone or a placebo was administered at onset of surgery. Other preoperative and postoperative medications, including antibiotics, anesthesia, and surgical techniques were standardized as noted in this article. The ability to return to a full or semifull diet occurred on the third and fourth postoperative days, significantly sooner in the steroid-treated patients than in the control patients. By the fifth and sixth days, the control group were eating as well as those children who received steroids. No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, nausea, emesis, fever, or in the need for postoperative pain medications. This preliminary article concludes that a single preoperative dose of steroid results in an earlier return to a normal (full) diet in children who had undergone tonsillectomy. 
Radical prostatectomy for localized prostatic carcinoma in the renal transplant patient. Three renal transplant patients had prostatic carcinoma after transurethral prostatectomy at 2 weeks, 2 months and 12 years following transplantation. One patient had stage A1 disease, while 2 had stage A2 prostatic carcinoma. All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. All patients had residual cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimen but none had nodal or capsular involvement. The surgical technique and rationale for management are discussed. 
Angioedema: manifestations and management. Angioedema is characterized by localized swelling of sudden onset affecting the skin and/or mucous membranes. It can be classified into hereditary and acquired forms. Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. Acute attacks are life threatening and cannot be managed by antihistamines, corticosteroids, or adrenergic drugs. Prophylactic therapy is possible with danazol or stanozolol. Acquired angioedema includes nonhereditary C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency; idiopathic, allergic, and drug-induced forms; angioedema associated with lupus erythematosus and hypereosinophilia; and angioedema caused by physical stimuli. Treatment of these forms of angioedema depends on identifying and avoiding the cause, induction of tolerance, or symptomatic treatment with systemic antihistamines. 
Altered inotropic responses in diabetic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy. To understand the mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the consequences of combined hypertension and diabetes, cardiac tissue responses to various inotropic agents were measured in experimental diabetes. Streptozotocin was injected into Wistar rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Six weeks after the injection diabetic rats showed a subsensitivity to beta adrenergic stimulation in ventricular tissue and a supersensitivity and hyper-responsiveness to Ca++ and alpha adrenergic stimulation (except in WKYs) in ventricular tissues and left atria. A supersensitivity to BAY K 8644 in SHR left atria and a hyper-responsiveness to verapamil in ventricular strips were also noted. These alterations may be due to a change in receptor number or to postreceptor alterations. Diabetic SHRs exhibited greater changes in several of the drug responses (responses to isoproterenol, phenylephrine and BAK 8644) were more hyperlipidemic and had a high mortality as compared with Wistar rats and WKY diabetics. These findings confirm that the combination of hypertension and diabetes results in greater cardiac pathology than is seen with either disease alone. 
Isotopic study of the effects of platelets on development of intimal thickening in autologous vein grafts in dogs. The effects of platelets on the development of intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts was investigated using canine poor run-off models. A new apparatus consisting of a shielding lead block to measure in vivo platelet adherence only on the intima of the vein graft was developed. In 23 dogs, 51Cr-labelled platelets (20 microCi/kg) were injected and isotope emission over the grafts was counted. Platelet adherence was expressed as the thrombocyte accumulation index (TAI), i.e. the ratio of counts over the graft under an abnormal flow condition in the poor run-off model to those over the graft under normal flow conditions of the contralateral leg. The TAI of the total graft (TTAI) was significantly high immediately and on the first and third days after implantation. The TAIs of the proximal (PTAI) and distal (DTAI) portions of the vein graft were also high at these same times. At 7, 10, 14 and 21 days, the TAI was almost equal to 1.0, a time at which endothelial regeneration was complete as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the prominent intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts in dogs, induced under an abnormal flow condition, correlates well with the enhanced platelet adherence on the intima of the vein grafts in an early period after implantation. 
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatous transformation: an autopsy case. We report an adult case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with remarkable sarcomatous changes. At autopsy a yellowish-white tumor (8 x 6 cm) was found in the left hepatic lobe, and there were several daughter nodules in both hepatic lobes. Histologically, most of the main tumor, and all of the daughter nodules examined, showed sarcomatous changes (spindle- or fusiform-shaped and pleomorphic cells). Histologic examination of a whole slice of the main tumor disclosed a focus of adenosquamous carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) within the tumor. Frequent transitions between adenosquamous carcinoma areas and sarcomatous areas suggested that sarcomatous transformation occurred in cholangiocarcinoma and then grew to spread rapidly. Immunohistochemically, squamous carcinoma and, to a lesser degree, adenocarcinoma elements were strongly positive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, both being also weakly positive in sarcomatous cells, supporting that possibility. Vimentin was positive only in sarcomatous elements. Cholangiocarcinoma should be included in the list of hepatic tumors showing sarcomatous change. 
Extracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The classic prototypes of the gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes are familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome. Extracolonic manifestations have been described in both diseases, and the distinction between them has become less clear. In fact, some authorities have suggested that familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome may represent a spectrum of the same disease. In both conditions, extracolonic expressions are the rule rather than the exception, and familiarity with them is essential for accurate diagnosis and correct patient management. In this pictorial essay, we discuss familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome together under the heading familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The colonic characteristics of these syndromes will be reviewed briefly, followed by examples of the most common extracolonic manifestations. 
Interleukin-2 toxicity. Because of the ability of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to support the proliferation and activation of numerous types of immunocompetent cells and to support the survival of adoptively transferred lymphocytes, there has been considerable interest in its use in the immunotherapy of malignancies. While studies to date have indicated that IL-2 has activity against some malignancies, considerable toxicity has also been observed. Careful prescreening and selection of patients and appropriate management of toxicity can minimize adverse outcomes. Studies of IL-2 effects have provided intriguing evidence of interactions of the immune/cytokine system with the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and other systems. Studies in animal models have demonstrated the central role of an intact immune system in mediating many toxicities of IL-2. Several adverse effects of IL-2 appear to be mediated by other cytokines whose production is induced by IL-2. Studies into the pathogenesis and manifestations of IL-2 toxicity have offered the hope of developing less toxic approaches to IL-2 therapy. Several lessons from the IL-2 experience are likely to be applicable in the clinical development of other cytokines. 
Cognitive neuropsychology. Resolving enigmas about Wernicke's aphasia and other higher cortical disorders. Cognitive neuropsychology is a young branch of neuroscience whose ancestral influences include a rich pool of experimental (eg, cognitive, psychology), theoretical (eg, epistemology), and clinical (eg, neurology, neuropsychology) disciplines. An essential principle of cognitive neuropsychology is that disorders of higher cortical functions can be understood in terms of breakdowns of one or more information-processing modules. Each module is the most basic element of intelligence that can be defined based on current knowledge. This approach is a refinement of-not a fundamental departure from-the 19th-century "localizationist" view of language disorders. Wernicke's aphasia, for example, classical attributed to a single cognitive deficit (loss of word sounds), is shown in this review to require damage to multiple distinct information-processing modules. Cognitive neuropsychology provides the tools for the type of fine-grained analyses of behavior that are needed to capitalize on recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, including the development of more sophisticated models of brain-behavior relationships. 
Reconstruction of the lower lip and chin with the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap. Four cases of total lip and chin reconstruction are presented. In three, the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap was used for reconstruction. In the fourth case, the palmaris longus was separated from the flap but still used as a lower lip sling. In all cases, the entire lower lip and the soft tissue of the chin were reconstructed in one stage. All patients healed primarily, and the three who underwent radiotherapy tolerated it without complications. Lip seal and speech were good, and there was no problem with drooling. Postoperative results emphasize the importance of respecting the aesthetic unit of the lower lip and chin. 
Comparison of an antiinflammatory dose of ibuprofen, an analgesic dose of ibuprofen, and acetaminophen in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee BACKGROUND. The optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis. RESULTS. Seventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS. In short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose. 
Lectin staining of neoplastic and normal background colorectal mucosa in nonpolyposis and polyposis patients. A lectin histochemistry approach was adopted for comparative assessment of a colon cancer risk. Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-II (GSA-II), and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) was investigated in tumor and background tissue from a total of 34 adenoma and 44 cancer patients and compared with reaction patterns in control and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Adenoma patients with UEA-I positive rectal mucosa were found to have a 33.3 percent familial history of large bowel cancer, which was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the respective 4.0 percent figure for patients with negative rectal mucosa. In the cancer patients, an even stronger correlation was noted, with a 63.2 percent UEA-I positive family history association being recorded, as opposed to 4.0 percent in the negative rectal mucosa patients (P less than 0.01). Thus, the results suggest that, apparently, normal rectal background mucosa of individuals genetically at high risk for colon and rectal cancer demonstrates a specific lectin binding ability similar to that of FAP patients and that the simple method using UEA-I staining of rectal biopsy specimens can be of practical use in identification of high-risk colorectal cancer. 
Osmotic diarrhea induced by sugar-free theophylline solution in critically ill patients. It is widely accepted that early enteral nutrition is beneficial to critically ill patients. Diarrhea is a common problem in this setting and is often erroneously ascribed to enteral feedings. More often medications cause the diarrhea. Multiple cases of severe diarrhea associated with the use of a sugar-free theophylline solution (SFTS) were discovered by a nutrition support team. SFTS may induce an osmotic diarrhea because it contains sorbitol. A 55-year-old man admitted for a dissecting aneurysm was started on isotonic formula enteral feedings and within a day of starting SFTS developed severe diarrhea. The sorbitol-induced osmotic diarrhea persisted for 36 of his 83 days of hospitalization with direct cost for the evaluation of this diarrhea being $4,250. His prolonged hospitalization cost $166,200. A retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients receiving SFTS revealed that 15 patients had diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days compared with 20 patients receiving iv aminophylline, of whom only two patients had diarrhea. Furthermore, SFTS was administered to healthy volunteers and a prominent breath hydrogen response was noted. The polyalcohol sorbitol is used as a sweetner in "sugar-free" products and not quantified on labeling because it is considered an inactive ingredient. Nutritionists should be aware that medicinal solutions can contain enough sorbitol to create a laxative effect which is an easily reversible cause of diarrhea in enterally fed patients. 
Treating the progressive stages of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease affects thousands of Americans, men and women equally and apparently with little regard to race. Its diagnosis depends largely on repeated clinical observations of representative signs, such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances. Patients progress through stages: Early disease involves only one limb or side and confers minimal disability, but advanced disease restricts patients to full care. Treatment is chosen on the basis of disease stage and patient response. Combination carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is appropriate for any significant degree of disability, and other antiparkinsonian drugs and anticholinergic agents may be used as adjuncts. Electroconvulsive therapy, use of selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl), and surgery are still undergoing investigation but may hold promise. 
Travel medicine and travel clinics. In response to the vast number of American travelers to the developing world, the discipline of Travel Medicine has become an emerging specialty. There are presently no formal Board or other requirements to practice Travel Medicine, but bona fide practitioners of this field, who also usually direct travel clinics, should at the least be well-trained and experienced in tropical medicine and medical aspects of travel, and have had considerable overseas work experience. The concept of travel medicine and the need for travel clinics operated by well-qualified physicians are discussed. The areas of involvement of travel clinics in protecting the health of the traveler are described. 
Quantification of cell kinetic characteristics using flow cytometric measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid and bromodeoxyuridine for bladder cancer. A total of 56 human bladder tumors that were histologically proved to be transitional cell carcinoma was analyzed by simultaneous flow cytometric 2-color measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and bromodeoxyuridine. Bromodeoxyuridine in vitro labeling was performed by sample incubation with bromodeoxyuridine under high atmospheric pressure oxygen. Grade 1 tumors showed 33.3% aneuploidy with a mean bromodeoxyuridine positive stained ratio (labeling index) of 5.1 +/- 3.4%. Grade 2 tumors featured 51.7% aneuploidy with a mean labeling index of 8.9 +/- 7.7%. On the other hand, a markedly increased labeling index of 15.2 +/- 8.2% with aneuploidy was observed in all but 1 grade 3 tumors. When DNA ploidy and labeling indexes were compared according to the presence or absence of muscular invasion of tumors, all 16 muscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 18.7 +/- 8.0%), while 17 of 40 nonmuscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 8.6 +/- 5.4%). This labeling index difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that bromodeoxyuridine/DNA 2-color flow cytometry may provide an objective parameter for quantification of the malignant potential of bladder cancers. 
Body surface isopotential mapping of the entire QRST complex in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Correlation with the location of the accessory pathway. Body surface potential maps were recorded during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing at the time of electrophysiologic studies in 42 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The locations of the accessory pathways were determined by epicardial mapping during surgery in 34 patients and by multicatheter endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in eight additional patients. During delta wave inscription, the shape and extension of areas of the negative and positive potentials on the thorax correlated better with the preexcitation site (69% of patients) than with the localization of the minimum potential alone (45.2% of patients). Typical potential distributions were present from the beginning of the delta wave and remained stationary during the first half of the QRS complex. During marked preexcitation, the superposition of atrial activity on the delta wave produced a mixed pattern in the earliest maps. However, these alterations of early delta thoracic potential distribution did not persist longer than 30 msec. The spread of the negative potentials during the last half of the QRS complex also characterized each localization: right-sided preexcitation reproduced the depolarization sequence of left bundle branch block, left-sided preexcitation reproduced that of right bundle branch block, and posterior pathways resembled left anterior fascicular block. Anterior left ventricular and more anterior left lateral ventricular preexcitations mimicked a right bundle branch block-left posterior fascicular block pattern. There was good correlation between the body surface potential map obtained during the ST segment and the site of the right-sided preexcitation. However, in left-sided preexcitations, ST patterns concordant with delta wave patterns were found less frequently than in right-sided preexcitations. 
Subcapsular hepatic necrosis in liver transplantation: CT appearance. Eleven cases of subcapsular hepatic necrosis were found in 47 hepatic transplantation patients who underwent CT examination between the second and 14th postoperative day. CT examinations of all 11 cases showed nonenhancing hypodense subcapsular areas with irregular contours in the liver. Major vessels were free of obstruction. Anatomic correlation, possible in one case, confirmed the diagnosis. Size disproportion between the graft and the recipient abdominal cavity reduced hepatic blood flow and caused abnormal pressure points. One or both of these factors could result in ischemia in subcapsular areas and explain the subcapsular necrosis. Although it has good prognosis without treatment, subcapsular hepatic necrosis is important to recognize to avoid confusion with liver necrosis after vascular thrombosis. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders. Ultrasonographic examination is being used with progressively greater frequency as an aid in diagnosis of gynecologic disorders but too often without consideration of whether information other than that obtained from clinical examination is needed and whether ultrasonography can supply it. The size, number, and position of pelvic masses and, in some instances, the type of tumor can be identified, but it is not often necessary when operation is clearly indicated. Ultrasonographic screening for diseases of the reproductive organs has been proposed, but its use for this purpose is limited and it is not cost-effective. It should be used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis, not as a primary diagnostic procedure. 
Use of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity. Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it. The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery. Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13). The various recorded parameters are discussed, and it is concluded that the patients with a closed mastoid cavity can tolerate a hearing aid in the operated ear at least as well as the control subjects with no ear surgery. 
Physician recommendations for screening mammography: results of a survey using clinical vignettes BACKGROUND. Although experts estimate that 30% of breast cancer deaths could be prevented if women were screened according to published guidelines, fewer than 50% of physicians follow screening mammography guidelines, and fewer than 30% of women are screened with mammography. METHODS. Physician recommendations for screening mammography were examined in a questionnaire mailed to 300 randomly selected physicians of the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians. Physicians responded with their likelihood of recommending screening mammography to 24 clinical vignettes that high-lighted patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics. RESULTS. Seventy-one percent responded. Ninety-one percent reported almost always recommending screening mammography to a 55-year-old woman at her yearly examination. They were significantly less likely to recommend mammography to women who were young (40 years old), were old (70 years old), were poor, had small breasts, had painful mammograms, did not want the doctor to look for cancer, lived in a nursing home, or were retarded. Physicians recommended mammography less often when the mammography unit was far away or produced poor quality films or ambiguous interpretations. When physicians ran behind schedule, perceived a more urgent medical problem during the encounter, or saw a woman for an acute visit, they recommended mammography significantly less often. CONCLUSIONS. Patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics significantly limit physician recommendations for screening mammography as assessed by clinical vignettes. These characteristics must be addressed if breast cancer mortality is to be reduced with early screening. 
Regulation of human fetal and adult globin genes in mouse erythroleukemia cells. We have examined whether transfected mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells can be used to examine differential expression of human gamma- and beta-globin genes. These cells, which express only their adult globin genes, will transcribe the human adult beta gene but not the fetal gamma genes when they are introduced on an intact human chromosome 11 by cell fusion. However, MEL cells stably transfected with the human A gamma gene attached to one of the active elements (HS2) of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) readily produce gamma-globin mRNA in amounts equivalent to those seen with a comparable beta gene insert. When both beta and gamma genes are attached to HS2, equal amounts of beta A gamma mRNAs are produced, irrespective of the gene order. Furthermore, when HS2 is inserted into the 5' end of a 40-kb cosmid containing the G gamma A gamma-117 delta beta genes in their normal chromosomal organization (but with the Greek HPFH -117 A gamma gene mutation), it directs expression of readily detectable amounts of G gamma A gamma and beta-globin mRNAs in MEL cells. Therefore, under these circumstances we have observed no competition between beta and gamma genes for expression in MEL cells. These findings suggest that MEL cells are capable of perpetuating regulatory information involved in developmental control when it is provided by an intact chromosome, but are incapable of reconstructing such information on transfected DNA. 
The biomechanical effects of deep tissue support as related to brow and facelift procedures. The adverse effects of increased tension across a healing wound are well known. However, the effect of closing a wound in layers in order to decrease tension on the epidermis has been a source of controversy. It is hypothesized that deep tissue support decreases skin tension upon wound closure. In order to clarify this issue, a two-part study was designed to address the immediate effects of deep tissue support in vitro using fresh-frozen cadavers and in vivo on patients undergoing scheduled surgery. Closing skin tension was measured at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed with and without galeal closure and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) procedures, respectively. Deep tissue support was found to significantly (p less than 0.05) decrease skin tension at the time of skin closure at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed on fresh-frozen cadavers. Similar significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in closing skin tension also were found in vivo in patients undergoing similar surgical procedures. Stress relaxation was not found to play a significant role in contributing to this immediate decrease in closing skin tension. It would appear, therefore, that deep tissue support, in the form of galeal closure and an SMAS procedure in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures, respectively, provides increased viscoelastic support, producing immediate significant decreases in closing skin tension in these procedures. The beneficial effects on wound healing, scar formation, tension-related trophic skin changes, and possible improved long-term results are discussed. 
Treatment of neuroendocrine carcinomas with combined etoposide and cisplatin. Evidence of major therapeutic activity in the anaplastic variants of these neoplasms. Forty-five patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were treated with a regimen of etoposide 130 mg/m2/d for 3 days plus cisplatin 45 mg/m2/d on days 2 and 3. Both drugs were given by continuous intravenous infusion. Among 27 patients with well-differentiated carcinoid tumors or islet cell carcinomas, only two partial objective tumor regressions were observed (7%). Among 18 patients prospectively classified as having anaplastic neuroendocrine carcinomas, however, there were nine partial regressions and three complete regressions, an overall regression rate of 67%. For anaplastic disease, the median duration of regression was 8 months (range to 21 months). Tumor response was unrelated to primary site, endocrine hyperfunction, or prior therapy experience. The median survival of all patients with anaplastic tumors was 19 months; this seemed favorable when considering the small experiences with these rare tumors reported in the literature. Toxicity, which was severe for most patients, consisted primarily of vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy. The anaplastic neuroendocrine tumor is strongly responsive to therapy with combined etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with undifferentiated carcinomas, originating in typical neuroendocrine tumor sites (small and large bowel, pancreas, and stomach) or of unknown origin, who have consistent histologic findings by light microscopy should be evaluated for this possibility with appropriate immune staining or electron microscopy. 
MR anatomy and pathology of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, the ventral-most portion of the diencephalon, surrounds the anterior inferior portion of the third ventricle (Fig. 1). It functions primarily as an integrative mechanism for various autonomic and neuroendocrine activities including temperature regulation, water balance, behavior, and appetite. This pictorial essay illustrates the value of MR in depicting the normal anatomy and abnormalities of the hypothalamic region. 
Effect of isradipine on 24-h blood pressure profile demonstrated by repeated monitoring. The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was assessed by repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Using an SPS device (Sandoz Pharma, Basel, Switzerland), monitoring was carried out in 10 male patients with mild essential hypertension (1) after a placebo period, (2) after six months, and (3) after 12 to 13 months of treatment with isradipine (average dose 2.5 mg twice daily). Mean 24-h blood pressure decreased significantly after both periods 2 and 3 (from 148/93 mm Hg to 137/87 and 130/85 mm Hg, respectively). The total number of hypertensive systolic and diastolic blood pressure values also decreased. The normal circadian blood pressure curve was preserved, showing the reduction throughout the 24-h period, and the early morning rise in blood pressure was markedly blunted. These results indicate that isradipine has a favorable effect on the 24-h blood pressure profile that persisted throughout six and 12 months of antihypertensive therapy. 
Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. 
Extubation after transsternal thymectomy for myasthenia gravis: a prospective analysis. Recommendations concerning postoperative extubation after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis are presently based upon retrospective chart reviews. We present the results of a prospective investigation of time to extubation after thymectomy for 14 patients over a 12-month period based upon a protocol that included preoperative immunologic therapy, combined epidural and general anesthesia, postoperative epidural narcotic analgesia, and a standardized approach to discontinuation of ventilatory support. After a neurologist took measures to optimize preoperative neuromuscular function, all 14 patients received agents to produce lumbar epidural anesthesia and light general anesthesia. Muscle relaxants were avoided in all but one patient. Postoperative analgesia was initially maintained with epidural hydromorphone, then therapy was switched to patient-controlled intravenous morphine sulfate. Criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, first measured at the end of anesthesia, were partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.40), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial) less than or equal to 50 mm Hg, pH greater than or equal to 7.30, and respiratory rate less than or equal to 30 breaths/min. If these criteria were not met, ventilatory support was continued postoperatively with intermittent mandatory ventilation, and the patient was weaned gradually from this support. Criteria for extubation included meeting the criteria for weaning, vital capacity greater than or equal to 10 mL/kg, and inspiratory pressure better than -30 cm H2O. Criteria for reintubation included tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 40 breaths/min), respiratory acidosis not due to narcotics, or vital capacity less than or equal to 8 mL/kg. The mean time to extubation was 9 hours (range, 0.75 to 25 hours). Mean preoperative vital capacity was 2.59 +/- 0.64 L (range, 1.90 to 4.20), which decreased approximately 50% to 1.19 +/- 0.39 L (range, 0.70 to 2.0) at the time of extubation. No patient required reintubation. Half of the patients required postoperative anticholinesterase therapy based upon serial neurologic examinations; there were no instances of cholinergic crisis. Thirteen patients returned to the ward on the first postoperative day, and one on the second day. Thirteen patients preferred epidural analgesia to patient-controlled analgesia. The time to extubation and average length of stay in an intensive care setting were markedly reduced compared to those reported in previous retrospective studies. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes neuromuscular function and decreases poststernotomy pulmonary insult will shorten the time to extubation and decrease the length of stay in the intensive care or recovery room after thymectomy. 
Massive hepatic enlargement with fatty change associated with ketoconazole Several forms of hepatic toxicity have been described with the antifungal agent ketoconazole. We report a case of massive liver enlargement with fatty infiltration presenting as gastric compression. This occurred in a young woman with AIDS taking ketoconazole as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. This is the first reported case of ketoconazole causing fatty change in the liver. 
Thalamic atrophy following cerebral infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated shrinkage of the ipsilateral thalamus following infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery in 33 patients who were admitted less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke and who were followed by computed tomography for greater than 1 year with no recurrences. The thalamic area was measured on the computed tomograms, and the ratio of the ipsilateral area to the contralateral area was calculated. All values were compared with values from the initial computed tomogram taken less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke. The values of the ratio on follow-up computed tomograms decreased gradually in 15 patients. In these cases, the area of the ipsilateral thalamus was significantly reduced after 1 year (p less than 0.01) and marked atrophy was observed. These results demonstrate the significance of remote changes over a long period of time after focal cerebral infarction. 
Chronic persistent cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted. 
Extradural haematoma after continuous extradural anaesthesia. We report a case of extradural haematoma occurring after extradural anaesthesia in an anticoagulated patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the haematoma was evacuated surgically. A search of the literature revealed only five previous reports of extradural haematoma in association with extradural anaesthesia. 
Aseptic meningitis following cardiac transplantation: clinical characteristics and relationship to immunosuppressive regimen. Neurologic disorders are uncommon but alarming complications of cardiac transplantation. Of 29 patients from the Utah Cardiac Transplant Program (UCTP) who had lumbar puncture because of change in neurologic function, or to assess fever of uncertain etiology, CSF pleocytosis was present in 14 patients, 4 of whom had an active infectious process involving the nervous system. In 10 other patients, CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures appeared following treatment with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The most prominent clinical signs of this aseptic meningitis syndrome are fever and transient cognitive dysfunction. 
GnRH analogue-induced uterine shrinkage enabling a vaginal hysterectomy and repair in large leiomyomatous uteri. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue was used to reduce large leiomyomas in three young women who were scheduled to have an abdominal hysterectomy and vaginal plastic repair. Significant size decrease due to the hormonal treatment enabled safe vaginal hysterectomy and repair. 
Clinical study of infertile males with varicocele showing no typical radionuclide blood pooling on dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy. A clinical study was done of 19 patients in our male infertility clinic, who were diagnosed as having a varicocele and showed atypical radionuclide accumulation in the dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy. The semen quality was good in 26 percent and poor in 42 percent. Patients with severe congestion in the varicocele tended to be small in number. The dynamic images of the varicoceles were classified into two groups: one group with no radionuclide accumulation, and one group with patchy radionuclide accumulations. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with poor semen quality or with a long infertility period. Neither improvement in the semen quality nor impregnation was achieved postoperatively in patients who had shown no accumulation of the radionuclide in the dynamic imaging. In patients who had shown patchy radionuclide accumulations, the postoperative results were good. We concluded that preoperative dynamic imaging of scrotal scintigraphy is a good means of estimating the postoperative prognosis of fertility. 
Central venous air embolism without a catheter. Venous air embolism is a well-recognized complication of central venous catheterization. Although previous reports have documented venous air embolism occurring in a number of ways, including during initial catheterization, when catheters crack or are disconnected, and after catheter removal, no reports mention the possibility of air embolism occurring when a guide wire without a catheter was in place. A patient is presented who displayed signs and symptoms of venous air embolism (tachypnoea, chest pain, and arterial hypoxaemia) during central venous catheter manipulation while a guide wire alone was in place. Pulse oximetry was used to detect hypoxaemia and suggest an aetiology for the patient's clinical symptoms. It is postulated that a previously described gasp reflex or some sort of sustained negative pressure manoeuvre caused venous air embolism around the guide wire and accounted for the patient's signs and symptoms. During central venous catheter placement, a high index of suspicion for venous air embolism should be maintained, pulse oximetry should be used, the skin entrance site should be kept covered by an occlusive dressing, and the patient should be positioned head-down. 
Arm edema in conservatively managed breast cancer: obesity is a major predictive factor To identify risk factors in the development of arm edema (AE) after conservative management of breast cancer, the authors prospectively measured differences in upper and lower arm circumference in 282 patients with stage I or II breast cancer who received radiation. AE was defined as a difference of 2.5 cm or more in either measurement between treated and untreated arms. Median follow-up was 37 months (range, 7-109 months). The crude frequency of AE overall was 19.5% (55 patients). In 21 patients (7.4%) AE was transient; 34 patients (12.1%) had persistent AE, which is the focus of this article. The 5-year actuarial incidence of persistent AE was 16%. The crude risk of persistent severe AE was 3.9%. Various factors were examined for their ability to enable prediction of AE. Treatment-related factors did not significantly enable prediction of AE, whereas factors related to patient size, such as body mass index, were strongly associated with both the frequency and severity of AE. 
Natural killer activity of human liver-derived lymphocytes in various liver diseases. Liver-derived lymphocytes were isolated from 40 human livers with end-stage liver disease that were removed at the time of orthotopic liver transplantation. In addition, 10 resection specimens or whole livers removed from patients with liver cancer and seven normal livers (unused donor organs) were studied as controls. Liver-derived lymphocytes were isolated from enzymatically digested tissue by gradient centrifugation and adherence to plastic. Their phenotypical characteristics were studied by two-color flow cytometry, and effector cell function was determined in 4-hr 51Cr-release assays against a natural killer-sensitive target, K562 (natural killer activity), natural killer-resistant Daudi line (lymphokine-activated killer activity) and by P815 line with or without phytohemagglutinin to assess lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from normal liver contained equal proportions of T and natural killer lymphocytes (mean natural killer/T ratio = 0.7). CD3-CD56+CD16- natural killer cells were the main natural killer subset present in liver-derived lymphocytes, in contrast to the predominant natural killer phenotype in the circulation (CD56+CD16+). Control liver-derived lymphocytes had levels of cytotoxicity significantly greater than those of the normal peripheral-blood lymphocytes against all three targets. In contrast, liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from organs with advanced liver disease differed markedly in the natural killer/T cell ratio and levels of liver-derived lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma or rejecting allografts treated by immunosuppressive therapy had virtually no cytotoxicity. 
Serum alpha-L-fucosidase. A more sensitive marker for hepatocellular carcinoma? Forty-nine liver disease patients (7 chronic persistent hepatitis, CPH; 10 chronic active hepatitis, CAH; 13 liver cirrhosis, LC; 9 primary hepatocellular carcinoma, PHC, without LC; and 10 PHC with associated LC) and 20 controls were assessed for their serum alpha-L-fucosidase (ALF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and several routine liver injury parameters. Tumor diameter in those with hepatic cancer was assessed by angio-CT. Only ALF and AFP were significantly greater in patients with PHC and PHC + LC patients as compared to patients with LC alone. At an accepted cutoff level of 500 ng/ml, the AFP level provided 43% false negative tests. On the other hand, an ALF level exceeding 740 mumol/hr/ml provided a sensitivity of 84% with a specificity of 94%. No relationship between the ALF level and Child's criteria or with any liver injury parameter was evident. Considering all individual values, the ALF, rather than the AFP, correlated with tumor size. This finding suggests the ALF level may be of value in the early detection of PHC as well as in the follow-up of patients treated for PHC. 
Divided nevus of the eyelid. The two-stage surgical treatment of an adult female patient who presented with a congenital divided nevus of the left upper and lower lid is described. 
A single intravenous infusion of gamma globulin as compared with four infusions in the treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome BACKGROUND. Treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome with a four-day course of intravenous gamma globulin, together with aspirin, has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in preventing coronary-artery lesions and reducing systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that therapy with a single, very high dose of gamma globulin would be at least as effective as the standard regimen. METHODS. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 549 children with acute Kawasaki syndrome. The children were assigned to receive gamma globulin either as a single infusion of 2 g per kilogram of body weight over 10 hours or as daily infusions of 400 mg per kilogram for four consecutive days. Both treatment groups received aspirin (100 mg per kilogram per day through the 14th day of illness, then 3 to 5 mg per kilogram per day). RESULTS. The relative prevalence of coronary abnormalities, adjusted for age and sex, among patients treated with the four-day regimen, as compared with those treated with the single-infusion regimen, was 1.94 (95 percent confidence limits, 1.01 and 3.71) two weeks after enrollment and 1.84 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.89 and 3.82) seven weeks after enrollment. Children treated with the single-infusion regimen had lower mean temperatures while hospitalized (day 2, P less than 0.001; day 3, P = 0.004), as well as a shorter mean duration of fever (P = 0.028). Furthermore, in the single-infusion group the laboratory indexes of acute inflammation moved more rapidly toward normal, including the adjusted serum albumin level (P = 0.004), alpha 1-antitrypsin level (P = 0.007), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.017). Lower IgG levels on day 4 were associated with a higher prevalence of coronary lesions (P = 0.005) and with a greater degree of systemic inflammation. The two groups had a similar incidence of adverse effects (including new or worsening congestive heart failure in nine children), which occurred in 2.7 percent of the children overall. All the adverse effects were transient. CONCLUSIONS. In children with acute Kawasaki disease, a single large dose of intravenous gamma globulin is more effective than the conventional regimen of four smaller daily doses and is equally safe. 
Use of botulinum toxin in strabismus after retinal detachment surgery. Botulinum toxin was used to treat 20 patients with strabismus after retinal detachment surgery. Preinjection motility deviations ranged from 10 to 60 prism diopters (D). Postinjection deviations ranged from 0 to 20 prism D, with 75% being 10 D or less. Eighty-five percent achieved fusion that persisted, with 73% requiring only one or two injections. Only muscles in the eye that had undergone retinal reattachment surgery were injected. The average period of follow-up was 12 months. Complications were rare and all resolved spontaneously. Botulinum toxin appears to be useful as a primary treatment modality for persistent strabismus following retinal detachment surgery, possibly obviating the need for complicated strabismus surgery. 
Gastric ulcer healing: a comparison of enprostil versus ranitidine. Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. We compared the effects of enprostil and ranitidine on the healing of gastric ulcers and the subsequent relapse rates over 6 months. Patients (N = 156) were recruited for a double-blind study from 12 centers in Europe; 71 were randomly assigned to oral treatment with 35 micrograms enprostil twice daily and 85 to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily for up to 8 weeks. Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar. Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%. Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%. Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively. Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers. 
Limitations of open-chest cardiac massage after prolonged, untreated cardiac arrest in dogs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Open-chest cardiac massage is an effective method of resuscitation if instituted within 15 minutes of normothermic cardiac arrest that has failed to respond to ongoing closed-chest CPR efforts. The usefulness of invasive forms of CPR after various periods of untreated cardiac arrest is less certain. This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of open-chest resuscitation after prolonged periods of untreated cardiac arrest. SETTING AND DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation using an animal model of cardiac arrest. Open-chest cardiac massage initially was compared to standard closed-chest compression CPR. The efficacy of open-chest CPR then was evaluated after ten and 40 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty mongrel dogs (24 +/- 1 kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, open-chest resuscitation was significantly better than closed-chest efforts for the production of coronary perfusion pressure (58 +/- 14 vs 2 +/- 1 mm Hg; P less than .05) and initial resuscitation success (five of five vs one of five; P less than .03). Open-chest cardiac massage was equally effective for initial resuscitation if begun after ten or 20 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (five of five vs five of five), but if untreated ventricular fibrillation continued for 40 minutes prior to instituting open-chest massage, no resuscitation benefit was found (none of five; P less than .005). There were marked differences in 24-hour survival depending on the length of time untreated cardiac arrest continued prior to instituting open-chest resuscitation efforts. After 20 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, initial resuscitation was successful with open-chest massage, but long-term survival was poor. CONCLUSION: Open-chest cardiac massage did not produce long-term survival if untreated cardiac arrest persisted for 20 or more minutes prior to invasive resuscitation efforts. 
The impact of colonoscopy on colorectal carcinoma. In an eight-year, ongoing study of 120 patients, 39 with carcinomas and 81 with adenomas, no patient has produced a new carcinoma despite a high incidence of metachronous adenomas. Colonoscopy can identify early carcinomas that can be resected for cure. In addition, colonoscopy can identify the adenomatous polyps and with polypectectomy prevent the progression to carcinoma. Colonoscopy is more accurate than air contrast barium enema, provides a tissue diagnosis, and allows polypectomy. When applied according to risk factors known to be cost effective, colonoscopy leads to earlier diagnosis and thus improved long-term survival. 
The influence of exercise-induced temperature elevations on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR). The influence of exercise on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) was examined in 16 healthy volunteers (8 female and 8 male). Ipsilateral ABR recordings were obtained before and after exercise on a bicycle ergonometer. The rise of body temperature so generated was 0.5-2.1 degrees C (mean, 1.3 degrees C) as measured in the contralateral external auditory meatus. Latencies of waves III and V (but not wave I) were found to be significantly lower immediately post-exercise (P less than 0.01). The temperature relations of the latency of wave V are described by the regression equation: Latency (ms) = 11.06-0.146 x temp. (degrees C). (The effects on amplitude were not significant, nor were male/female differences.) It is suggested that exercise hyperthermia could be an appropriate model for the evaluation of the ABR in fever. 
Vagal stimulation and prevention of sudden death in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. The interest for the antifibrillatory effect of vagal stimulation has been largely limited by the fact that this concept seemed restricted to acute experiments in anesthetized animals. To explore the potentially protective role of vagal stimulation in conscious animals we developed a chronically implantable device to be placed around the cervical right vagus. An anterior myocardial infarction was produced in 161 dogs; 1 month later an exercise stress test was performed on the 105 survivors. Toward the end of the test the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 minutes. Fifty-nine (56%) dogs developed ventricular fibrillation and, before this test was repeated, were assigned either to a control group (n = 24) or to be instrumented with the vagal device (n = 35). Five dogs were excluded because of electrode malfunction. Compared with the heart rate level attained after 30 seconds of occlusion during exercise in the control test, vagal stimulation led to a decrease of approximately 75 beats/min (from 255 +/- 33 to 170 +/- 36 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the control group 22 (92%) of 24 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during the second exercise and ischemia test. By contrast, during vagal stimulation ventricular fibrillation occurred in only 3 (10%) of the 30 dogs tested and recurred in 26 (87%) during an additional exercise and ischemia test in the control condition (p less than 0.001 versus the vagal stimulation test; internal control analysis). Combined analysis of the tests performed in the control condition showed that ventricular fibrillation was reproducible in 48 (89%) of the 54 dogs tested. The protective effect of vagal stimulation was also significant in the group comparison analysis and even after exclusion of those four dogs in which ventricular fibrillation was not reproducible (92% versus 11.5%, control versus vagal stimulation, p less than 0.001). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing, the vagally mediated protection was still significant (p = 0.015) as five (55%) of nine dogs survived the test. This study shows that vagal stimulation, performed shortly after the onset of an acute ischemic episode in conscious animals with a healed myocardial infarction, can effectively prevent ventricular fibrillation. This striking result seems to depend on multiple mechanisms having a synergistic action. The decrease in heart rate is an important but not always essential protective mechanism. The electrophysiological effects secondary to the vagally mediated antagonism of the sympathetic activity on the heart are likely to play a major role. 
Analysis of beta, gamma, and delta T-cell receptor genes in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The authors have analyzed the configuration of immunoglobulin (Ig) and beta, gamma and delta T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in DNA extracted from skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 41 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF), 14 patients with Sezary syndrome, and 13 patients with benign inflammatory dermatoses. No discrete rearranged bands (DRB) were detected in patients with inflammatory dermatoses. In tissue DNA from 19 patients with MF DRB were detected with beta and gamma, but not delta TCR probes. Only one patient with MF had a rearrangement of gamma and delta with germ line beta TCR genes. In 13 patients multiple biopsies were analyzed and DRB, when present, were identical in different lesions from individual patients. In three patients analysis of DNA from dermatopathic lymph nodes did not reveal DRB. Analysis of peripheral blood DNA from 24 patients revealed a discrete rearrangement of the gamma TCR gene in four patients and both beta and gamma genes in four additional patients. In MF DRB were detected more frequently with advancing stage of disease in tissues (P less than 0.01) but not in peripheral blood (P equals 0.36). Of 14 patients with Sezary syndrome, eight had DRB in peripheral blood DNA with both beta and gamma probes and in three of these patients identical DRB were also detected in DNA from skin biopsy samples. In contrast, DRB were not detected in the peripheral blood of the other six patients. In both MF and Sezary syndrome there was no restricted usage of particular V gamma genes. These results indicate that in MF (1) T-cell clones can be detected in skin biopsy specimens from the majority of patients with early stage disease, (2) gamma delta T-cell clones are only rarely found, and (3) TCR gene analysis can detect T-cell clones in the peripheral blood with a greater degree of specificity than conventional light microscopic study. In Sezary syndrome these studies also suggest that a subset of patients have a polyclonal population of circulating atypical lymphoid cells. In addition these patients appear to have a better prognosis than those with monoclonal disease. 
Soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma. Characterization in established cultures and xenografts with evidence of a neuroectodermic phenotype. This study characterizes the histogenesis of soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma (StEs) based upon an analysis of three tumors. Long-term cultured cell lines and nude mice xenografts were established from original neoplasms or from their metastases. Histologically they revealed a small round cell pattern without signs of differentiation. Several ultrastructural features of neural type were found; the same were also seen on culture cell lines. Moreover, immunohistochemical study for neural markers revealed the presence of HNK-1, NSE, LIRC-LON 36, S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments (70 kilodaltons), and chromogranin; some of these markers were present only in the transplants. Cytokeratin was also seen. The translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) was found in all three neoplasms together with other chromosomal abnormalities. N-myc RNA gave negative results whereas c-myc RNA was expressed. Therefore it may be postulated that StEs displays neuroectodermal features somewhat similar to those seen in peripheral neuroepithelioma as well as in atypical Ewing's sarcoma of bone. 
Concurrent nitroglycerin administration decreases thrombolytic potential of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Dynamic coronary vasoconstriction may play a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving rt-PA alone (36 +/- 52 versus 63 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given rt-PA with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given rt-PA alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of rt-PA were lower when nitroglycerin was given with rt-PA alone (427 +/- 279 versus 1,471 +/- 600 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). 
Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. PURPOSE PATIENTS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers (DUs). To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding. RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers. HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients. Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks. HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment. The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs. 
Prevention of restenosis by lovastatin after successful coronary angioplasty. Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). 
Hemorrhagic events during therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Phase II Trial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of invasive procedures, hemostatic and clinical variables, the timing of beta-blocker therapy, and the doses of recombinant plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on hemorrhagic events. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Hospitals participating in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II trial (TIMI II). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin. The total dose of rt-PA was 150 mg for the first 520 patients and 100 mg for the remaining 2819 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to an invasive strategy (coronary arteriography with percutaneous angioplasty [if feasible] done routinely 18 to 48 hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy) or to a conservative strategy (coronary arteriography done for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia). Eligible patients were also randomly assigned to either immediate intravenous or deferred beta-blocker therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for hemorrhagic events during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: In patients on the 100-mg rt-PA regimen, major and minor hemorrhagic events were more common among those assigned to the invasive than among those assigned to the conservative strategy (18.5% versus 12.8%, P less than 0.001). Major or minor hemorrhagic events were associated with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown, peak rt-PA levels, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to more than 90 seconds, weight of 70 kg or less, female gender, and physical signs of cardiac decompensation. Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased morbidity due to hemorrhagic complications is associated with an invasive management strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our findings show the complex interaction of several factors in the occurrence of hemorrhagic events during thrombolytic therapy. 
Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain assessment after intracerebroventricular administration in patients with terminal cancer. Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain relief were evaluated after intracerebroventricular administration of morphine (0.4 +/- 0.11 mg) in seven patients with cancer suffering from intractable pain. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lumbar CSF, and plasma morphine concentrations were analyzed by a specific morphine radioimmunoassay. A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF. Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes). Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours. The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve. The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia. 
Intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve function in cerebellopontine angle surgery. Facial nerve paralysis associated with cerebellopontine angle surgery has been reported to range up to 26% in a recent series. Various methods of intraoperatively monitoring the facial nerve have been developed to reduce the incidence of facial paralysis. We report our experience with an intraoperative monitoring technique using intramuscular EMG electrodes to detect subclinical electrical responses that were amplified and made audible to the operating surgeon after gating stimulus artifacts. A 3.6% incidence of facial paralysis in 111 consecutive cases with this intraoperative monitoring method compared with 14.5% in 207 previously unmonitored cases indicates significant reduction of this complication in cerebellopontine angle surgery (p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in facial paralysis, an increase in the percentage of partial facial paresis was observed in the monitored group (p less than 0.05). The percentage of those with intact facial function was similar in the monitored (82.0%) and unmonitored groups (78.3%). 
Transient pulsus alternans induced by isosorbide dinitrate: echocardiographic and hemodynamic evidence of reduced venous return--a case report. Transient pulsus alternans was induced by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in a patient with postmyocarditis congestive heart failure under diuretic therapy. The severity and duration of pulsus alternans depended on the dose of ISDN. According to the echocardiographic and hemodynamic examinations, the superimposed preload reduction caused by ISDN combined with decreased blood volume owing to diuretic therapy most likely contributed to the development of pulsus alternans. 
Meningitis from canine Pasteurella multocida following mastoidectomy. A case of Pasteurella multocida meningitis, following a mastoidectomy is presented. The association of close contact with pets, many of which harbour Pasteurella multocida as part of their normal buccal flora. This case confirms the potential benefit of taking an ear swab prior to mastoid surgery and in seeking an appropriate 'pet' history. 
Common reactions to transfusions. A blood transfusion is a special kind of transplantation, with the transfer of living tissue from one person to another. Reactions can occur with as little as 10 to 15 ml of incompatible blood. The onset of a reaction may be misleading or delayed, and its detection requires astute assessment. Responsibility for recognition of a transfusion reaction lies with the transfusionist, who is often a nurse. The following types of response can occur: hemolytic reactions, transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease, hemoglobinuria, purpura, fever, circulatory overload, thrombophlebitis, urticaria, hyperkalemia, asymptomatic hemoglobinuria, pulmonary edema, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Critical care nurses need to be aware of the dangers of blood and blood product transfusions and to be prepared to react quickly. 
Presentation of acute uterine inversion in the emergency department. A case of acute puerperal uterine inversion is described in a patient who presented to the emergency department after a home birth and a prolonged third stage of labor. The cardinal findings were shock and excessive blood loss. The uterus and attached placenta were protruding from the vagina and the normal cervical landmarks were absent. Emergency management consisted in vigorous fluid resuscitation prior to transfer to the operating room for definitive reversion. 
Gastric carcinoma presenting as an exacerbation of ulcers during pregnancy. A case report. Gastric cancer is unusual during pregnancy. Also, because of the physiologic changes that occur with pregnancy, it is rare to see a worsening of peptic ulcers during pregnancy. A patient with an exacerbation of peptic ulcers presented with gastric carcinoma during pregnancy. 
Obliterations of the proximal subclavian artery: to bypass or to anastomose? A clinical series has been analysed to determine which of two similar, extrathoracic "extraanatomic" methods of treating proximal blocks of the subclavian artery is the superior option. From 1975 until 1988 direct carotid-subclavian anastomosis was used in 32 patients and carotid-subclavian bypass in 19. There were no statistically significant differences for the probability of postoperative survival (p less than 0.877 Breslow; p less than 0.774 Mantel), intraoperative blood loss or the duration of anaesthesia. Those patients who had undergone subclavian artery repair had a significantly longer survival than those following carotid bifurcation endarterectomy (p less than 0.002 Breslow, p less than 0.0002 Mantel). As patients with subclavian lesions have a reasonable life-expectancy, they may possibly experience late complications of their vascular repair. Therefore it seems important to select the most durable operation, and direct carotid subclavian anastomosis has a significantly greater patency rate than bypass (p less than 0.006 Breslow, p less than 0.006 Mantel). Patients with preoperative symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency had a lower probability of survival than those with upper extremity claudication, although this did not reach statistical significance (p less than 0.205 Breslow; p less than 0.198 Mantel). 
Practical approach to the diagnosis of unexplained chest pain. Chest pain is a frequent medical problem causing concern for both patients and physicians. A multidisciplinary meeting recently developed algorithms for evaluating these patients in the two most common scenarios for the presentation of chest pain: (1) new onset of chest pain in the primary care setting, and (2) recurrent chest pain in the the referral setting. In both situations, the primary care physician, rather than specialists, should direct the evaluation and treatment of patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms. 
Differential susceptibility of activated macrophage cytotoxic effector reactions to the suppressive effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1. We examined the effects of TGF-beta 1 on induction of several activated macrophage antimicrobial activities against the protozoan parasite Leishmania, and on induction of tumoricidal activity against the fibrosarcoma tumor target 1023. TGF-beta by itself did not affect the viability of either the intracellular or extracellular target in concentrations up to 200 ng/ml. As little as 1 ng/ml TGF-beta, however, suppressed more than 70% of the intracellular killing activity of macrophages treated with lymphokines. In contrast, more than 100 ng/ml TGF-beta was required to suppress intracellular killing by cells activated with an equivalent amount of recombinant IFN-gamma. Addition of TGF-beta for up to 30 min after exposure to activation factors significantly reduced macrophage killing of intracellular parasites. Pretreatment of macrophages with TGF-beta was even more effective: treatment of cells with TGF-beta for 4 h before addition of activation factors abolished all macrophage intracellular killing activity. Regardless of treatment sequence, however, TGF-beta had absolutely no effect, at any concentration tested, on activated macrophage resistance to infection induced by lymphokines or by the cooperative interaction of IFN-gamma and IL-4. Effects of TGF-beta on tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages was intermediate to that of its effects on intracellular killing or resistance to infection. Lymphokine-induced tumor cytotoxicity was marginally (25%) affected by TGF-beta; 200 ng/ml was able to suppress IFN-gamma-induced tumoricidal activity by 40%. Thus, TGF-beta dramatically suppressed certain activated macrophage cytotoxic effector reactions, but was only partially or not at all effective against others, even when the same activation agent (IFN-gamma) was used. The biochemical target for TGF-beta suppressive activity in these reactions may be the pathway for nitric oxide production from L-arginine, because TGF-beta also inhibited the generation of nitric oxide by cytokine-activated macrophages. 
Gastrointestinal cytology. Since the development of the fiberoptic endoscope, laboratories have received cytologic specimens obtained from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract in increasing numbers to identify infectious agents and neoplasms. Adenocarcinomas generally are easily diagnosed and distinguished from reparative atypia, but their precursor lesions, dysplasia and adenomas, provide greater interpretive challenges. The same is true for such entities as malignant lymphomas. Most mesenchymal tumors remain outside the diagnostic capabilities of most cytologists. 
Central nervous system toxicity from nebulized atropine sulfate. Central anticholinergic intoxication can result from iatrogenic sources. We report the occurrence of a central anticholinergic syndrome in a patient treated with aerosolized atropine. 
Noninvasive grading of musculoskeletal tumors using PET. Twenty-five patients with mass lesions involving the musculoskeletal system were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in order to determine if a relationship exists between histologic grade and tumor uptake of [fluorine-18]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). There were 6 benign lesions and 19 malignant lesions of various grades. A high correlation (Rho = 0.83) was found between the normalized uptake of tracer and the NCl grade. The high-grade malignancies had significantly greater (p = 0.0091) uptake of FDG than the combination of benign lesions and low-grade malignancies. All lesions with a normalized uptake value of 1.6 or greater were high-grade, while all lesions less than 1.6 represented either benign tumors or low grade malignancies. This strong relationship between FDG uptake and grade among neoplasms from a wide variety of cell types within a single organ system suggests that the technique may be useful in predicting grade even when the cell type is unknown. 
The association of laryngoceles with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The clinical diagnosis of laryngoceles simultaneously occurring with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is infrequent; however, when specimens from patients with laryngeal cancer have been examined closely, the two entities have been associated in 4.9% to 28.8% of cases. Despite this apparent relationship, the literature has failed to address the potential impact of a concurrent laryngocele on surgical decision making. Also, the wide variation in the reported rates of simultaneous occurrence of these two entities is unexplained. We performed whole-organ histopathologic analysis on a laryngeal specimen with bilateral external laryngoceles associated with squamous cell carcinoma and correlated this to computed tomography findings. Based on this information and other reports concerning the pattern of spread of carcinoma within laryngoceles, it appears that supraglottic laryngectomy is oncologically sound in the presence of a laryngocele as long as the usual criteria for this procedure are met. 
Cardiovascular causes of syncope. Identifying and controlling trigger mechanisms. Syncope usually has a cardiovascular source, so neurologic evaluation has a low diagnostic yield in these patients. Cardiac arrhythmias in persons with or without structural heart disease can produce syncope. Neurocardiogenic dysfunction that results in diminished venous return and hypercontractility is another frequent cause. Postural hypotension or left ventricular outflow obstruction may also be to blame. Careful history taking and physical examination, head-up tilt testing, echocardiography or radionuclide isotope imaging, and electrophysiologic study are often diagnostic. However, syncope remains undiagnosed in some patients, and they may require periodic reassessment. Treatment options are available for most cardiovascular disorders, among them use of pharmacologic agents; catheter, surgical, or radio-frequency modification of certain tachycardias; and permanent pacing. 
Fact and fancy. What can we really tell from the placenta? Considerable interest in the clinical significance of placental abnormalities has been fueled by malpractice claims when perinatal outcome is less than optimal. The pathologist must be aware of those placental lesions that may contribute to perinatal morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the abnormalities of placentation, placental weight, maternal uteroplacental blood flow, villous histological makeup, fetoplacental blood flow, the umbilical cord, and the membranes, as well as the problems of multiple pregnancy. The important contribution of abnormal uteroplacental blood flow to adverse perinatal outcome is emphasized, as is the need to determine the extent of placental damage when evaluating the contribution thereto of particular placental abnormalities. 
Pronounced reduction of aortic flow velocity and acceleration during heavy isometric exercise in coronary artery disease. Doppler-derived parameters of aortic flow were examined during heavy isometric exercise in 48 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 48 gender- and age-matched healthy controls. The aim was to determine which parameters best separated the groups and to look for a possible relation between exercise-induced Doppler patterns and the extent of CAD. Isometric exercise was performed with a 2-hand bar dynamometer, and the subjects were required to perform 50% of maximal voluntary contraction for 2 minutes. Examination was performed with a pulsed Doppler transducer positioned at the suprasternal notch. Resting peak flow velocity, acceleration time, stroke volume index and cardiac index did not show significant differences between the groups. However, mean acceleration and stroke work were significantly lower in patients with CAD. In this group, exercise peak flow velocity decreased from 98 +/- 13 to 55 +/- 12 cm/s, flow velocity integral from 14 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 3 cm, mean acceleration from 11 +/- 0.9 to 4.7 +/- 1 m/s/s, and stroke volume index from 41 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 4 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001 for all). Cardiac index decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.4 to 2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). Acceleration time increased from 82 +/- 6 to 116 +/- 7 ms. In most of the indexes, the directional changes induced by isometric exercise were similar in patients with CAD and in normal control subjects. The differences compared with the rest values were significantly greater in the CAD group, and especially in patients presenting with 3-vessel disease. 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome associated with endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary. Both EST and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome are uncommon disorders. This report illustrates a case of these two rare conditions occurring in the same patient. Patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, although not appearing to be at increased risk for germ cell tumors, unlike testicular feminization patients, are not immune to ovarian cancer. Therefore, individuals with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome should still be followed gynecologically because they are at least at the normal risk of developing ovarian as well as other gynecological neoplasms. 
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate) induced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a woman undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. Moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred after LA was administered to control menorrhagia in an anephric woman who required hemodialysis. We postulate that women who require dialysis may be at special risk for the development of this syndrome. 
Structure-dependent dynamic mechanical behavior of fibrous caps from human atherosclerotic plaques. BACKGROUND. Although thrombosis associated with a fissured atherosclerotic plaque is believed to be the most common cause of acute coronary syndromes, the underlying factors that trigger plaque rupture are currently unknown. However, the mechanical behavior of the plaque is probably of critical importance. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of a plaque are dependent on its composition and, in particular, that the stiffness of fibrous caps changes within the range of frequencies carried by a physiological pressure wave, the stress-strain relation was studied in 27 fibrous caps and related to the underlying histological structure of the fibrous cap. Fibrous caps were obtained during 14 autopsies from the abdominal aorta and were classified by histological examination as cellular (n = 7), hypocellular (n = 9), or calcified (n = 11). Hypocellular fibrous caps were 1-2 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005), and calcified caps were 4-5 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005). All 27 fibrous caps demonstrated an increase in stiffness with increasing frequencies of stress ranging from 0.05 to 10 Hz; the increase in stiffness was similar in all three histological classes. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the stiffness of fibrous caps from human atherosclerotic plaques is related to the underlying histological structure and that the stiffness increases with frequency in the range of physiological heart rates. The protective benefit of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents in coronary artery disease may, in part, be related to the frequency dependence of atherosclerotic plaque stiffness. 
Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. 
Identical orocecal transit time and serum motilin in hyperthermia and normothermia. Fever, exercise, and exposure to a hot environment can all cause symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction as they elevate body temperature. Nonetheless, the link between hyperthermia per se and these symptoms is unknown. To test the functional significance of increased body temperature, we investigated the influence of substantial passive hyperthermia on orocecal transit in 12 young, healthy men. Transit time was determined by a consistent rise in H2 concentration in a rebreathing apparatus after oral ingestion of 0.7 g lactulose/kg body weight. Lactulose was given in combination with a 350-ml liquid meal (360 kcal). After raising core temperature in warm water to 38.3 degrees C, orocecal transit time was identical to control (90 +/- 13 min at 38.3 degrees C, 92 +/- 13 min at 37.1 degrees C). While hyperthermia did elevate heart rate and minute ventilation, serum motilin, gastrin, and cortisol were similar in the two conditions. The failure of a passive core temperature rise to alter mouth-to-cecum transit suggests that this aspect of alimentary function is independent of body temperature. 
Breslow thickness of cutaneous malignant melanoma in paraffin wax and frozen sections. Breslow tumour thickness was measured in frozen and paraffin wax sections from 21 excision biopsies of cutaneous malignant melanomas by two observers. There was no consistent variation between frozen and paraffin wax sections, with recorded differences ranging from +0.3 mm to -0.2 mm. Interobserver differences ranged from +0.4 mm to -0.2 mm. The interobserver variations exceeded the intraobserver variations, but neither were significant. These findings show conclusively that, when using high quality frozen sections, there is no significant difference between Breslow thickness measured in frozen or paraffin wax sections and therefore that frozen sections can be used to microstage melanoma. Interobserver variations seem to be a more likely source of erroneous measurements of tumour thickness. 
Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. 
Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with acute leukemia. Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection. 
A randomized trial evaluating leuprolide acetate before hysterectomy as treatment for leiomyomas. Fifty premenopausal patients requiring hysterectomy as treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas, which were the size of 14 to 18 weeks' gestation, were randomized into two groups to determine whether preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist would increase the feasibility of vaginal rather than abdominal hysterectomy. The control group (group A; n = 25) did not receive preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, but patients in Group B (n = 25) received 2 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist before undergoing hysterectomy. Patients in the two groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, pretreatment uterine size, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Patients in group B had an increase in hemoglobin levels (10.75 to 12.12 gm/dl, p less than 0.05) and a decrease in uterine volume (1086.7 to 723.4 ml, p less than 0.05) after 8 weeks of agonist therapy and were more likely to undergo vaginal hysterectomy (76.0% vs 16%). Patients in group B also had shorter hospitalizations (5.2 vs 3.8 days, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for 2 months followed by vaginal hysterectomy is preferable to abdominal hysterectomy in selected patients with uterine leiomyomas. 
Cleft palate fistulas: a multivariate statistical analysis of prevalence, etiology, and surgical management. A retrospective, multivariate statistical analysis of 129 consecutive nonsyndromic patients undergoing cleft palate repair was performed to document the incidence of postoperative fistulas, to determine their cause, and to review methods of surgical management. Nasal-alveolar fistulas and/or anterior palatal fistulas that were intentionally not repaired were excluded from study. Cleft palate fistulas (CPFs) occurred in 30 of 129 patients (23 percent), although nearly a half were 1 to 2 mm in size. Extent of clefting, as estimated by the Veau classification, was significantly more severe in those patients who developed cleft palate fistula. Type of palate closure also influenced the frequency of cleft palate fistula. Forty-three percent of patients undergoing Wardill-type closures developed cleft palate fistula versus 10, 22, and 0 percent for Furlow, von Langenbeck, and Dorrance style closures, respectively. The fistula rate was similar in patients with (30 percent) and without (25 percent) intravelar veloplasty. Age at palate closure did not significantly affect the rate of fistulization; however, the surgeon performing the initial closure did not have an effect. Thirty-seven percent of patients developed recurrent cleft palate fistulas following initial fistula repair. Recurrence of cleft palate fistulas was not influenced by severity of cleft or type of original palate repair. Following end-stage management, a second cleft palate fistula recurrence occurred in 25 percent of patients. Continued open discussion of results of cleft palate repair is recommended. 
Deafness after bilateral midbrain contusion: a correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with auditory brain stem evoked responses. A 46-year-old woman became deaf after a closed head injury. When a computed tomographic scan failed to disclose the cause, conversion disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, showed bilateral contusions of the inferior colliculi, providing objective evidence for an organic cause of hearing loss. Auditory brain stem evoked responses and stapedial reflexes also provided objective evidence of brain stem injury. This case illustrates the phenomenon of dorsal midbrain injury after head trauma. It indicates the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for small focal lesions after head trauma, and it demonstrates some difficulties in the diagnosis of "hysterical" deafness. 
Chronic cough in children. Chronic cough in children is a frequent complaint seen by the primary health care provider. Although many of these coughs spontaneously resolve, some are caused by a more serious process and require further attention. Selecting those patients who will benefit from a more extensive evaluation can be a difficult challenge. An overview is provided that emphasizes a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of chronic cough. 
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and cardiovascular collapse in a young child owing to environmentally acquired cocaine. Acute crack cocaine intoxication has become a significant problem in both adolescent and adult patients. Recently, cases of cocaine toxicity in infants and toddlers have been described. We report a four-year-old child with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock after intoxication by crack cocaine. Acute cocaine intoxication should be considered in the differential for hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock. The gastrointestinal decontamination following cocaine ingestion is discussed. 
The t(1;22) (p13;q13) is nonrandom and restricted to infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group Study. We report the nonrandom occurrence and frequency of the t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its close association with the French-American-British M7 subtype of AML in infants (less than 1 year). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment. Identification of this nonrandom translocation exclusively in infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) implies that it may serve as an additional diagnostic marker for this disease and links it to the pathogenesis of AMkL in infants. 
Intracellular calcium and ventricular fibrillation. Studies in the aequorin-loaded isovolumic ferret heart. To elucidate the role of changes in [Ca2+]i in the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF), Ca2+i signals, epicardial electrical potentials, and isovolumic left ventricular pressure were simultaneously recorded in isolated intact ferret hearts loaded with aequorin, a bioluminescent protein. When the preparations were perfused with 3 microM acetylstrophanthidin and 8 mM Ca2+, or with a low Na+ solution (18 mM Na+, 100 mM Li+), spontaneous transitions to the VF state were consistently observed within a short period of time. The initiation of spontaneous VF was preceded by development of a Ca2+i overload state, coincidental with the ascending phase of diastolic Ca2+i oscillations, and was followed by further elevation in Ca2+i levels, which were associated with augmented Ca2+i oscillations of a saw-toothed pattern. Pretreatment with 10 microM ryanodine, which blocked Ca2+i oscillations in the preparation, did not eliminate inducibility of VF by means of AC electrical stimulations; however, VF no longer occurred spontaneously, and the threshold for VF induction increased markedly. In the absence of a state of Ca2+i overload, spontaneous defibrillation occurred within a minute after the initiation of VF. We conclude that 1) VF can be induced in the absence of Ca2+i oscillations; however, 2) Ca2+i oscillations play a crucial role as a trigger for VF and therefore are an important determinant of the vulnerability to VF; and 3) the augmented Ca2+i oscillations after the transition to VF state may support the maintenance of this type of arrhythmia. 
Urinary fibrinopeptide A in evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. A prospective pilot study. This pilot study assessed the urinary fibrinopeptide A (uFPA) levels and the combination of uFPA test plus ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). One hundred consecutive patients were studied prospectively. Twenty-nine patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria defined in this study (seven with and 22 without PE). The uFPA concentration was significantly higher in patients with than without PE (41.1 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mg of creatinine, p less than 0.0001). In all patients with PE, the uFPA levels were higher than threshold value derived by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean uFPA concentration of patients without PE. In patients without PE, the V/Q scan was negative in 16, the uFPA test was negative in 18, and at least one of the tests was negative in 21. These preliminary data suggest that a negative uFPA test may be helpful in excluding PE and that uFPA in combination with V/Q lung scans may correctly exclude PE in more patients than either test alone. Further studies in a large unselected population are needed to confirm these results. 
Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) isolation from blood and brain of experimentally infected macaques. The possibility of using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques to study pathogenic events linked to HIV infection of the brain prompted us to investigate some of the virological features in SIV-infected macaques. Nine cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with SIVsm and killed at different times. We successfully isolated virus from the blood of all the animals and from the brains of eight. These results point to the early and regular spread of this lentivirus to the brain. Neutralizing activity was studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from these macaques against a selected group of isolates. Cerebrospinal fluid did not show any neutralizing activity. Our findings integrate the observations from HIV-1 infection in man and indicate that SIV infection of macaques is a useful model for studying pathogenic events of brain infection. 
Clinical relevance of tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene amplification in childhood neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. We assessed tumor cell DNA content (ploidy) and N-myc gene copy number as predictors of long-term disease-free survival in 298 children with neuroblastoma. Diploid tumor stem lines were identified in 101 patients (34%), clonal hyperdiploid abnormalities in 194 (65%), and hypodiploid stem lines in three (1%). In children with widely disseminated tumors at diagnosis (stage D), ploidy had a highly age-dependent influence on prognosis. Among infants (less than 12 months) treated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, hyperdiploidy was closely associated with long-term disease-free survival (greater than 90% of cases), while diploidy invariably predicted early treatment failure (P less than .001). Similarly, in children 12 to 24 months of age who were treated with cisplatin-teniposide and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, diploidy uniformly predicted early failure, whereas half of the children with hyperdiploidy achieved long-term disease-free survival (P less than .001). There was no relationship between ploidy and treatment outcome in children older than 24 months with stage D tumors who had a very low probability of long-term disease-free survival (less than 10%). N-myc gene amplification was detected in 37 (25%) of the 147 tumors tested, with the remainder showing single-copy levels of the gene. N-myc gene amplification was more frequent in diploid than in hyperdiploid tumors (23 of 57 v 14 of 87, P = .001) and predicted a high likelihood of early treatment failure. In children younger than 2 years with disseminated neuroblastoma, tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene copy number provide complementary prognostic information that will distinguish patients who can be cured on current regimens from those who require new treatment strategies. 
Bradycardic responses to vagally mediated bedside maneuvers in healthy volunteers. PURPOSE: To determine the relative potency in healthy individuals of the vagally mediated reflexes used clinically to inhibit sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease performed face immersion in cold water and the Valsalva maneuver twice, to maximum endurance and to the subjective point of first discomfort, and face immersion in warm water and the Muller maneuver to maximum endurance only. Right and left carotid massage and left, right, and bilateral eyeball compression were each performed for 15 seconds. Change in heart rate was taken as baseline minus the rate over the slowest three consecutive QRS cycles elicited by each maneuver. Fisher's least-significant-difference multiple comparison procedure was used to analyze heart rate responses. Significance was defined as p less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: Maximum pulse decrements from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in beats/minute were as follows: cold-water face immersion to maximum endurance 15.5 (12.3 to 18.5), cold-water face immersion to first discomfort 10.1 (6.7 to 13.1), Valsalva maneuver to maximum endurance 9.2 (6.3 to 12.4), Valsalva maneuver to first discomfort 8.3 (5.0 to 11.3), right carotid massage 7.3 (4.3 to 10.3), left carotid massage 5.2 (2.3 to 8.4), right eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), left eyeball compression 6.6 (3.6 to 9.5), bilateral eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), warm-water face immersion 7.0 (3.2 to 9.8), and Muller maneuver 1.6 (-1.3 to 4.9). Bradycardia was significantly greater for cold-water immersion of the face performed to maximum endurance than for all other maneuvers. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the diving reflex is the most potent of the vagally mediated reflexes utilized in clinical practice. Immersion of the face in cold water may prove effective at the bedside when other maneuvers fail to augment vagal tone adequately. 
A human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG) promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children. To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea. 
Comparison of different doses of epinephrine on myocardial perfusion and resuscitation success during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a pig model. Published results of dose-response effects of adrenergic drugs (epinephrine [E]) vary so much between studies because of differences in animal models and duration of ischemia before drug administration. In this investigation the effects of different doses of E on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and resuscitation success were compared during closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a 4-minute period of ventricular fibrillation in 28 pigs. MBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm using tracer microspheres. After 4 minutes of ventricular fibrillation CPR was performed with the use of a pneumatic piston compressor. After 4 minutes of mechanical measures only, the animals were randomly allocated into four groups of seven, receiving 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, and 0.090 mg/kg E intravenously respectively. MBF measurements were started 45 seconds after E administration; hemodynamic measurements after 90 seconds. Four minutes after the first administration, the same E dose was given before defibrillation. The CPP of animals given 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 and 0.090 mg/kg E were as follows: 16.3 +/- 6.1, 25.6 +/- 5.8, 33.2 +/- 8.4 and 30.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg. The left ventricular MBF values were: 14 +/- 9, 27 +/- 11, 43 +/- 6, 46 +/- 10 mL/min/100 g. The differences between the groups receiving 0.015 and 0.045 mg/kg and between the groups receiving 0.015 mg/kg and 0.090 mg/kg were statistically significant (P less than .05). Resuscitation success was 14.3%, 42.9%, 100% and 86.7% respectively. A significant difference in resuscitation success was found only between 0.015 mg/kg and 0.045 mg/kg E. 
Detection of fibronectin receptor in sera: its clinical significance as a parameter of hepatic fibrosis. Pooled sera collected from cirrhotic patients was fractionated by affinity chromatography with a fibronectin receptor monoclonal antibody against the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor. Eluates were assayed using Western immunoblotting. The relative mobility of the protein reactive with fibronectin receptor antibody was nearly identical to that of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor, confirming that fibronectin receptor is present in human serum. Serum levels of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor were analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with various liver diseases. The serum level of fibronectin receptor (micrograms/ml) was significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis (inactive, 2.59 +/- 0.04; active, 3.45 +/- 0.13), cirrhosis (4.77 +/- 0.30), alcoholic liver disease (2.96 +/- 0.16) and hepatocellular carcinoma (4.71 +/- 0.49) than in normal subjects (2.11 +/- 0.08). Strong positive correlation was observed between serum levels of fibronectin receptor and histological findings, particularly in the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Immunohistochemical studies with fibronectin receptor antibody revealed that the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor was present on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells in the normal liver and was increased in fibrotic areas and on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells of fibrotic liver. The serum level of fibronectin receptor in patients with chronic liver diseases may therefore be a useful marker of hepatic fibrosis. 
Occupational urticaria from welding polyurethane. An urticarial reaction associated with high fever developed in a welder on four occasions while he was welding steel profiles filled with polyurethane. The fumes emitted during pyrolysis of polyurethane and inhaled by the patient probably caused the urticarial reaction. Provocation tests with two pyrolysis products, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 4,4-diaminophenylmethane, were negative. This case demonstrates the difficulty in detecting the cause of urticaria induced by airborne chemicals. 
Timing of surgery during menstrual cycle and survival of premenopausal women with operable breast cancer Timing of operation in relation to menstrual phase might affect outlook in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer. We examined the records of 249 such women treated between 1975 and 1985, and compared overall and recurrence-free survival in those whose operation was 3-12 days after their last menstrual period (LMP) (group 1, n = 75) with those in whom it was 0-2 or 13-32 days after LMP (group 2, n = 174). Overall and recurrence-free survival were greatly reduced in group 1 women (p less than 0.001 for both). Actuarial survival at 10 years was 54% in group 1 versus 84% in group 2. This effect was independent of other factors, was of much the same importance as nodal status in multivariate analysis, was largely confined to histologically node-positive cases, seemed to be greater in women with small tumours (less than or equal to 2 cm), and was seen in patients with oestrogen-receptor positive and negative tumours. Thus phase of menstrual cycle at operation is of great importance for long-term outlook in premenopausal women with breast cancer. 
Cardiovascular surgery in blacks. The available information concerning cardiovascular surgery in blacks is very limited and incomplete. Those few reports that do exist seem to show that the usual indications for surgery, preoperative findings, and final results can be expected. Acquired heart disease is as important a cause of mortality in African Americans as in others and is amenable to surgical intervention. Surgical mortality is easily attributable to the usual iatrogenic variables or comorbid disease. At present it is uncertain whether the incidence of inoperable disease or problems of access to health care are responsible for the low rate of utilization by blacks. A more accurate account will become available when large-volume programs begin to report their results. 
Six-year retrospective surveillance of gastroenteritis viruses identified at ten electron microscopy centers in the United States and Canada. To identify the prevalence, seasonality and demographic characteristics of patients with viral gastroenteritis, we reviewed 6 years of retrospective data on viral agents of gastroenteritis screened by electron microscopy at 10 centers in the United States and Canada. From 52,691 individual electron microscopic observations, a virus was detected in 16% of specimens, and the yearly positive detection rate among centers ranged from 8 to 34%. Rotavirus was the agent most commonly observed (26 to 83%), followed by adenoviruses (8 to 27%, respiratory and enteric combined), and small round viruses (SRVs) (0 to 40%) which were second most common at two of the centers. Rotavirus and astrovirus detections occurred more often in the winter but seasonal trends in detection were not apparent for the other viruses. Of all astroviruses detected 64% were found in infants (less than 1 year); unlike the other agents studied SRVs were detected in a large percentage of infants (48%) and older children and adults (20%). Among hospitalized patients a majority of all astroviruses, caliciviruses and SRVs were detected 7 days or more after admission in contrast to both rotaviruses and adenoviruses which were more likely to be detected earlier. The data suggest that SRVs are common agents of gastroenteritis and may be important causes of nosocomial infections. Because of the relative insensitivity of direct electron microscopy as a screening method for SRVs, astroviruses and caliciviruses, these data probably underestimate the true prevalence of disease caused by these agents. 
High dietary linoleic acid affects the fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipids from tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): association with stress susceptibility and cardiac lesion. For 16 wk Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts were fed practical-type diets that contained either fish oil (FO) or sunflower oil (SO) as the lipid component. Both diets contained adequate (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress. 
Evaluation of the Ca2+ distribution in aortic tissue of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats [letter] In the present study, particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) was used to get information on the spatial distribution of Ca2+ in aortas of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive controls aged 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. To differentiate changes in Ca2+ metabolism in hypertensive arteries from secondary phenomena due to the arteriosclerosis, the animals were examined in the earliest stage of hypertension. It was found that the Ca2+ content was not elevated in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 1 week (n = 11), as compared to normotensive controls (n = 10) (186.8 +/- 89.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 254.0 +/- 173.3 micrograms Ca2+/g). The Ca2+ content was raised (P less than .05) in the aortic smooth muscle of SHR aged 4 weeks (n = 13), as compared to 12 WKY rats (4 weeks) (726.0 +/- 130.4 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 440.3 +/- 214.4 micrograms Ca2+/g) and in 17 SHR (3 months), as compared to 13 WKY rats, respectively (3390.1 +/- 729.9 micrograms Ca2+/g tissue v 1632.1 +/- 569.5 micrograms Ca2+/g). The results confirm the age-related increase in the arterial Ca2+ content in normotensive rats and demonstrate additionally that this age-related rise in arterial Ca2+ content is accelerated in SHR. 
Urinary calcium as an early marker for preeclampsia. Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy excrete less calcium than healthy pregnant women. Whether this reduction in calcium excretion precedes or follows hypertension is unknown. We prospectively measured urinary calcium excretion in 103 consecutive nulliparous women at risk for preeclampsia and presenting for prenatal care before 24 weeks' gestation. Serial 24-hour urine specimens were obtained at 10-24 weeks, 25-32 weeks, and 33 weeks to term. After delivery, the charts were reviewed for the presence of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. At the first collection, patients who later developed preeclampsia excreted less urinary calcium (169 +/- 30 mg/24 hours; mean +/- standard error of the mean) than those who remained normotensive (298 +/- 15 mg/24 hours) (P less than .05); this reduction persisted throughout gestation. Using a receiver operator curve, we calculated a predictive threshold calcium value for hypertension of 195 mg/24 hours. The difference in the incidence of preeclampsia between pregnant women with calcium excretion values at or below 195 mg/24 hours (87%, 95% confidence interval 52-98%) and those with values above that level (2%, confidence interval 0.3-8%) was highly significant (Fisher exact test, P less than .0001). The 95% lower limit of relative risk for preeclampsia in patients with a calcium excretion equal to or below 195 mg/24 hours in the first collection was 9.4. These observations suggest a pathophysiologic role for altered urinary calcium excretion in women with preeclampsia that may contribute to the early identification of patients at risk for this disease. 
Manometric and radiologic investigations and biofeedback treatment of chronic idiopathic anal pain. In 12 patients suffering from chronic idiopathic anal pain, the rectosphincteric function was studied using manometric and x-ray techniques. The results of manometric investigations were compared with those obtained in 12 healthy volunteers. In all patients, the resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly higher than in control subjects. In 10 patients, defecography revealed abnormalities of the pelvic muscles. We treated the patients by using biofeedback techniques, consisting of voluntary modifications of the state of contraction of the external sphincter. In all cases, pain disappeared after a mean of eight biofeedback training sessions. When noxious manifestations had disappeared, manometry showed a significant decrease in the anal canal resting pressure. Our results indicate 1) that chronic idiopathic anal pain is associated with abnormal anorectal manometric profiles, probably resulting from a dysfunctioning of the striated external anal sphincter, and 2) that biofeedback training is an effective treatment for chronic idiopathic anal pain. 
Pathophysiology and treatment of septic shock. The mortality from septic shock continues to range between 40% to 60% despite advances in cardiovascular support and antibiotic therapy. Impairment of host defenses predisposes to the development of both severe infection and septic shock. The activation of a myriad of cellular and plasma mediators by microbial toxins produces the systemic and metabolic manifestations of sepsis. The clinical presentation includes characteristic clinical, hemodynamic, and laboratory abnormalities. Multiple organ systems are involved during septic shock, with outcome dependent on the circulatory response and the development of sequential organ failures. Initial resuscitation is directed at restoring tissue perfusion with fluids and vasoactive drugs, guided by assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status. Identification of the site of infection and choice of appropriate antibiotics are critical to the success of therapy. Newer therapeutic modalities include immunologic interventions that attenuate mediator activity and modulate the immune response. Pharmacologic therapies are also being developed that are aimed at blocking the actions of specific mediators. 
Testing the psychogenic vomiting diagnosis. Four pediatric patients. We treated four patients with chronic vomiting during childhood in whom a tentative diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was made after an extensive evaluation. In each case, the diagnosis was reconsidered during the course of treatment, as observations about the patients and their response to interventions accumulated. In three instances, these observations did not fit those expected if the diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was correct. This led to a reexamination of the organic evaluation and the discovery of an undiagnosed organic contribution to the vomiting. In the fourth patient, gastric emptying studies confirmed that there was a strong psychological contribution to the vomiting, and helped to more carefully define this contribution. Family and individual psychotherapy and treatment were aided by the greater clarity in diagnosis. 
Anti-tumor effect of L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition with 5-fluorouracil administration on Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats. L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition (methionine-deprived TPN), infusing amino acid solution devoid of L-methionine and L-cysteine by the method of TPN as an only protein source, showed enhancement of the effect of several anti-cancer agents. In this study the combined effect of the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined in Yoshida Sarcoma (YS)-bearing rats, from aspects of effects on the tumor metastasis and the host animal's life span, in the following four groups treated with: methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU, methionine-deprived TPN without administration of 5-FU, L-methionine-contained TPN plus 5-FU, and L-methionine-contained TPN without 5-FU. In the first experiment, TPN was continued for 8 days in the four groups, and the anti-cancer effect of methionine-deprived TPN and administration of 5-FU based on both the growth of the primary tumor at the implanted site and the tumor metastasis was studied from the view point of pathologic findings of animals killed immediately after these treatments. In experiment 2 the survival period was examined after these treatments for 10 days with subsequent oral feeding until death. The results were as follows: proliferation of YS, transplanted subcutaneously, was markedly suppressed; particularly hematogenous metastasis, characteristic in YS, was prominently blunted then obtained an apparent longer survival period in rats treated with the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU. 
Regional cerebral blood flow correlates of language processes in reading disability. This series of studies tests the hypothesis of abnormal left hemisphere activation in reading-disabled subjects during language task performance. First, a left superotemporal focus of activation, as measured by regional cerebral blood flow, was found to be positively correlated with task accuracy in a group of 69 normal adults. Next, that left superotemporal activation was replicated in a second group of 83 adults whose childhood reading ability was known from standardized tests given in childhood. Finally, in that latter group, childhood reading ability was also found to be inversely correlated with focal activation in a more posterior, temporoparietal area of cortex. Adult reading outcome was statistically unrelated to this finding. The results are interpreted as suggesting a trait anomaly of left hemisphere cerebral activation in adults who were dyslexic as children and as providing an existence proof of individual differences in focal cortical activation sites during constant task demands. 
Role of postoperative radiation therapy in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer. One hundred forty-six patients with pathological stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether postoperative radiation therapy improves survival and reduces locoregional recurrences. The survival rate of the overall group at 1, 3, and 5 years was 56%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Regarding the type of resection and histology, we did not observe statistically significant differences. Patients with N0 and N1 disease were grouped and compared with the N2 group, and survival at 3 and 5 years was 41% and 27%, respectively, for the T3 N0-1 group and 17% and 15%, respectively, for the T3 N2 group (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively). Eighty-six patients received postoperative irradiation (45 to 50 Gy) and 60 did not. We have not observed any improvement in survival with postoperative radiation therapy, except in those patients with N2 disease. Median survival time was 6 months for patients without irradiation and 15 months for those with irradiation (p = 0.071). According to locoregional recurrences, a slight benefit with postoperative radiation therapy was observed. 
Accidental astemizole overdose in young children. 6 cases of accidental astemizole poisoning in children have been reported to the Finnish Poison Information Center. The children were aged 1 year 7 months to 3 years 4 months and had taken doses of 2.5 to 16.7 mg/kg, at least twelve times that recommended. In 2 children the overdose was verified by measurement of drug concentrations. Despite measures to prevent drug absorption prolonged QTc-interval, a sign of cardiac toxicity, was found in all 5 children on whom an electrocardiogram was available for analysis, and severe ventricular arrhythmias developed in 1. Young children with accidental astemizole overdose should be carefully monitored in hospital. Similar precautions may be justified in cases of overdose with other selective H1-histamine receptor antagonists. 
Serum amyloid A (SAA3) produced by rabbit synovial fibroblasts treated with phorbol esters or interleukin 1 induces synthesis of collagenase and is neutralized with specific antiserum. We report that nucleic acid sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone for a rabbit serum amyloid A (SAA)-like protein has identified this protein as more closely related to SAA3 than to SAA1. SAA3 induced collagenase synthesis in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, and immune IgG raised against this SAA protein abrogated the induction. Using antisera to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically labeled 3H-SAA and 3H-collagenase from culture medium, we compared the levels of SAA and collagenase synthesized by cultures of rabbit fibroblasts at early passage (passages 3-6) with those synthesized by late passage cells (passage 16). Comparatively high levels of both proteins were produced constitutively by fibroblasts at low passage. With increasing passage, levels of both proteins drop so that by passage 16, constitutive production of SAA and collagenase was only approximately 15-20% that of passage 3 cells. Cells at low passage could be readily stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or interleukin 1 (IL-1) to synthesize increased amounts of both SAA and collagenase. In passage 5 cells treated with PMA, we detected increased SAA mRNA by 1.5 h and collagenase mRNA by 5 h. However, older passage cells were more refractory to stimulation and required longer induction times. We suggest that SAA3 may be expressed by fibroblasts at sites of acute inflammation or injury, and that elevated levels of SAA3 may signify "activated" fibroblasts which are already producing increased amounts of collagenase constitutively and which are predisposed to further stimulation. 
Haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome: false positive reaction with a rotavirus latex agglutination test. A stool sample from a child with haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome gave a positive reaction with the RotaScreen latex agglutination test in the absence of other evidence of rotavirus infection. When this test is performed on bloody specimens, positive reactions should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by other means. 
Recurrent porokeratosis. A 63-year-old man developed linear, annular and accuminate lesions which showed the histological features of porokeratosis. The lesions cleared spontaneously, recurred several months later and ulcerated, then cleared again. The spontaneous resolution and recurrence of the lesions is a hitherto undescribed pattern of porokeratosis. 
Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia using immunoglobulin hypervariable region specific oligonucleotide probes. To develop a sensitive and specific assay for minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we exploited the enormous diversity of genomic sequences created by immune receptor gene rearrangements. To isolate clone-specific sequences, we first synthesized oligonucleotides that match conserved variable (VH) and joining (JH) sequences flanking the third hypervariable region (HVR3) in the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. In polymerase chain reactions (PCR), these primers were then used to amplify the intervening HVR3 segments from leukemic DNA samples. Of 12 B-lineage ALLs studied, ten generated one or more fragments of the size expected for HVR3 gene segments. Thus, this single pair of amplimers was sufficient to isolate HVR3 sequences from a majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To verify that the amplified fragments originated from HVR3 alleles and to assess their diversity, we sequenced 7 PCR products derived from 6 leukemias. In addition to elements of recognized D segments, each of the 7 fragments contained novel VH-D and D-JH junctional sequences, including N nucleotides, not known to be present in the germline. Each sequence was unique, and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized only to HVR3 segments from which the probes were derived. Therefore, as anticipated, these HVR3 segments appeared to possess the diversity required to serve as clonal markers for leukemic populations. To demonstrate that these amplified HVR3 alleles could serve as the basis for a sensitive and specific assay to detect rare leukemic cells, we analyzed in detail one pre-B leukemia that had rearranged 2 IgH alleles. The HVR3 sequences were shown to be linked to rearranged JH-containing restriction fragments in digests of genomic DNA, establishing their origin in the leukemic cells. We synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the unique junctional sequences in the HVR3 segments. Using these novel amplimers in an allele-specific amplification and hybridization procedure, we showed that this assay can detect 10 leukemic cells in a background of 10(6) normal blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, the leukemic HVR3 sequences were not detected in extracts of normal or unrelated remission leukemic leukocytes. We conclude that the assay for specific IgH HVR3 sequences is a realistic strategy for detection of minimal residual disease in B-lineage ALL. 
Beware of malignant lymphoma masquerading as facial inflammatory processes. Considerable difficulty exists in diagnosing some sarcomas, lymphomas, and carcinomas that develop in the head and neck. Frequently these malignancies appear clinically as masquerading inflammatory disease processes. Recognition of these rare lesions usually occurs only after the inflammatory-like symptoms have failed to respond to conventional management, necessitating a more extensive evaluation and even repeated biopsies. The use of special stains, immunohistochemical studies, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence techniques may still produce an inconclusive histopathologic diagnosis. This case report documents a rare extranodal malignant lymphoma of the right maxillary sinus that mimicked an odontogenic infection with superimposed chronic rhinosinusitis in a 19-year-old sailor. The cause of his chief complaint and presenting symptoms challenged the astuteness of clinicians, surgeons, and histopathologists on two continents and the high seas. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for malignancy when inflammatory-like lesions fail to respond to the usual appropriate management. Indications for early biopsy of suspect lesions and aggressive follow-up are emphasized. 
Treatment of primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome with ibuprofen and alprazolam. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures. This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology. The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam. An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures. These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS. 
Assessment of the extent of jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion in man using technetium-99m isonitrile imaging. We tested the feasibility of technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) imaging for delineating jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary occlusion and reperfusion in man. This new perfusion agent was injected in 25 patients during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a single-vessel left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. Distinct perfusion defects were present on "occlusion" images but not on "open vessel" images obtained 20 to 24 hours later in 21 patients (84%). The extent and severity of perfusion defects were significantly smaller in patients with distal versus proximal LAD occlusions (3.4 +/- 1.2 versus 5.2 +/- 1.5 segments; p less than 0.001). The only factor that was significantly related to the presence or absence of such "ischemic" perfusion defects was the absence or presence of visible collateral vessels to the LAD (p less than 0.03). The site of occlusion, presence of wall motion abnormalities, or occlusion time did not influence the results significantly. Thus the myocardial area at risk could be visualized and quantitated by Tc-MIBI imaging even after occlusion times as short as 15 seconds, but functioning collateral vessels are capable of protecting jeopardized myocardium in this setting. 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA on routine Papanicolaou's smears by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated probes. Specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of cervical neoplasias. HPV DNA types usually have been identified by nucleic acid hybridization assays with the use of radiolabeled probes. These techniques are sensitive and specific but are not suitable for large-scale clinical use. To detect specific HPV DNAs simply and rapidly, in situ hybridization (ISH) with the use of biotinylated HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 probes was done on destained Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears from 545 patients. All smears showed koilocytotic changes. HPV DNAs were demonstrated not only in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and atypia, but also in squamous cells with minimal nuclear changes (karyomegaly) and perinuclear halos. HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 52% of the smears with CIN I, 44% of those with CIN II and III, 19% of those with atypia, and 4% of the minimal changes. HPV DNA 6/11 was detected in 27% of the smears with CIN I, 27% of those with atypia, and 6% of the minimal changes. HPV DNAs were also detected in smears without koilocytotic changes. Thus, ISH with the use of biotinylated probes can serve as an adjunct to Pap smears in detecting HPV infection. 
Genotypic analysis of diffuse, mixed cell lymphomas. Comparison with morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. Malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type, as defined in the Working Formulation, is heterogeneous both morphologically and immunophenotypically and, in some cases, clonality may be difficult to determine. Because gene rearrangement analysis has been shown to be a sensitive method for determining clonality, the authors genotyped 20 cases and compared the results with histologic and immunophenotypic findings. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that all lesions were composed predominantly of T cells. In addition, in eight cases either a monoclonal B-cell population (five lesions) or an aberrant immunophenotype (two T, one B) was detected, supporting a malignant diagnosis. In seven of these eight lymphomas, genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of a population of clonal cells. One case with an abnormal T-cell phenotype was germline. In 12 cases the immunophenotypic results were uncertain (i.e., no clonal population or abnormal immunophenotype was identified). Genotypic analysis provided evidence of clonality in eight. In four cases with uncertain immunophenotypic results, a clonal population also could not be identified with the use of Southern blot analysis. Thus, the authors conclude that gene rearrangement analysis is a valuable tool in the study of diffuse mixed cell lymphomas and is complementary to immunophenotypic studies. In addition, the authors analyzed the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome 18, either by Southern blot analysis and/or with the polymerase chain reaction. The authors identified the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in seven B-cell lymphomas, five of which were not considered to be of follicular center cell type on the basis of morphologic findings. These results suggest that the histologic spectrum of follicular center cell lymphomas is greater than is appreciated in the literature. 
Pathological hypertrophy and cardiac interstitium. Fibrosis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major risk factor associated with myocardial failure. An explanation for why a presumptive adaptation such as LVH would prove pathological has been elusive. Insights into the impairment in contractility of the hypertrophied myocardium have been sought in the biochemistry of cardiac myocyte contraction. Equally compelling is a consideration of abnormalities in myocardial structure that impair organ contractile function while preserving myocyte contractility. For example, in the LVH that accompanies hypertension, the extracellular space is frequently the site of an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen. This reactive and progressive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and ultimately ventricular dysfunction and is likely a result of cardiac fibroblast growth and enhanced collagen synthesis. The disproportionate involvement of this nonmyocyte cell, however, is not a uniform accompaniment to myocyte hypertrophy and LVH, suggesting that the growth of myocyte and nonmyocyte cells is independent of each other. This has now been demonstrated in in vivo studies of experimental hypertension in which the abnormal fibrous tissue response was found in the hypertensive, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as in the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. These findings further suggest that a circulating substance that gained access to the common coronary circulation of the ventricles was involved. This hypothesis has been tested in various animal models in which plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were varied. Based on morphometric and morphological findings, it can be concluded that arterial hypertension (i.e., an elevation in coronary perfusion pressure) together with elevated circulating aldosterone are associated with cardiac fibroblast involvement and the resultant heterogeneity in tissue structure. Nonmyocyte cells of the cardiac interstitium represent an important determinant of pathological LVH. The mechanisms that invoke short- (e.g., collagen metabolism) and long-term (e.g., mitosis) responses of cardiac fibroblasts require further investigation and integration of in vitro with in vivo studies. The stage is set, however, to prevent pathological LVH resulting from myocardial fibrosis as well as to reverse it. 
Age-related complications and optimal choice of artificial heart valves in elderly patients. The use of bioprosthetic heart valves in elderly patients is presently advocated by many since implanting mechanical valves are considered to result in unacceptable rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. However the somewhat limited durability of bioprostheses has to be acknowledged since a group of elderly patients will eventually require a reoperation due to tissue failure. We have evaluated our policy to implant mechanical heart valve prostheses even in elderly patients based on the conception that we believe that anticoagulation in this group of patients can be handled with a low rate of complications. 
Needle electromyographic evaluation of patients with myofascial or fibromyalgic pain. Several past studies have evaluated the electromyographic activity of myofascial trigger points with conflicting results. This study was performed to determine whether spontaneous activity or motor unit activity was present in patients with focal myofascial pain or fibromyalgia. Using routine needle electromyographic techniques, we sampled reproducibly tender focal areas (tender points), similar tender areas with pain referral (trigger points), associated muscle bands and adjacent uninvolved musculature. Twenty-five subjects (14 females, 11 males, mean +/- SD age 43 +/- 14 years) were studied; twenty-one subjects with focal myofascial pain and four with fibromyalgia. Spontaneous fibrillatory or positive sharp wave potentials were not found in any muscle in the 25 subjects. There was no evidence of focal motor unit activity in the tender points, trigger points or associated muscle bands in either group. Motor unit recruitment was similar in all areas sampled. We conclude that no electrodiagnostic evidence of ongoing denervation or focal muscle spasm is found in association with focal myofascial pain or fibromyalgia. 
Lymphocytic hypophysitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Report of a case. Lymphocytic hypophysitis is one of the causes of hypopituitarism in the postpartum period. Some of these patients have been reported to have other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and the disease is considered to be autoimmune in nature. The authors describe a unique case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in a young woman. She had hemianopia that developed three days after delivery. Computed tomography scans revealed an intrasellar mass lesion. Secretions of adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone were decreased. Although no organ-specific autoantibodies were detected in her serum, OKT4-positive helper T lymphocytes were increased in peripheral blood. Pituitary biopsy at craniotomy showed typical features of lymphocytic hypophysitis. Pulmonary and eye sarcoidosis developed 11 months after the delivery. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first case of lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with sarcoidosis in other organs. 
Deregulation of a homeobox gene, HOX11, by the t(10;14) in T cell leukemia. Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene. 
Why don't all heavy snorers have obstructive sleep apnea? Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heavy snorers without apnea both show intrathoracic suction pressures during sleep that exceed their static upper airway closing pressures. Complete airway occlusion, however, occurs only in the former patient group. We hypothesized that the kinetic properties of the airflow would be different in these two types of patients because of differences in upper airway morphology. The pharyngeal computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional areas of the upper airways in 15 patients with OSA, 25 nonapneic heavy snorers, and 14 control subjects while they were awake. Nocturnal breathing was monitored with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB). The patients with OSA had a narrower airspace at the velopharyngeal (VP) level than the controls (p less than 0.01); the nonapneic snorers did not differ from the other groups. At the tongue base (TB) and the hyoid bone (HB) levels there was no difference between the OSA and the control groups, but the nonapneic snorers had narrower airways at both of these levels compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01) and at the hyoid bone level compared with the OSA group (p less than 0.05). The VP/HB ratio was the parameter that best distinguished the patients with OSA from the nonapneic snorers (lower in the OSA group, p less than 0.001). We suggest that airway collapse during sleep is favored by a narrow velopharynx associated with large hypopharynx. Some heavy snorers may not have an oropharyngeal collapse because the peak inspiratory suction pressure could already be damped down at the level of the relatively narrow hypopharyngeal airways. 
Risk factors for second cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive systems: a case-control study. A case-control study of determinants of multiple cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive system (URDS) was conducted using a patient cohort-nested design. We analyzed demographic and risk factor information and clinical variables related to the index cancer for 85 cases of multiple cancers and 170 controls matched on sub-site of the index cancer of the case and date of hospital admission. Follow-up information for the control group was used to infer the person-years-at-risk for the cohort of 1977 patients. URDS cancer patients experienced a 10.7 times (95% confidence interval: 8.5-13.2) higher risk of additional related cancers than the general population. Although controls had cancers of the same sites as those of cases and thus, strongly tobacco and alcohol-related, there were marked residual effects for these two risks factors. In addition, characteristics related to the extension and clinical course of the index cancer were strongly associated with the patient's risk of developing additional cancers. 
Reduction of rattlesnake-venom-induced myonecrosis in mice by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) at 1, 2, and 2.75 atmospheres absolute (ATA) was used to treat rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom-induced tissue damage and edema in thigh muscles of mice. Tissue damage was evaluated by double-blind histopathologic examination: tissue edema was determined by measuring tissue water content. A total of 10 intermittent exposures to oxygen over a period of 4 days at 2 and 2.75 ATA did not influence the resolution of venom-induced tissue edema, whereas tissue damage was significantly ameliorated as compared to air-treated envenomated controls. HBOT also promoted healing in the venom-injected mice as evidenced by the presence of regenerating muscle cells. It is concluded that HBOT may limit rattlesnake venom-induced myonecrosis and promote healing in a dose-response relationship without reducing venom-induced edema. 
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support in the high-risk cardiac patient undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery. Patients with a recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, sever angina, or uncorrected multivessel coronary artery disease are at increased risk of cardiac complications after major noncardiac surgery. Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high. We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery. There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place. There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed. One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery. 
Effect of recirculation on exacerbation of ischemic vascular lesions in rat brain. Using electron microscopy, we investigated the small arteries and veins in ischemic lesions induced by occlusion of the ostium of the middle cerebral artery in 42 rats. We observed endothelial denudation in the small arteries of rats receiving occlusion for greater than 6 hours. When the occluding cylinder was removed to allow for reperfusion, however, 2 hours of occlusion was sufficient for endothelial denudation to occur. Medial smooth muscle cells seemed to be more vulnerable to ischemia than endothelial cells because ultrastructural changes in the former cells preceded endothelial denudation. Moreover, endothelial denudation definitely exacerbated vascular changes so that medial necrosis appeared to be complete beneath the denuded areas, allowing erythrocytes, platelets, and exogenous tracers to penetrate into the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells. These arterial lesions seemed to be repaired 10 days after removal of the occluding cylinder following 2 hours of occlusion. On the other hand, small veins in the ischemic lesion did not show endothelial denudation or medial necrosis. Our study suggests that arterial changes in ischemic lesions play a role in exacerbating the brain edema caused by recirculation after ischemia. 
Cigarette smoking and flap and full-thickness graft necrosis. The association between cigarette smoking and necrosis of flaps and full-thickness grafts was analyzed in 220 patients. Review of a series of 916 flaps and full-thickness grafts revealed 44 patients in whom some degree of tissue necrosis occurred. These patients with necrosis were age and gender matched with 176 controls randomly selected from the remaining 872 patients. Current high-level smokers, that is those smoking one or more packs per day, had necrosis develop approximately three times more frequently than never smokers, low-level smokers (less than one pack per day), or former smokers (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.2). Former smokers (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 3.2) and low-level smokers (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.1) were at a negligible increased risk for necrosis that was not significantly different from never smokers. Once tissue necrosis developed, the median percent of the visible flap or graft tissue that necrosed was approximately threefold greater among current smokers (regardless of the number of packs per day smoked) than never smokers. 
Claudication: an unusual side effect of DHE administration. DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine. The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety. DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation. The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine. There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE. This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE. Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE. Recovery was complete. 
Antigenic differences between the endometrium of women with and without endometriosis. Serum and peritoneal fluid from 12 women with endometriosis, 4 women with uterine leiomyomata and 6 fertile women without endometriosis (controls) and serum from 4 women with adenomyosis were tested with a passive hemagglutination assay for antibodies against endometrium from all the controls, 8 patients with endometriosis and all patients with uterine leiomyomata and from implants from 8 patients with endometriosis. Serum antibody titers in patients with endometriosis or leiomyomata were significantly higher against endometrial or implant antigens from patients with endometriosis and 2 patients with leiomyomata than those against the controls' endometrium. Peritoneal fluid endometrial antibody titers failed to reflect these antigenic differences. Controls and patients with adenomyosis had low titers of endometrial antibodies in their serum or peritoneal fluid. Antigenic differences appear to exist between the endometrium of patients with endometriosis and that of controls. 
Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not alter serum transaminases and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in homosexual patients with chronic HBV infection. The influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is controversial. We followed a cohort of 64 homosexual men with persistent HBs antigenemia for a median of 24 months in the hepatitis clinic of a large urban public hospital. We divided the patients into three groups according to their immune status. Group 1 (n = 13) consisted of HIV-seropositive men with evidence of immunosuppression; group 2 (n = 17), HIV-positive patients without evidence of immunosuppression; and group 3 (n = 34), HIV-negative patients. We followed serum ALT and HBV DNA determinations. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the three groups. Group 1 had significantly lower levels of circulating T4 lymphocytes. We found no differences in the number and severity of episodes of HBV reactivation, serum ALT levels, or HBV DNA scores among the three groups. In each group, the percentage of patients with circulating HBV DNA was the same. We conclude that HIV infection apparently does not influence the markers of liver inflammation or HBV replication in homosexual men. 
Ossification of the cervical ligamentum flavum. A case of a 61-year-old man with ossification of the cervical ligamentum flavum is reported. The ossification was located on the left side of C3-4. The symptoms improved with laminectomy and resection. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum usually occurs in the lower thoracic spine, and is rare in the cervical region. Including the present one, only eight cases have been reported to our knowledge. The clinical features and pathogenesis are discussed. 
Revision total hip arthroplasty for aseptic failure. A review of 276 cases. The results of 276 cemented revision total hip arthroplasties performed for aseptic failure between 1977 and 1986 have been reviewed. The mean time between revision and review was 75 months (range 30 to 144). Of 220 cases available for review, 159 were assessed clinically and radiographically, and 32 by postal questionnaire. Eighteen hips required further revision, 12 for loosening, two for sepsis, two for persistent pain, and one each for fracture and recurrent dislocation. A further six hips were radiologically and symptomatically loose. Pain was mild or absent in 83%. Over half were able to walk a mile or more; 70% flexed more than 70 degrees; 15% had a flexion deformity, but in only 7% was this more than 10 degrees. The mean Harris hip score was 74. Survival at five years was 95% and at 10 years, 77%. 
Acute sternal opening after cardiac surgery in children: effect on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was measured immediately before and 15 minutes after re-opening of the sternotomy and delayed sternal closure were performed to alleviate possible myocardial compression in 3 children. As acute re-opening of the sternotomy is a rare occurrence our sample size was necessarily small. ANP increased following the procedure in all 3 patients, and this was significant (p less than 0.02) when compared to plasma levels obtained from 9 children who underwent sternotomy prior to elective cardiac surgery. Following acute re-opening of the sternotomy there was an increase in median urine output and a decrease in median central venous pressure. Our results illustrate that it is atrial wall stress rather than intra-atrial pressure that determines release of ANP, and in addition suggest ANP may be a factor in the rapid clinical improvement following delayed sternal closure for atypical tamponade in children. 
Eosinophil-induced chronic active hepatitis in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. A 19-yr-old man had features of chronic hepatitis with piecemeal necrosis as the sole clinical feature of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Liver biopsy specimens demonstrated the presence of activated eosinophils and, by immunohistochemical staining, major basic protein in areas of hepatic cell damage. The case demonstrates the clinical presentation of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as chronic hepatitis and the association between eosinophil infiltration and degranulation with the presence of hepatocyte necrosis. 
Clinical follow-up and immunogenetic studies of 32 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome 31 patients with L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) that developed during the United States outbreak in 1989 were followed up prospectively at a university hospital outpatient rheumatology clinic for 16 to 24 months from the onset of their illness. Another patient with EMS associated with L-tryptophan in 1988 was followed up for 30 months. 93% of the 28 survivors from the 1989 cohort continue to have symptoms affecting 1-4 organ systems (median 3) and 3 have died, so the disorder produces considerable morbidity and mortality. The chronic sequelae most often associated with long-term disability are sclerodermatous skin thickening (54%), sensorimotor polyneuropathy (61%), proximal myopathy (36%), and severe episodic myalgias (64%). Thrombocytopenia developed in 1 patient. HLA-class II typing revealed a non-significant trend towards an association with HLA-DR4. Early therapy with corticosteroids did not seem to prevent the development of chronic manifestations. 
Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. 
Effects of acute, graded compression on spinal nerve root function and structure. An experimental study of the pig cauda equina. A well-controlled experimental model for analysis of compression-induced functional changes of the porcine cauda equina is presented. The model allows for electrophysiologic investigation of a variety of neurophysiologic changes induced by nerve root deformation. At an acute pressure threshold of 50-75 mm Hg, changes in both afferent and efferent conduction are induced. With higher compression pressure, a differential recovery in afferent and efferent conduction is seen. 
Risk of recurrence after myomectomy. The risk of recurrence of uterine myomas was analyzed in 622 patients who underwent myomectomy between 1970 and 1984 at the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Milan. The cumulative 10-year recurrence rate was 27%, and this increased steadily up to the end of the observation period. Differences were not observed in frequency of recurrence by age at diagnoses or by the site of the myomas at surgery. Patients with a single myoma tended to experience a lower rate, but this finding was not statistically significant. Women who gave birth to a child after myomectomy had a 10-year recurrence rate of 15%, against 30% for those who did not; this difference was statistically significant. 
Recurrence after radiotherapy for glottic carcinoma. A series of 478 patients with T1-3N0 glottic carcinoma treated by irradiation is presented. Of these patients, 320 were previously untreated, whereas 158 patients were referred for treatment of a recurrence after receiving radiotherapy elsewhere. The primary recurrence rate in the previously untreated patients was 10%. The rate was higher in T2 and T3 tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and in patients who were in poor general condition. Over 80% of the recurrent tumors were Stage pT3 or pT4, whereas 12% of total laryngectomy specimens showed necrosis only with no evidence of tumor. The necrosis rate in previously untreated patients was 1% for T1 tumors, 4% for T2 tumors, and 3% for T3 tumors. Of all tumors, 60% were transglottic when they recurred, whereas only 29% were confined to the glottis at recurrence. Histologic diagnosis had a high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that a negative histologic report is unreliable. Of patients with a recurrent primary tumor, 13% were untreatable. The 5-year survival after a primary recurrence was 39%, and the main prognostic factors were sex, T stage at recurrence, and time to recurrence. Of patients available for follow-up at 5 years 49% were alive with a larynx, 5% were alive without a larynx, 13% were dead of the original cancer, and 33% had died of other causes. In those suffering a primary recurrence, the commonest cause of death was a subsequent lymph node metastasis, followed in order of frequency by stomal recurrence and recurrence in the pharyngeal remnant. The hospital mortality rate after laryngectomy was 3%, and 30% of patients undergoing laryngectomy developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The recurrence rate in lymph nodes was 14% at 5 years, general condition and T stage being the only significant predictors of recurrence. Only 17% of patients had small (N1) nodes by the time the diagnosis of cervical lymph node recurrence was made, and 27% of all patients were unsuitable for treatment. Host, tumor factors, and time to recurrence were not significant predictors of survival after node recurrence. The survival rate 5 years after node recurrence was 16%, and the main cause of death in those who died was uncontrolled disease in the neck. The hospital mortality after salvage neck dissection was 4.7%. 
Increased Na(+)-H+ exchange in jejunal brush border membrane vesicles of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The spontaneously hypertensive rats and their genetically matched controls, Wistar-Kyoto, serve as models of essential hypertension. The present study was undertaken to determine whether brush border membrane vesicles obtained from jejunal enterocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats show increased Na(+)-H+ exchange as part of a generalized membrane disorder. Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from the jejunum of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats using an Mg2+/ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid precipitation method. Uptake of 22Na by these vesicles was found to be into an osmotically sensitive intravesicular space rather than mere binding. Initial Na+ uptake by brush border membrane vesicles was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (P less than 0.05). Higher total and amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake in spontaneously hypertensive rats occurred in the presence of an outwardly directed pH gradient, and uptake became statistically similar to that of Wistar-Kyoto rats in the absence of a pH gradient. Moreover, amiloride-insensitive Na+ uptake under an outwardly directed pH gradient did not differ significantly between the two groups. The enhanced Na(+)-H+ activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats is not due to altered membrane permeability to protons, as is shown by acridine orange-quenching studies. Kinetic studies for amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake showed a greater Vmax in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (1.46 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.08 nmol.mg protein-1.7 s-1) but the Km values were similar in the two groups. These finding, along with similar findings previously reported in vascular smooth muscle and renal tissue of SHR, strongly suggest that an increased Na(+)-H+ exchange is related to the development of hypertension. 
Changes in lipids and lipoproteins with long-term estrogen deficiency and hormone replacement therapy. Cross-sectional data of the long-term effects of estrogens, androgens, and progestogens on lipids and lipoproteins were obtained in 556 postmenopausal women aged 24 to 85 years with follow-up for 1 to 44 years. Baseline values were obtained in 155 women from less than 1 year up to 30 years after menopause. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol tended to rise during the early postmenopausal years while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. Triglycerides were related to weight and were significantly different only between untreated women of normal weight (128.3 +/- 7.80 mg/dl) and hormone users weighing greater than 200 pounds (252.9 +/- 9.44 mg/dl), p less than or equal to 0.001. Although mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower with both C-21 progestogens (64.5 +/- 4.16 mg/dl) and C-19 progestogens (61.9 +/- 3.84 mg/dl), there were no statistically significant differences on comparison with levels in the unopposed estrogen users (67.0 +/- 3.94 mg/dl). Smoking significantly depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both hormone users (p less than or equal to 0.001) and untreated women (p less than or equal to 0.001). Added progestogens do not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins over the long term when adequate dosages of estrogens are used. 
On pain mechanisms in cluster headache. Various possible pathophysiological mechanisms to explain the pain in cluster headache are reviewed. Several locations for the initiation of pain along the primary afferent pathways in cranial nerves are discussed, together with the local mechanisms that might be responsible. These include neurogenic inflammation of large cranial vessels, irritation of vascular pain fibres by compression of dilated vessels in bony canals, and irritative foci in or around cranial sensory ganglia. In particular, recent neuroanatomical and pharmacological findings on nociceptive innervation of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery are commented upon. The possibilities for referred pain to explain the location of pain is illustrated. Evidence for involvement of central pain modulatory systems in the pain production is discussed. Finally a synthesis is made of the probable peripheral and central pain mechanisms in the disease. 
Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring: the most useful test for evaluating noncardiac chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic capabilities of traditional esophageal tests (manometry and provocative testing with acid and edrophonium) and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in identifying an esophageal cause of chest pain. DESIGN: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients referred by cardiologists to the esophageal laboratory for evaluation of esophageal causes of chest pain. SETTING: Tertiary-referral university hospital. METHODS: Esophageal manometry performed with 10 wet swallows of water. Acid perfusion (0.1 N hydrochloric acid) and edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg intravenously) tests were placebo-controlled with a positive study defined as replication of typical chest pain. Esophageal pH monitoring identified (1) abnormal acid exposure times in the upright, supine, or combined position, and (2) correlation between symptoms and acid reflux, i.e., symptom index. The esophagus was identified as "probably" contributing to chest pain only if the acid or edrophonium test was positive or if there was a positive correlation between symptoms and acid reflux during pH monitoring. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 32 patients (32%), but patients were asymptomatic during the study. The acid perfusion test was positive in 18 of 95 patients (19%), and the edrophonium test was positive in 15 of 78 patients (19%). Abnormal acid exposure times were found in 48 patients (48%). Of the 83 patients with spontaneous chest pain during 24-hour pH testing, 37 patients (46%) had abnormal reflux parameters and 50 patients (60%) had a positive symptom index (mean positive score 56%, range 6% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux is a common and potentially treatable cause of noncardiac chest pain. Traditional esophageal tests usually miss this diagnosis. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom correlation is the single best test for evaluating patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
Long-term diet modification and platelet activity. Platelet activity was assessed in a sub-sample of 56 participants in the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART). Men whose diets contained a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (a P:S ratio of greater than 0.5) showed reduced secondary platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and diminished platelet aggregation to ADP in whole blood. A trend of reduced secondary platelet aggregation to ADP with increasing dietary eicosapentaenoic acid was noted, but this was not statistically significant. The results of this study and the MRC Diet and Reinfarction Trial suggest a mediatory role for platelet activity in the relationship between diet and ischaemic heart disease. 
An immunohistochemical study of sarcomatoid liver carcinomas. Six cases of primary hepatic carcinomas with a significant amount of sarcomatoid elements were examined by using immunohistochemical stainings. Four of the six cases were associated with ordinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one with cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), and one with mixed HCC and CCC. Alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-1-antitrypsin were negative in sarcomatoid cells of all cases; vimentin stained positively in sarcomatoid tumor cells in two of the six cases; and cytokeratin (CK8) was detected in five cases. The CK8 was not detected in tumor cells of two cases of hepatic angiosarcoma, two of metastatic leiomyosarcomas, and one of metastatic fibrosarcoma, although vimentin stained positively in all these true sarcomas. It was concluded that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of liver carcinomas might derive from both HCC and CCC. In addition CK8 might be an excellent marker to make a differential diagnosis of sarcomatoid cancers from true metastatic or primary sarcomas of the liver. 
Radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility: results in 170 patients with chest pain. The role of radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with chest pain has been studied rarely. Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain. Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%). Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56). Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis. Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18. Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent. However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation. 
Relapsing transverse myelitis. Acute transverse myelitis is a monophasic disorder, the recurrence of which raises the question of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other multifocal CNS disease. We now report three patients with a previously undescribed syndrome of relapsing isolated acute transverse myelitis. Each had two to five attacks over periods of 3 to 8 years, characterized by ascending paresthesias, urinary retention, sensory loss with a thoracic or cervical level, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. MRI demonstrated areas of increased signal intensity on T2- and proton density-weighted scans and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighed scans of the cervical or thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory or demyelinating process. All patients had normal complete myelograms, oligoclonal IgG bands were consistently absent from the cerebrospinal fluid, cranial MRIs were normal, and there was no other clinical or laboratory evidence of MS, collagen-vascular disease, or active viral infection. They were treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, stabilized between episodes, and had partial or complete recovery. The recognition of these three patients at a single medical center in a 1-year period suggests that relapses of acute transverse myelitis may not be rare. 
Transfer from ophthalmology to another service is a marker of high risk medical events. Of 3632 consecutive admissions to the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, 27 patients required transfer to a medical or surgical service (0.74%). The major reasons for transfer included acute or decompensated cardiac disease (26%), poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (19%), acute renal failure (11%), coagulopathy, stroke, and hypertension (7% each). Only one transfer was a direct result of an anesthesia complication. The highest rates of transfers were associated with orbital (4.3%), enucleation/evisceration (3.1%), and glaucoma (2.3%) surgeries, while vitreoretinal surgery had the lowest rate of transfer (0.3%). Most of the transfers of patients with orbital disease were for management of related problems such as sinusitis or increased intracranial pressure. 
New pathologic observations in juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia. A patient with hereditary juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia died at age 39. There were Lewy bodies and regionally selective neuronal damage in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These changes closely resemble those seen in Parkinson's disease, and emphasize the selective vulnerability of the ventral tier of the pars compacta in these degenerations. 
Kindling as a model of drug-resistant partial epilepsy: selection of phenytoin-resistant and nonresistant rats. Complex partial seizures comprise the major uncontrolled seizure type in adult patients with epilepsy. Any improvement of our understanding of the mechanisms through which these seizures are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs is therefore of considerable importance. By examining the effects of the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin in a large group of kindled rats, a widely used model of complex partial seizures, animals with different sensitivity to this drug were selected. Using determination of the focal seizure threshold for evaluation of phenytoin's anticonvulsant effect, most animals (about 60%) showed variable effects in response to phenytoin. However, about 20% of the animals ("phenytoin nonresponders") showed no increase in their focal seizure threshold at repeated test trials with phenytoin, and 20% ("phenytoin responders") exhibited reproducible increases in focal seizure threshold after injection of phenytoin. Phenytoin responders and nonresponders thus selected were used for subsequent experiments. The different response of focal seizures to phenytoin was not related to differences in pharmacokinetics or location of the stimulating electrode. Although phenytoin reproducibly increased the threshold for induction of afterdischarges in responders, it did not alter severity or duration of the elicited seizure response. In contrast to phenytoin, carbamazepine induced increases in focal seizure threshold in all kindled rats. Duration of seizures and afterdischarges were significantly reduced by carbamazepine in phenytoin responders, but not in nonresponders, although plasma levels of carbamazepine were the same in both groups. The difference in response of kindled rats to phenytoin was restricted to kindled seizures, because phenytoin induced the same anticonvulsant effect on the threshold for generalized tonic electroconvulsions (determined via transauricular electrodes) in both groups of kindled rats. 
Xanthoma disseminatum: a case with extensive mucous membrane involvement. A 37-year-old man had red or brownish papules on his face, chest, and groin, where they coalesced into plaques. Endoscopic examination revealed the presence of small xanthomatous papules on the mucous membrane of the stomach. A biopsy specimen revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytes, foam cells, Touton giant cells, and inflammatory cells. The diagnosis of non-X histiocytosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies of the infiltrate. 
Rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis following intravenous vasopressin infusion. A continuous IV infusion of vasopressin was administrated to a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices. In the first 24 hours, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis. Stopping vasopressin infusion resulted in relief of these lesions. The rarity of these complications suggests an idiosyncratic reaction of susceptible individuals that may be related to previous vascular disease or a failure in baroreceptor regulation. 
Detection of ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors: MR imaging vs CT. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors tend to occur in the middle third of the lung adjacent to pulmonary vessels. Because they cause signs and symptoms when quite small (by virtue of their ACTH production), they may not be detected by CT. MR imaging was performed in 10 consecutive patients with surgically proved ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors in order to test the ability of MR to clarify equivocal or indeterminate findings on CT examinations. All bronchial carcinoid tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted and short-inversion-time inversion-recovery images, facilitating their distinction from pulmonary vasculature. In eight patients, the CT and MR images were equivalent in the detection of bronchial carcinoid tumors. In two patients, MR showed tumors in the middle third of the lung that were equivocal on CT. MR imaging may distinguish small bronchial carcinoid tumors from adjacent pulmonary vessels in the central third of the lung at a time when the CT study is nondiagnostic or equivocal. 
The hemodynamic response to hemorrhage in tumor-bearing animals. Tumor-bearing rats submitted to hypovolemia have higher mortality rates than have non-tumor-bearing control rats. To determine the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity to hemorrhage, we studied Fischer-344 rats with subcutaneous methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (tumor burden, 10% body weight) to determine hematologic and blood volume alterations. Subsequently we used the same animal model in an unanesthetized condition to determine the sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation, as well as vascular responsiveness to vasoactive agents. The rats were separated into two groups: control and tumor-bearing rats (TBR). Sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation was determined by bleeding the conscious rats (15 ml/kg) and resuscitating them with 0.9% NaCl (45 ml/kg). Vascular responsiveness was determined after injection of varying doses of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin, with continuous measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rate of increase of MAP, maximum MAP, relative increase in MAP (maximum minus baseline), rate of recovery toward baseline MAP, and duration of the response were determined. There was a significant anemia in TBR, but blood volume was similar in both groups. Baseline MAP was significantly higher in control rats (125.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) compared with TBR (107.5 +/- 6.0 mm Hg). After hemorrhage, MAP in TBR reached significantly lower levels than in control rats. In addition, after saline resuscitation, MAP in TBR did not return to baseline levels, whereas MAP in control rats returned to prehemorrhage MAP. With nitroglycerin, MAP decreased to lower levels in TBR than in control rats. With phenylephrine, the maximum MAP reached was significantly higher, and the response to phenylephrine was maintained for a significantly longer period in control rats compared with TBR. We conclude that TBR are more sensitive to hypovolemic events in association with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, profound hypotension, and altered overall vascular responsiveness to sympathetic stimuli. 
Effect of infarct location on myocardial salvage assessed by technetium-99m isonitrile. To investigate the influence of infarct location on myocardial salvage, technetium-99m isonitrile was injected into 43 patients with a first myocardial infarction before early reperfusion therapy. Primary coronary angioplasty was performed in 22 patients and successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was given to 15 patients, both within 6 h of the onset of chest pain. Patency of the infarct-related artery was confirmed by angiography in all 37 patients. In the remaining six patients (three with and three without early thrombolytic therapy) the infarct-related artery remained occluded. Single photon emission computed tomography was performed within 6 h of the administration of technetium-99m isonitrile and repeated at the time of hospital discharge. Radionuclide ejection fraction at discharge was significantly lower for patients with anterior infarction (0.41 +/- 0.12) than for those with inferior infarction (0.56 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). Early perfusion defect size, a measure of myocardium at risk, was greater in patients with anterior than in those with inferior infarction (52 +/- 9% vs. 18 +/- 10% of the left ventricle, p = 0.0001) as was final defect size (30 +/- 20% vs. 9 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01). The change in myocardial perfusion, an estimate of myocardial salvage, was also greater in patients with anterior infarction (24 +/- 16% vs. 10 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01). However, the proportion of jeopardized myocardium salvaged (salvage index) was not significantly different between patients with anterior or inferior infarction (0.49 +/- 0.34 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.35, p = NS). 
Comparative clinical trial of standard operative tracheostomy with percutaneous tracheostomy. OBJECTIVE: To compare percutaneous tracheostomy with conventional operative tracheostomy. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: The medical and surgical critical care units of a large, tertiary-care, private hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five male and 21 female translaryngeally intubated patients with respiratory failure, in whom tracheostomy was indicated on clinical grounds, were randomly assigned to one of two groups. INTERVENTIONS: The 24 patients in group 1 underwent conventional operative tracheostomy, and the 22 patients in group 2 underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. One patient in group 2 required tracheostomy on three separate occasions during a prolonged hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were examined daily throughout their hospital stays for adverse events related to the tracheostomy. In all patients who survived until decannulation, plain tomography of the trachea was performed within 3 days of decannulation. Repeat physical and tomographic examinations were performed 6 and 12 wks later. Fifty-eight percent (14/24) of the operative tracheostomies were associated with at least one complication, compared with 25% (6/24) of the percutaneous tracheostomies (p less than .05, 95% confidence interval 7% to 59%). Predecannulation problems were more frequent in group 1 patients than in group 2 (46% vs. 13%, respectively; p less than .01, 95% confidence interval 9% to 57%), as were later sequelae (88% vs. 27%; p less than .05, confidence interval 26% to 96%) in survivors. Group 1 patients were more likely to have multiple complications, and their complications tended to be more serious. CONCLUSION: In this study, percutaneous tracheostomy appeared to be superior to the conventional operation. 
Generalized pustulation as a manifestation of the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. BACKGROUND.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by the development of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatitis, and is associated with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. This article describes the unusual development of a follicular pustular eruption in two patients as a manifestation of this syndrome. OBSERVATIONS.-This pustular eruption most commonly develops on the face and scalp but may subsequently become generalized. While cultures of the pustules are negative, biopsy specimens reveal a dilated follicular infundibulum filled with neutrophils. Recognition of cutaneous pustulation as a potential manifestation of this syndrome is important, as a generalized pustular eruption developing in a febrile patient can easily be confused with an infectious process. CONCLUSIONS.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome may present with a follicular pustular eruption rather than the more commonly associated macular or papular rash or erythroderma. The three most commonly used anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can each produce an identical hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, in vitro testing has demonstrated that approximately 80% of patients tested to all three medications had positive reactions to each. Furthermore, with in vitro testing researchers are able to predict which anticonvulsants are safe to use, thereby allowing for prospective individualization of therapy. However, this technology is not yet available for widespread use. 
Solid and cystic pancreatic tumors. Clinical, histochemical, and electron microscopic features in ten cases. Ten cases of the rare solid and cystic pancreatic tumors are presented. All except one occurred in young women (mean age, 25 +/- 9.2 years). The large neoplasms were evenly distributed across the pancreas; in one case, metastasis occurred; all other cases were free from disease after complete resection. Histologic hallmarks of solid and cystic neoplasms were papillary growth, large intracytoplasmic granules, and immunoreactivity with alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, phospholipase A2, and neuroendocrine markers (neuron-specific enolase [NSE], synaptophysin). This suggests both endocrine as well as exocrine differentiation. 
Transesophageal echocardiography. Preliminary results in patients with traumatic aortic rupture. Eleven patients with blunt chest trauma at risk for traumatic aortic rupture underwent transesophageal echocardiography to image the descending aorta. Diagnoses were compared with the results of radiographic studies. Ten of the 11 patients underwent arch aortography, with positive results in six cases. In one patient, the results of a computed tomographic scan were interpreted as consistent with aortic rupture. The results of transesophageal echocardiography were positive for ruptured descending aorta in three of six patients with positive aortographic findings, and negative in eight patients. All three patients with positive findings had the diagnosis of ruptured descending aorta confirmed at surgery. The remaining eight patients demonstrated no aortic morbidity. These preliminary findings suggest that transesophageal echocardiography is a useful technique for the diagnosis of ruptured descending aorta following blunt chest trauma. 
Allergic fungal sinusitis: problems in diagnosis and treatment. Although first described in 1983, allergic Aspergillus sinusitis (AAS) has yet to gain wide recognition among otolaryngologists and pathologists. We have treated three patients with a history of asthma, nasal polyposis, and recurrent pansinusitis who fit the description of allergic Aspergillus sinusitis. Histopathologically, mucinous material with abundant eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals ("allergic mucin") is interspersed with fungal hyphae. Immunologic characteristics include serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) elevation, increased RAST classes, and cutaneous reactivity to molds. A retrospective analysis of the histopathology of 82 patients with chronic sinusitis was also undertaken. Eleven additional patients with classic allergic mucin were identified, but were found to be without evidence of fungal elements. The clinical features of all 14 patients are reviewed revealing the spectrum of disease. The difficulties of diagnosis and a therapeutic protocol which includes wide local debridement and postoperative use of systemic steroids are discussed. 
The use of albumin in clinical practice. The use of albumin in the clinical setting continues to generate controversy. Periodic shortages and the high cost of albumin have compelled many hospitals to develop guidelines regarding albumin administration. Our purpose is to review the human studies involving albumin. Particular emphasis will be placed on comparative trials involving albumin and the less expensive crystalloid solutions. It is hoped that this review will assist the clinician in making judgements concerning the appropriate use of albumin. 
Intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve function in cerebellopontine angle surgery. Facial nerve paralysis associated with cerebellopontine angle surgery has been reported to range up to 26% in a recent series. Various methods of intraoperatively monitoring the facial nerve have been developed to reduce the incidence of facial paralysis. We report our experience with an intraoperative monitoring technique using intramuscular EMG electrodes to detect subclinical electrical responses that were amplified and made audible to the operating surgeon after gating stimulus artifacts. A 3.6% incidence of facial paralysis in 111 consecutive cases with this intraoperative monitoring method compared with 14.5% in 207 previously unmonitored cases indicates significant reduction of this complication in cerebellopontine angle surgery (p less than 0.001). Along with this reduction in facial paralysis, an increase in the percentage of partial facial paresis was observed in the monitored group (p less than 0.05). The percentage of those with intact facial function was similar in the monitored (82.0%) and unmonitored groups (78.3%). 
Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect. Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect differs significantly from the management of the perimembranous (infracristal) ventricular septal defect. The absence of a portion of the conal septum can lead to prolapse of the right cusp of the aortic valve, which predisposes these patients to aortic insufficiency. Between January 1980 and December 1989, 36 children with conal ventricular septal defect underwent intracardiac repair. Diagnosis was by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and intraoperative exploration. Preoperative evaluation showed that 26 patients (72%) had aortic valve prolapse and 16 (44%) had aortic insufficiency. Pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios ranged from 1:1 to 3.5:1 (mean 2.0:1.0). Ten patients (27%) were believed to have clinical congestive heart failure. Age at the time of operation ranged from 2 weeks to 18 years (mean 5.5 years). Operative exposure was through the pulmonary artery (26), aorta (4), right ventricle (3), or right atrium (3). Simultaneous aortic valve suspension for aortic insufficiency was performed in four patients. Operative survival was 100%. Follow-up is complete in all patients and ranges from 0.5 to 9 years (mean 4.3 years). All patients are in normal sinus rhythm. No residual ventricular septal defects have been identified. Twenty-three of 36 patients (64%) have no evidence of aortic insufficiency; 12 of 36 (33%) have trivial or mild aortic insufficiency. One patient with initial severe aortic insufficiency underwent repeat aortic valvuloplasty 3 years after ventricular septal defect closure and aortic valve suspension. No patients have required aortic valve replacement. Surgical management of the conal ventricular septal defect differs from that of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect in two critical aspects. The operative approach should be through the pulmonary artery. This allows the best exposure of the remaining conal septum and the pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets, facilitating closure of the defect without injury to the valves or conduction system. Conal ventricular septal defects should undergo early closure, regardless of shunt volume, to prevent progressive aortic insufficiency. 
Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized older patients who develop hypocholesterolemia. OBJECTIVES: This research project was undertaken to determine the clinical characteristics, lipoprotein abnormalities, and outcomes of older hospitalized patients who develop hypocholesterolemia. METHODS: The project had two parts: (1) a retrospective, case-control study of 50 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose serum cholesterol was normal on admission (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL) and fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization; (2) a laboratory study of lipoproteins in 17 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose cholesterol was normal on admission but fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization. RESULTS: Case-control Study--Nine percent of patients greater than or equal to 65 years old developed hypocholesterolemia while in the hospital, and these patients were more likely than controls to have undergone surgery and to have nothing by mouth for 5 days or longer. Cases had a longer length of stay, more complications, and were slightly more likely to die in the hospital than controls. LABORATORY STUDY--Hypocholesterolemic patients had low concentrations of all lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL), and the LDL and HDL were enriched in triglyceride and depleted of cholesterol ester. CONCLUSION: Acquired hypocholesterolemia is a common finding in hospitalized older patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Patients who became hypocholesterolemic in the hospital had both a low concentration of lipoprotein particles and abnormalities in lipoprotein particle composition. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Rate and incidence of capsular contracture: a comparison of smooth and textured silicone double-lumen breast prostheses. Capsular contracture results in dissatisfaction and deformity among the 2 million women who have had silicone implants. The literature describes contracture rates as high as 74 percent. I present a comparison of rates and incidences of contracture in patients augmented with smooth and textured double-lumen silicone implants. A total of 165 "smooth" and 63 "textured" implant patients were included in this study, which spans 12 years, 1978-1990. All patients underwent bilateral aesthetic augmentation performed by the same surgeon. Of the 165 smooth implant patients, 74 (44.8 percent) experienced contractures requiring treatment. Of the 63 textured implant patients, 3 (4.8 percent) previous contracture patients experienced sudden fibrosis within 3 months. All others remained soft. It appears that deeply textured silicone surfaces delay or decrease the rate and incidence of clinical capsular contracture, at least for 2 years. 
Effects of enoximone on exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. To evaluate the efficacy of enoximone on exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, 33 patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise tests before and 3 hours after placebo or after receiving 25 or 100 mg of enoximone administered randomly in a double-blind manner. The electrocardiogram was monitored and blood pressure measured every minute throughout cycle ergometer exercise testing with a ramp protocol in which the work rate increased 1 W every 6 seconds after a 4-minute 20-W warm-up. Minute ventilation, oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide output were measured every 10 seconds in order to determine anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak VO2. Five patients were excluded from evaluation before breaking the double-blind key because of insufficient data. Heart rate increased and systolic blood pressure decreased throughout the testing only in the group taking 100 mg (n = 10). Significant increases in AT (14.4 to 16.2 ml/min/kg) and peak VO2 (20.8 to 22.9 ml/min/kg) were observed in the group taking 100 mg. The increases in AT showed a dose response, namely +0.7% in the placebo (n = 9), +6.9% in the 25-mg (n = 9) and 12.5% in the 100-mg group. The work rates at the AT point increased in the 25- and 100-mg groups. These results indicate that a single oral administration of enoximone improves exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. 
Leg paresthesias induced by magnetic brain stimulation in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury. We studied the induction of leg paresthesias by magnetic stimulation of the brain in seven patients with thoracic T9-12 spinal cord injury and in four normal volunteers by delivering transcranial magnetic stimulation over scalp positions 1 cm apart with a Cadwell MES-10 magnetic stimulator and an 8-shaped magnetic coil at 100% stimulus intensity. We asked subjects to report sensations felt after each stimulus. In all normal subjects, magnetic stimulation evoked sensations described as tingling or a wave descending along the leg, usually accompanied by EMG responses in leg muscles. In three of the seven patients, stimulation evoked sensations of tingling, numbness, touch, or a wave descending along the leg, lasting up to 10 seconds and referred to different parts of the legs and toes. In the patients, sensations were felt more distally the closer the site of stimulation was to the midline. Patients with leg paresthesias had less motor reorganization in abdominal muscles than those without paresthesias. These findings suggest that portions of the cortical representation areas for body parts deafferented by a complete spinal cord injury can remain related to those body parts for up to several years. A central origin of these paresthesias is probable. 
Monoclonal anti-T cell (T12) antibody treatment of graft-versus-host disease in severe combined immunodeficiency: targeting of antibody and activation of complement on CD8+ cytotoxic T cell surfaces. We report a 6-month-old male child with severe combined immunodeficiency who received an unirradiated blood transfusion and developed acute, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), for which he received monoclonal anti-T cell (anti-T12) antibody treatment. The GVHD was manifested by a confluent maculopapular rash and increased liver function tests and was documented by skin biopsy. Separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells forming rosettes with sheep red blood cells revealed engrafted T cells having the nonrelated HLA type of the blood donor. The patient was treated with intravenous monoclonal anti-T12 in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day for 5 days. An in vivo effect of the anti-T12 was suggested by clinical improvement of his skin rash and return of the liver transaminases to the normal range. Moreover, human complement components, activated C3 and C4, were detected by fluorescence microscopy on the surfaces of the engrafted CD8+ lymphocytes on the skin biopsy specimens. Also, with a biotin-avadin assay, the presence of the anti-T12 was detected on these same cells. These studies document not only the in vivo targeting of monoclonal anti-T12 antibody to cytotoxic T cells producing GVHD but also the activation of complement on these cells. 
Pachymeningitis associated with a pulmonary nodule. The authors report a case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, a rare cause of spinal cord compression. In this patient, dural inflammation was associated with a histologically identical pulmonary lesion. Such an association has not been described previously and supports the hypothesis that this disease is related to other connective tissue disorders. 
Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine. This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine. Reactions consisted mainly of seizures, acute psychoses, anxiety neurosis, and major disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm. Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions. The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended. 
Recurrent severe traumatic brain injury. Series of six cases. Six of 141 persons treated for severe traumatic brain injury at the Medical College of Virginia were found to have a history of similar previous injury. These cases are presented in the context of the phenomenon of recurrent severe traumatic brain injury, which has received no systematic attention in epidemiologic studies of trauma. 
Paravermal infarct and isolated cerebellar dysarthria. A patient with isolated cerebellar dysarthria is reported. Computed tomography showed a small infarct in the left paravermal zone of the rostal cerebellum (lobulus simplex and semilunaris superior) in the territory of the medial branch of the superior cerebellar artery. This patient demonstrates the important role of this area of cerebellum in the control of voice. 
Muscle mitochondrial DNA in encephalomyopathy and ragged red fibres: a Southern blot analysis and literature review. Various mitochondrial DNA abnormalities have been described in patients with encephalomyopathies. We performed Southern blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA in nine adult patients with clinical features and ragged red fibres suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Two patients with encephalomyopathy and two with the MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres) had the normal PvuII restriction pattern of muscle mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data. 
Results of surgery for duodenal ulcer: assessment by patients. A questionnaire was administered to 224 patients who had undergone 246 operations for duodenal ulcer to see how well this correlated with Visick grading and to provide insight into the patients' feelings about the results of their surgery. The patients were divided into three groups by Visick grade: good (grade I, n = 70), satisfactory (grades II and IIIs, n = 104) and poor (grades IIIu and IV, n = 72). The distribution of questionnaire responses in each group was statistically different (P less than 0.01). Dividing the questionnaire responses into three corresponding groups, 72 per cent of patients assigned themselves to the same group as their Visick grade. Three observations were made regarding the Visick system: recurrent ulceration is over-scored and should be included only if symptomatic; grading should acknowledge a wider range of symptoms related to ulcer disease and its treatment; only three grades are necessary. 
Decreased plasticity of glucoregulatory responses in aged rats: effects of chronic stress. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of age and chronic stress on the ability of rats to attenuate stimulus-induced glucose and insulin responses during repeated exposure to a mild stressor. Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment. 
Lyme neuroborreliosis: a new sensitive diagnostic assay for intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia burgdorferi--specific immunoglobulin G, A, and M. An antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure directly intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, A, and M synthesis specific for Borrelia burgdorferi. Purified, biotin-avidin-peroxidase-labeled B. burgdorferi flagella was used as test antigen. Paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens from 100 patients with clinically definite neuroborreliosis and 35 control subjects with neurological diseases were examined. Significant B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal IgG, A, and M production was found in 89%, 65% and 67% of patients with neuroborreliosis. Local synthesis of specific IgA was only seen in patients with significant local IgG synthesis. Antibody production in cerebrospinal fluid began by 2 weeks after onset of neurological symptoms. At the end of the second week specific IgM, IgG, or both, was detected in 88% of the patients. Specific IgG synthesis was present in all patients by 6 weeks after onset. Specific local IgM synthesis usually disappeared by 3 to 6 months after therapy, whereas specific IgG synthesis persisted after recovery. Even in patients with a severely altered blood-brain barrier, the assay discriminated between intrathecal antibody synthesis and antibody leakage from serum. The assay makes diagnostic measurement of B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis reliable, rapid, and accessible as a routine serological test. 
Dynamic acquisition with a three-headed SPECT system: application to technetium 99m-SQ30217 myocardial imaging. A method for SPECT data acquisition, "continuous repetitive rotation acquisition," was developed with a high-sensitivity three-headed SPECT system. The method was applied to the dynamic imaging of 99mTc-SQ30217, a new myocardial imaging agent. After acquisition and reconstruction of SPECT data every minute, projection images at arbitrary intervals were used for tomographic reconstruction to determine the best timing of SPECT imaging in 99mTc-SQ30217. Based on a comparison of several possible acquisition intervals, SPECT data acquisition within 9 min after injection is recommended because of high myocardial uptake (myocardium-to-lung ratio, 2.83 +/- 0.42 (mean +/- s.e.m.) at 3-6 min) and relatively low hepatic uptake (myocardium-to-liver ratio, 0.85 +/- 0.13 at 3-6 min). The rate constant of the clearance of 99mTc-SQ30217 from the myocardium obtained by SPECT was: k1 = 0.249 +/- 0.050 per min (average half-life = 2.8 min) and k2 = 0.012 +/- 0.004/min (average half-life = 58 min). The continuous repetitive rotation acquisition SPECT study appears useful for imaging SQ30217 with its rapidly changing myocardial distribution. 
Acute illness in maple syrup urine disease: dynamics of protein metabolism and implications for management. Acute metabolic decompensation in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) during otherwise minor illnesses has generally been presumed to result from massive release of leucine from protein catabolism. A stable isotope method based on the continuous infusion of (2H5)phenylalanine was used to measure protein metabolism in vivo in two children with MSUD during acute illness and when well. Net protein catabolism was greater in the unwell state (0.51 and 0.40 gm/kg per 24 hours in each child, respectively) than in the basal state (0.34 and 0.32). This rate of release of leucine from protein is compatible only with a slow (several days) rather than a dramatic rise in plasma leucine levels during acute illness in MSUD. Poor oral intake leading to a relative increase in time spent in the fasting state appears to be a more important determinant of increasing leucine levels than the catabolic effect of infection in itself. These factors suggested that branched-chain amino acid restriction should be commenced at the start of minor illness in children with MSUD, and that intake of other nutrients should be maintained or increased throughout the illness. A regimen based on these concepts was used during nine episodes of minor illness in two children with MSUD. Plasma branched-chain amino acid levels remained acceptable (less than 700 mumol/L) throughout each of these episodes. Dietary supplementation of this type may reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation during acute illnesses in children with MSUD. 
Unrecognized stenosis by angiography documented by intravascular ultrasound imaging. This report documents how intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to diagnose a short "napkin-ring" stenosis that was missed by coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound revealed a lumen of 2.6 x 2.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm2 in cross-sectional area, with a residual atheroma that occluded 63% of available cross-sectional area at the stenosis. 
Failure of dithiothreitol and pronase to reveal a false-positive cryptococcal antigen determination in cerebrospinal fluid. A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a serum rheumatoid factor (RF) of 1:1,280 had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) latex agglutination test (LAT) for cryptococcal antigen, in culture-negative, India-ink-negative CSF. Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result. The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described. Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF. Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt. Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF. 
Poliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors. A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children. They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus. The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed. 
Do otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons and/or chemotherapy have a role in the treatment of head and neck cancer? We provide an update on the current status of chemotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The role of the otolaryngology--head and neck surgeon in this important clinical research is underscored. Those involved with treating patients with head and neck cancer must understand the mechanisms of clinical cancer research. Physicians in academic and community settings can be intimately involved in this treatment. 
Management of temporal bone carcinomas: a therapeutic analysis of two groups of patients and long-term followup. Fifty-one patients with squamous cell carcinomas arising within the temporal bone were subdivided into two groups. The initial group of 17 patients, seen between 1960 and 1980, were reviewed retrospectively and staged into four subgroups on the basis of initial tumor presentation and location (i.e., external auditory canal, superficial invasion, deep invasion, and tumors beyond the temporal bone). After treatment in a variety of surgical and radiotherapeutic combinations, the 5-year cure rates were: 70%, 70%, 50%, and 9%, respectively. Thirty-four patients, seen between 1980 and 1989, were placed in a new prospective protocol for combined surgery and postoperative irradiation. These patients were subdivided into the same subgroups on the basis of tumor location. The surgical procedures were formalized to be more encompassing (i.e., external canal tumors were treated by sleeve resection of the internal auditory canal and tympanic membrane, superficial invasion by superficial temporal bone resection, deep tumors by radical temporal bone resection, and those beyond the temporal bone by an infratemporal fossa approach). Radical neck dissections were performed where needed. The irradiation dosage was increased to 6250+ cGy, with a 4:1 ratio in favor of electrons for deeper penetration, and the fields were widened. At 36.6-month average followup, the cure rates were: 100%, 100%, 70%, and 65%, respectively. Six of ten patients with neck metastases at presentation had tumor recurrence or distant disease (60%). 
Modulation of splanchnic vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II. We studied whether the diminished splanchnic vascular response to angiotensin II infusion in portal hypertension could be related to elevated levels of prostacyclin (PGI2). The changes in superior mesenteric artery resistance (RSMA) and systemic vascular resistance (RSYS) during angiotensin II infusion were measured by Doppler flow probe in normal rabbits (NL) and portal hypertensive rabbits (PHT), and in NL and PHT after cyclooxygenase blockade (CO) and after CO and during continuous PGI2 infusion at 300 ng/kg/min. Angiotensin II infusion in NL caused a disproportionately greater increase in RSMA than in RSYS (p less than 0.01). In PHT, angiotensin II response of RSMA was reduced from NL (p less than 0.05). CO dramatically improved the splanchnic response to angiotensin II in PHT animals, but did not significantly alter the RSMA response in NL. PGI2 in NL, NL + CO, and PHT + CO quantitatively established the splanchnic vascular hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin II seen in PHT. We conclude that PGI2 will directly diminish splanchnic response to angiotensin II in NL, and CO will ablate differences in splanchnic response between NL and PHT to angiotensin II. This strongly implies that much of the observed decrease in angiotensin II response in PHT is mediated by PGI2 and that the differences between NL and PHT vascular response is in part the result of circulating vasodilatory substances. 
Digitally-directed transrectal biopsy using Biopty gun versus transrectal needle aspiration: comparison of diagnostic yield and comfort. A technique for digitally-directed core biopsy using the Biopty device and prospective comparison of accuracy and comfort, using this technique simultaneously with transrectal needle aspiration, are presented. To better estimate the true prevalence of carcinoma in the study population, a repeat combined procedure was performed on all subjects who did not have carcinoma confirmed on the initial core biopsies. All procedures were done by one investigator and all pathology reviewed by one senior pathologist. A total of 180 combined procedures were performed on 100 consecutive patients with palpably abnormal prostates; 30 carcinomas were detected. Digitally-directed Biopty biopsy yielded a sensitivity rate of 87 percent compared with 57 percent for needle aspiration (p less than 0.05). Using a numerical comfort scale, the Biopty device was also rated less painful than needle aspiration (p = 0.0001). The morbidity of the combined procedure was minimal, with a minor complication rate of 2.2 percent. No infections occurred. 
Left ventricular myocardial edema. Lymph flow, interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac function. We hypothesized that both acute and chronic accumulation of myocardial interstitial edema (extravascular fluid [EVF]) would compromise cardiac function. We also postulated that excess fluid within the myocardial interstitial space would potentiate interstitial fibrosis, thus further compromising function. Dogs were divided into three groups: 1) control, 2) chronic pulmonary hypertensive with right heart failure, and 3) chronic arterial hypertensive. The quantity of EVF, expressed as the unitless blood-free (wet weight-dry weight)/dry weight ratio, and interstitial fibrosis (collagen content) were determined and correlated with cardiac function at baseline and after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Control EVF was 2.90 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD), which increased to 3.45 +/- 0.16 after acute (3-hour) elevation of coronary sinus pressure. This EVF significantly compromised cardiac function. The EVF in chronically hypertensive dogs and in dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevations was 3.50 +/- 0.30 and 3.50 +/- 0.08, respectively. End-diastolic left ventricular interstitial fluid pressure increased from a control value of 14.9 +/- 3.1 (at EVF = 2.9) to 24.8 +/- 3.7 (at EVF = 3.5). An EVF of 3.5 produced approximately 30% reduction of the heart's ability to maintain cardiac output at a left atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg. The compromised function in these chronic models is exacerbated after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Collagen levels were elevated by at least 20% in the chronic hypertensive dogs and in the nonhypertrophied left ventricles of dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevation. 
Computed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or "black dots." The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. 
Cardiac resuscitation by extracorporeal circulation after failure of conventional CPR. After cardiac arrest, return of cardiac function and effective circulation are contingent on prompt restoration of myocardial blood flow. Because conventional closed-chest CPR has limited hemodynamic efficiency, we investigated venoarterial ECC utilizing peripheral vascular access as an alternative for cardiac resuscitation. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in domestic pigs by alternating current delivered to the endocardium of the right ventricle. Conventional closed-chest CPR was begun after 10 minutes. In each instance, precordial compression and external defibrillation failed to restore a viable rhythm. ECC was begun at 15 minutes at an average flow rate of 183 ml/kg/min. In each of eight animals, sinus rhythm was restored. In six of these eight animals, spontaneous circulation was reestablished after an average interval of 152 minutes. When epinephrine was administered concomitantly with ECC in an additional eight animals so as to maintain mean aortic pressure between 60 and 100 mm Hg, sinus rhythm and spontaneous circulation were reestablished in each pig after an average of only 23 minutes. The effects of ECC in conjunction with epinephrine were then compared with those of conventional precordial compression in conjunction with epinephrine (sham ECC). In contrast to ECC, which successfully resuscitated each of five animals, none of five sham ECC-treated animals was resuscitated by continued precordial compression and maximal doses of epinephrine (p less than 0.01). We conclude that ECC in conjunction with epinephrine emerges as a highly effective experimental intervention for resuscitation when conventional techniques of precordial compression and external defibrillation fail to reverse cardiac arrest. 
Hypertrophy of clitoral hood: presenting sign of neurofibromatosis in female child. Although clitoral involvement with neurofibromatosis is rare, all cases previously reported have described clitoral hypertrophy due to neurofibromas of the clitoral corpora. We report on a patient who had localized enlargement of the prepuce only, with no evidence of neurofibromatous infiltration. In all cases, diagnosis of clitoromegaly requires basic chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation. However, recognition of its association with neurofibromatosis due to either neurofibromas of the genitalia or localized genital hypertrophy may spare the patient an unnecessary or invasive evaluation. Because of an association with urinary tract neurofibromas, the patient with genital involvement should have cystoscopy. Clitoroplasty with sparing of the neurovascular bundle and glans is the preferred method of management of the enlarged clitoris. 
Development of a stable Leishmania expression vector and application to the study of parasite surface antigen genes. Trypanosomatid protozoan parasites cause several important tropical diseases and have been a fertile ground for the discovery of molecular paradigms such as trans-splicing and RNA editing. Transfection-based methods for the study of these organisms have recently been developed, and we have now designed an expression vector, pX, which contains only 2.3 kilobases of Leishmania DNA and can be stably transfected with high efficiency. Genes encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase or a Leishmania amazonensis protective membrane glycoprotein (GP46A/M-2) were inserted into the pX expression site and transfected into Leishmania major, where they directed the synthesis of high levels of mRNAs formed by 5' and 3' processing events occurring predominantly at the sites used by the normal transcripts. Colony assays and immunoblot analysis showed that both proteins were produced; enzymatically active beta-galactosidase comprised approximately 1% of total protein. Sizes of the GP46A protein synthesized in transfected L. major or L. amazonensis were similar and differed from the predominant L. amazonensis GP46, suggesting that the GP46A gene may encode a variant GP46 family member. Because these vectors function efficiently in pathogenic species of Leishmania, pX will facilitate the genetic analyses of parasite proteins crucial for infectivity as well as the identification of cis-acting elements mediating transcription and replication. 
The effects of cyclobenzaprine on sleep physiology and symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia. A double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design study examined overnight sleep physiology, pain, fatigue, and mood symptoms in 12 patients with fibromyalgia treated with cyclobenzaprine. Nine patients completed the study. Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine showed a decrease in evening fatigue (F = 4.7, p less than 0.05) and an increase in total sleep time (F = 4.4, p less than 0.05). Pain, including tender point count and dolorimetry, mood ratings, and alpha non-REM EEG sleep anomaly were unchanged by cyclobenzaprine. 
Primary prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in hypertensive patients. Mortality results from the MAPHY Study. In a randomized primary prevention trial including 3,234 men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, the effect of the beta-blocker metoprolol or a thiazide diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was compared regarding the risk of sudden cardiovascular death during a follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 years (median of 4.2 years). Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension. 
Frequency of low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hospitalized patients with "desirable" total cholesterol levels. Because the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines suggest that levels of total serum cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) are "desirable," we performed a retrospective observational analysis to determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) and the prevalence of total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) in patients with CAD by angiography. Cholesterol levels less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) were found in 1,084 of 2,535 patients (42%) having cholesterol measured on hospital admission; 690 of these 1,084 (64%) had CAD. These patients were mostly men, had a family history of premature CAD, and 60% (414 of 690) had high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). In a separate group of patients defined from the same admission population but having angiographically established CAD, 32% (424 of 1,197) had a total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl), 59% of whom (252 of 424) had HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). An analysis of persons admitted electively for angiography (to exclude any effects of hospitalization per se on serum lipids) revealed a similar proportion of persons with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) (35%), CAD (82%), and HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl). 
Is large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) more accurate than colposcopically directed punch biopsy in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? In 100 women with suspected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) attending the colposcopy clinic the histological diagnoses made from excision biopsies taken by large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) were compared with those from colposcopically directed punch biopsies taken concurrently. One unsuspected microinvasive tumour was found and the diagnosis made by LLETZ was significantly worse than that made by punch biopsy in 24 cases (24%: 95% CI 15.6 to 32.4%). LLETZ improves the accuracy of diagnosis of CIN. 
Classifying calcaneal tendon injury according to MRI findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 28 patients with suspected calcaneal tendon injury prior to treatment. None of the patients were involved in competitive sports. All underwent clinical examination, some had had ultrasound or CT scans. We identified four types of lesions: type I, inflammatory reaction; type II, degenerative change; type III, incomplete rupture and type IV, complete rupture. Thirteen of the 28 patients underwent surgery and the diagnostic findings were verified. We recommend that type I, type II and type III lesions be managed conservatively, while type IV lesions should be operated in the young and active patient. 
Improved specificity of myocardial thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block by dipyridamole. Reduced septal uptake of thallium-201 during exercise is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteries. This may reflect normal coronary autoregulation in response to lower septal oxygen demand; thus, dipyridamole, which uniformly exploits flow reserve, would be more accurate for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixteen patients with LBBB underwent exercise and dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within 3 months. Sensitivity for detection of left anterior descending CAD (greater than 50% stenosis) was 0.83 for exercise and 1.00 for dipyridamole. Specificity was 0.30 (visual) or 0.20 (quantitative analysis) for exercise and 0.80 (visual) or 0.90 (quantitative) for dipyridamole (p less than 0.05). Dipyridamole combined with quantitative analysis also improved specificity of CAD detection overall (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that pharmacologic vasodilation is more accurate than exercise when diagnosing CAD by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with LBBB. 
Contribution of monocytes to the decreased lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin in patients with lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer (LC) have a reduced T-cell proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with that of healthy individuals. This decreased response is a result of an inhibitory effect exerted by the monocytes as evidenced by: (1) a restoration to normal levels of the response to PHA when the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of adherent cells (AD) and (2) a dose-dependent inhibition of the response to PHA when the nonadherent cell population was co-cultured with increasing numbers of autologous AD cells. The addition of indomethacin to the cultures resulted in only a partial restoration of the response to PHA. Monocyte production of interleukin-1 from patients with LC in response to lipopolysaccharide was normal. These findings support the hypothesis that the AD cell population plays a major role in the low T-cell proliferative response to PHA in patients with LC. This suppressor effect is partially mediated by the prostaglandins released by the monocytes. 
Coronary venous retroinfusion of deferoxamine reduces infarct size in pigs. The efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion of the iron chelator deferoxamine was studied in 24 pentobarbital-anesthetized open chest pigs with a 60 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Eight retrogradely treated pigs were given 10 mg/kg body weight of deferoxamine by way of the anterior interventricular vein and eight systemically treated pigs received the same doses of deferoxamine intravenously. Drug infusions lasted for 5 min, beginning 15 min before reperfusion. Eight control pigs received systemic intravenous saline solution. Myocardial area at risk and necrotic area were assessed by the monastral blue dye and the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method, respectively. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics or regional myocardial function (sonomicrometry) among the groups. Infarct size expressed as percent of risk area was 73.9 +/- 13.5% in the control group, 70.6 +/- 16.4% in the systemically treated group and 48.5 +/- 21.4% (p less than 0.05) in the retrogradely treated group. In conclusion, deferoxamine significantly reduced infarct size after coronary occlusion only when given regionally by way of the coronary vein. Because there was no significant hemodynamic effect caused by deferoxamine infusion, it is suggested that this drug prevents postischemic reperfusion injury by a direct cardioprotective effect. 
Diseases that mimic multiple sclerosis. Because no one laboratory test is diagnostic of multiple sclerosis, evaluation involves careful exclusion of other possible diagnoses. Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable tool in this process. Clues from a scan can confirm findings from the history and physical and laboratory examinations. Dr Scott compares typical findings of multiple sclerosis with those of the four diseases that are sometimes mistaken for this syndrome. 
A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously. 
Simultaneous ipsilateral vasal and epididymal reconstruction. Injuries to the spermatic cords, sustained during childhood inguinal hernioplasty, caused unilateral testicular atrophy, multiple bilateral excurrent duct obstruction and aspermia. Simultaneous unilateral vasal reconstruction and vaso-epididymostomy resulted in satisfactory semen parameters. It is expected that vasal integrity will be maintained after multiple reconstructive procedures at different locations if further injury to the vascular supply of the excurrent duct is avoided. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Romania. After the initial description of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Romania in late 1989, national AIDS case surveillance was established with a modified version of the World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical case definition. This modified case definition requires that AIDS cases have both clinical and serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Before December, 1989, Romania had reported 13 AIDS cases to WHO. By Dec 31, 1990, 1168 AIDS cases were reported to Romania's Ministry of Health, of which 1094 (93.7%) occurred in children less than 13 years of age at diagnosis. Of these, 1086 (99.3%) were in infants and children less than 4 years of age, and 683 (62.4%) in abandoned children living in public institutions at the time of diagnosis. By Dec 31, 1990, 493 (45.1%) mothers of children with AIDS had been located and tested, and 37 (7.5%) were positive for HIV; 423 (38.7%) cases were in children who had received transfusions of unscreened blood, and 6 (0.5%) were in children with clotting disorders. HIV transmission through the improper use of needles and syringes is strongly suspected in most of the remaining 628 (57.4%) children with AIDS, most of whom had received multiple therapeutic injections. This outbreak demonstrates the serious potential for HIV transmission in medical facilities that intensively and improperly use parenteral therapy and have poor sterilisation technique. 
Physical training and antiplatelet treatment in stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease: alone or combined? The efficacy of physical training alone or combined with antiplatelet therapy (dipyridamole and aspirin) was studied in 30 patients with stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: Group A--dipyridamole 75 mg three times daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily: Group B--physical exercise; Group C--physical exercise and dipyridamole 75 mg three time daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily. After six months' treatment the pain-free walking time (PFWT) and the maximum walking time (MWT) improved significantly (p less than 0.05) in all three groups. In group A the PFWT lengthened by 35% (from 101.00 +/- 34.56 to 137.32 +/- 40.50 s) and the MWT by 38% (from 150.34 +/- 55.60 to 207.26 +/- 60.67 s); in group B the PFWT lengthened by 90% (from 90.65 +/- 40.54 to 171.45 +/- 55.60 s) and the MWT by 86% (from 145.39 +/- 60.50 to 270.63 +/- 63.61 s). When physical exercise was associated with drugs as in group C, the PFWT lengthened by 120% (from 89.51 +/- 43.89 to 196.72 +/- 51.73 s) and the MWT by 105% (from 160.43 +/- 59.84 to 329.05 +/- 63.96 s). No significant variations were observed at any stage of the study in the ankle/arm pressure ratio at rest and after standard treadmill exercise, in the plethysmographic rest and peak flows, or in the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in basal conditions and in its half recovery time after an induced ischemia. The results confirm the benefits of regular exercise in stage II PAOD patients but suggest they may be enhanced by antiplatelet therapy. 
Reverse-perfused sleeve: an improved device for measurement of sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm. The sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm has been difficult to measure in humans. The authors recently reported the use of a Dent sleeve device to measure esophagogastric junction pressure during contraction of the crural diaphragm. However, the major limitation of the conventional sleeve device is its slow response rate, and sustained diaphragmatic contractions of 6-8 seconds must be induced to measure the true pressure. In this article, the principles of a reverse-perfused sleeve device and the theoretical basis for its fast response rate are reported. The reverse-perfused sleeve is validated in an in vitro model of the lower esophageal sphincter. Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed in seven healthy human subjects. Standardized Muller maneuvers and straight-leg raises were performed to induce diaphragmatic contractions. Pressure increases of 50-150 mm Hg during diaphragmatic contractions were attained in less than 1 second. The delay between the actual contraction of the diaphragm as measured by simultaneously recorded crural diaphragm electromyography and pressure recorded by the sleeve was only 0.25-0.50 seconds. Increasing the rate of infusion of the sleeve from 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min did not further improve the response rate of the reverse perfused sleeve. It was concluded that the reverse-perfused sleeve is a considerable improvement over the conventional sleeve for quantitating the sphincteric function of the crural diaphragm. The role of the crural diaphragm in reflux esophagitis may be easily investigated using a reverse-perfused sleeve device. 
Long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction. To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction. 
Comparison of estrogen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor content of primary and involved nodes in human breast cancer. Estrogen receptors (ER) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in the tumor cells of breast cancer tissues (primary tumors) and metastatic lymph nodes (involved nodes) were analyzed by immunocytochemical study in 19 patients; 12 were ER positive, and seven were ER negative. Microscopic study was used to determine the percentage of positive cells and the staining index. The percentage of EGFR-positive cells and the EGFR staining index were higher in the ER-negative primary tumors than ER-positive primary tumors. In ER-positive cases, both the number of ER-positive cells and ER content per cell was less in the involved nodes than in the primary tumors, whereas the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell was greater in affected nodes. On the other hand, in the ER-negative cases the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell remain almost unchanged between the primary tumors and involved nodes. The authors supposed a probability, in this study, that estrogen may exert inhibitory action on EGFR production through binding to ER. 
Assessment of myocardial perfusion by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) represents an advanced imaging technology for the noninvasive evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow. Several blood flow tracers are available, including cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals such as [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 and generator-produced rubidium-82 ([82Rb]-) and copper-62 ([62Cu]-) pyruvaldehyde-bis-(N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (PTSM). 82Rb and [13N]NH3 are the most commonly employed tracers for the qualitative evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion. Their use allows the accurate detection of coronary artery disease in combination with pharmacologic stress. Initial comparative studies with thallium-201 (201Tl) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have shown that PET has a higher diagnostic accuracy. Beyond improved diagnostic performance, the quantitative flow measurements provided by PET represent an important advance in nuclear cardiology. The radiopharmaceuticals [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 have been applied for the noninvasive determination of regional coronary reserve. Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling yields blood flow values in close agreement with determinations provided by invasive procedures. The noninvasive quantification of blood flow provides a useful research and clinical tool for the objective assessment of therapeutic interventions as well as pathophysiologic alterations of regional myocardial blood flow in various cardiac diseases. 
Eosinophilic fasciitis is clinically distinguishable from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and is not associated with L-tryptophan use. Induration of the skin develops in a majority of patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan, and bears striking clinical and histopathological resemblance to eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). These similarities have led to the suggestion that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF are the same disease. To study the relationship of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF, we ascertained the prevalence of L-tryptophan use in a cohort of patients with EF, and compared their clinical and laboratory findings to those of patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated cutaneous involvement. None of 11 patients who were diagnosed as having EF between 1970 and 1989 used L-tryptophan containing preparations prior to the onset of their illness. Marked clinical and laboratory test differences were observed between patients with EF and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a more acute onset, more severe symptoms, higher frequency of rash and of pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, myopathic and thyroid involvement compared to patients with EF. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in improvement of cutaneous involvement in 88% of patients with EF but it was only partially successful in patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Hospitalization and fatalities occurred only among patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. These observations demonstrate that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a more severe disease with multisystemic involvement that can be clinically distinguished from EF. In contrast to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, EF is not associated with L-tryptophan ingestion. 
Prediction of major cardiac events after peripheral vascular surgery using dipyridamole echocardiography. Patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk of postoperative cardiac complications. To evaluate the role of dipyridamole echocardiography in predicting major cardiac events, 109 unselected patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative dipyridamole echocardiograms were interpreted by an echocardiographer unaware of all clinical data. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge by research physicians without knowledge of dipyridamole echocardiography results. Outcomes were classified using strict predefined criteria by reviewers unaware of other clinical and echocardiographic data. Of the 109 patients, 9 (8%) had positive studies defined as development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexistent wall motion abnormalities. Of these 9 patients, 7 had postoperative events, including 3 cardiac deaths, 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 with unstable angina, and 1 with pulmonary edema. Only 1 event occurred among the 100 patients with negative studies. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting cardiac events after vascular surgery were 88 and 98%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 78 and 99%. The relative risk of having a cardiac event if dipyridamole echocardiography was abnormal was 78 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 564; p less than 0.0001). If these results are extended and confirmed by other investigators, preoperative dipyridamole echocardiography may be an important screening test for patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery. 
Efficacy of intraarterial heparin in maintaining microvascular patency: an experimental model. Human-grade sodium heparin was studied to determine thrombosis model patency rates between an intraarterial infusion versus an intravenous method of delivery in a rabbit model. Specific differences in patency and partial thromboplastin times were studied in each group and compared with a saline-perfused group. Three animal groups (New Zealand white rabbits) were established (total = 35 animals). Standardized femoral arterial 5-mm inversion grafts (AIG) were done in each animal in each group. The animals in the control group received intravenous saline infusion, while the two treatment groups received intravenous heparin (12 animals) or intraarterial heparin (12 animals minus 1 anesthesia death). The route of instillation of the infusate was selected at random after completing the inversion grafts. A proximal epigastric branch was utilized for access in those animals randomized to the intraarterial group. Intravenous delivery was accomplished by means of a femoral venous catheter in the vena cava. A 72-hour period of infusion was used in all animals. A dose of 45 units per hour of heparin following a 500-unit bolus was used in the intravenous group. After an identical bolus dose, 25 units per hour of heparin was administered in the intraarterial group. The control (saline group) was given 1 cc saline (in a volume equal to the heparin-dosed groups) daily for 3 days. Arterial inversion graft patency rates were assessed by direct inspection at day 5. Systemic and regional (i.e., distal to the inversion graft) partial thromboplastin times (PTT) were measured in representative control, IV, and intraarterial heparin-treated groups. Complications were recorded. 
Apheresis-elutriation program for adoptive immunotherapy with autologous activated monocytes in cancer patients. Human blood monocytes (Mo) and monocyte-derived macrophages (M phi) are known to be potent antitumor cytotoxic effector cells through activation with recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma), bacterial muramyldipeptide or the synthetic derivative muramyltripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine entrapped in liposomes (L-MTP-PE). Large-scale generation of ex vivo activated Mo from the blood of cancer patients proved feasible. We report our experience with a fixed rotor speed counterflow centrifugation elutration (CEE) procedure using the newly available Beckman high capacity JE-5.0 rotor system that reproducibly isolates up to 1.0-1.5 x 10(9) Mo with greater than 90% purity, in suspension and functionally intact derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-enriched suspensions obtained by leukapheresis (LP) from healthy volunteers and cancer patients. The semiclosed, easy to handle CCE system, was adapted to a sterile technique that permitted clinical trials in adoptive monocyte immunotherapy. Freshly isolated Mo did not lose morphological or functional integrity and had no spontaneous activation. Their abilities to become activated to the cytotoxic state after 18-h stimulation with 500 U/ml rIFN-gamma or 1 microgram/ml L-MTP-PE and to differentiate into matured M phi in vitro were not altered. The system was therefore used to isolate large numbers of Mo for a phase I clinical trial of intraperitoneal immunotherapy with L-MTP-PE activated autologous Mo in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Each patient received weekly Mo infusions (n = 5) with an intrapatient dose escalation schedule (from 10(7) to 10(9) Mo). Toxicities were mild including fever, chills and abdominal pain. There was no treatment-induced thromboembolic event or capillary leak syndrome. 
Latency and time-dependent exposure in a case-control study. Detailed historical data are elicited often from subjects in retrospective studies, yielding time-dependent measures of exposures. Investigation of a hypothesized period of latency can be made by examining disease/exposure relationships in multiple time windows, either along the age or time-before diagnosis axes. We suggest splitting the data into many time intervals and separately fitting regression models to the available data in each interval. Covariances between estimated coefficients from different intervals are empirically estimated, and used for assessing variability of specified functions of the time-specific coefficients. Alternative methods of interval formation and their consequences are discussed. We apply these methods to a French case-control study of oral contraceptive use and cervical cancer incidence, and compare the results to those of standard analyses. 
Dipyridamole 201Tl scintigraphy in the evaluation of prognosis after myocardial infarction. Dipyridamole 201Tl imaging has been proposed as an alternative to exercise ECG testing for the prehospital discharge evaluation of patients recovering from myocardial infarction. The rationale is that many postinfarction patients with exercise-induced ischemia experience later cardiac events, and the sensitivity of predischarge exercise ECG testing in patients with multivessel disease ranges from only 45% to 62%. In addition, several groups of investigators have shown the sensitivity of submaximum exercise 201Tl imaging to be less than ideal. This report summarizes the current status of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging in the period of 1-13 days after myocardial infarction. Although the number of studies performed to date is limited, the following conclusions can be drawn: dipyridamole 201Tl imaging after myocardial infarction was associated with no serious side effects, and those present could be quickly reversed with aminophylline; redistribution with dipyridamole 201Tl images definitely correlates with prognosis after uncomplicated myocardial infarction; dipyridamole 201Tl imaging is definitely useful in patients unable to exercise for a variety of reasons; and future studies are definitely indicated to further define the role of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging for assessing prognosis, especially in those patients undergoing interventional therapy after acute myocardial infarction. 
Bacterial translocation. The phenomenon of bacterial translocation, the movement of viable indigenous microorganisms across the intestinal epithelial barrier, has been recognized for almost 100 years. At the present time, the precise mechanism of microbial transport is unknown. Active epithelial uptake and phagocyte-mediated transport have been proposed as likely explanations for the extraintestinal movement of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes and distant organ sites. Translocation has been proposed as the pivotal process associated with intestinal origin portal sepsis in seriously ill and immunocompromised patients. While several etiologic factors can be implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial translocation, the present clinical implications are based almost solely on studies of dogs, rats and mice. Present investigations continue to suggest a causal relationship between intestinal mucosal integrity and infection by indigenous gastrointestinal bacteria. 
Superior vena caval thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Three patients with clinical suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, induced by either pacemaker or indwelling catheter, underwent transesophageal echocardiography. High short-axis cuts through the great vessels, however, revealed the presence of superior vena caval thrombus in all three patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive in establishing the diagnosis of superior vena caval thrombus than surface echocardiography. Comparison of transesophageal echocardiography with other diagnostic modalities is needed in assessing its overall sensitivity and specificity. 
The symptomatic os subfibulare. Avulsion fracture of the fibula associated with recurrent instability of the ankle. Four adults who had symptomatic instability of the ankle had an associated os subfibulare. Operative exploration revealed the ossicle to represent a non-union of an avulsion fracture of the anterior talofibular ligament. These findings suggest that an os subfibulare represents an avulsion fracture that may or may not be associated with laxity of the anterior talofibular ligament, rather than being a normal variant. 
A novel enzyme immunoassay for serodiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori has recently been implicated as an etiologic agent of gastroduodenal disorders. Comparing the antibody to H. pylori in the sera of patients with that of normal controls by Western blot analysis, a unique antibody was detected in the sera of patients, which reacted with the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. On the other hand, monoclonal antibody CP3 prepared in the authors' laboratory also recognized the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. Whether the serum antibody of the patient recognized the CP3 antigen purified by monoclonal antibody CP3 was then examined. Western blot analysis showed that the patient's serum reacted strongly with the affinity-purified CP3 antigen. Using monoclonal antibody CP3, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect CP3 antibody in sera was established. In patients with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, the titer of CP3 antibody was significantly higher than in normal controls and correlated with the histological grade of antral gastritis. The detection of CP3 antibody in sera is useful in the diagnosis of chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer associated with H. pylori infection and also in evaluation of the grade of gastritis. 
Acute short-term memory loss from trimethyltin exposure. We report a case of organic tin exposure in a graduate chemistry student. The inhalational and transcutaneous exposure occurred following a laboratory explosion. The patient initially presented with first and second degree burns of the face and chest, and developed an acute loss of short-term memory 72 hours after exposure. The memory loss gradually improved over the course of several months. 
Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. We describe two unusual cases of Epstein-Barr virus infection that were complicated by the virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, predominantly involving the spleen. Both patients were young adult men who presented with fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Both had prompt symptomatic and hematologic improvement following splenectomy. Severe constitutional symptoms recurred in one patient 1 month after splenectomy, and he died of septicemia 2 months later. In both cases, there was prominent hemophagocytosis in the splenic red pulp. Some hemophagocytosis was also noted in the liver from the fatal case. Unexpectedly, no hemophagocytosis was detected in the bone marrow biopsy specimens or marrow aspirates obtained from these patients. The DNA hybridization studies detected Epstein-Barr virus genomes in spleen samples from both patients, and both patients had atypical patterns of serologic response to the virus, suggesting that a defective immune response may lead to an unrestrained viral proliferation. We conclude that there is an association between chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and the hemophagocytic syndrome, but that the tissue distribution of the hemophagocytosis may be variable. 
Longer relapse-free period after sucralfate than after H2-blocker treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. In a prospective investigation of 2,045 patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease, the relapse-free period after acute treatment with sucralfate was evaluated over 1 year. This remission period was compared retrospectively with that achieved by previous treatment with a histamine-H2-blocker in the same patients. Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included. Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods. In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate. The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001). Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate. It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy. There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients. 
Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. 
Production of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Cultured human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines were analyzed for the presence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts for the cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 and for these proteins. This study demonstrates that both cytokines are synthesized and secreted by both normal keratinocytes and SCC lines. The rate of secretion of these cytokines can be augmented in response to a variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta and the combination of lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate. Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have been reported to influence the proliferation of cultured human fibroblasts. However, these cytokines had no significant effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes or the SCC lines tested. Although it seems unlikely that interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 could directly influence keratinocyte proliferation in vivo, the capacity of these cells to synthesize and release these cytokines supports earlier observations that keratinocytes may play an important role in augmenting an immune or inflammatory response. 
PBC 95k, a 95-kilodalton nuclear autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis. We have identified a novel antinuclear antibody (ANA) in the sera of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Sera from 22 of 50 PBC patients stained the nuclei of HEp-2 cells in a pattern of 5-20 discrete dots, on indirect immunofluorescence. Typically, the titers were higher than 1:1,280. This staining pattern was seen in only 4 of 1,240 ANA-positive samples from patients with other connective tissue diseases, and in none of the ANA-positive sera from 49 patients with other liver diseases. Sera which stained the nuclear dots bound a 95-kd polypeptide in immunoblots of HeLa nuclei and in immunoprecipitates of 35S-methionine-labeled HeLa extracts. Affinity-purified antibodies from the 95-kd protein reproduced the nuclear dot immunofluorescence staining pattern, demonstrating that this polypeptide is located in the nuclear dots. ANA of this type, therefore, occur in 44% of patients with PBC, and they appear to be specific for PBC. These antibodies bind a 95-kd protein that is discrete and is scattered throughout the nucleus. 
An evaluation of immunohistologic stains for immunoglobulin light chains in bone marrow biopsies in benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations. Bone marrow specimens from 226 patients with a variety of benign and malignant plasma cell proliferations were studied to assess the reliability of immunohistologic studies in their evaluation. The clonality of the bone marrow plasma cells was compared with results of serum and urine electrophoreses. Discordance was observed most frequently in cases in which a paraprotein was demonstrated, but no monoclonality was detected by immunoperoxidase (16 cases). Of these 16 cases, 9 had 5% or less bone marrow plasma cells. In only one case was the light chain class of the bone marrow plasma cells different from that of the paraprotein. If discordant cases with 5% or less plasma cells are eliminated, the overall concordance was 97%. The authors' findings indicate that immunohistologic studies for immunoglobulin light chains in Zenker-fixed decalcified bone marrow biopsy sections are reliable in the evaluation of patients with plasma cell proliferations when the marrow contains more than 5% plasma cells. 
The p53 tumour suppressor gene. The cell cycle is composed of a series of steps which can be negatively or positively regulated by various factors. Chief among the negative regulators is the p53 protein. Alteration or inactivation of p53 by mutation, or by its interactions with oncogene products of DNA tumour viruses, can lead to cancer. These mutations seem to be the most common genetic change in human cancers. 
Cerebral perfusion during canine hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass: effect of arterial carbon dioxide tension Cerebral blood flow (radioactive microspheres), intracranial pressure (subdural bolt), and retinal histopathology were examined in 20 dogs undergoing 150 minutes of hypothermic (28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass to compare alpha-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 40 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) and pH-stat (arterial carbon dioxide tension, 61 +/- 1 mm Hg; n = 10) techniques of arterial carbon dioxide tension management. Pump flow (80 mL.kg-1.min-1), mean aortic pressure (78 +/- 2 mm Hg), and hemoglobin level (87 +/- 3 g/L [8.7 +/- 0.3 g/dL]) were maintained constant. During bypass, intracranial pressure progressively increased in the alpha-stat group from 6.0 +/- 1.0 to 13.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and in the pH-stat group from 7.7 +/- 1.1 to 14.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), although there was no evidence of loss of intracranial compliance or intracranial edema formation as assessed by brain water content. With cooling, cerebral blood flow decreased by 56% to 62% in the alpha-stat group (p less than 0.05) and by 48% to 56% in the pH-stat group (p less than 0.05). However, 30 minutes after rewarming to 37 degrees C, cerebral blood flow in both groups failed to increase and remained significantly depressed compared with baseline values. Both groups showed similar amounts of ischemic retinal damage, with degeneration of bipolar cells found in the inner nuclear layer in 67% of animals. We conclude that, independent of the arterial carbon dioxide tension management technique, (1) cerebral perfusion decreased comparably during prolonged hypothermic bypass, (2) intracranial pressure increases progressively, (3) ischemic damage to retinal cells occurs despite maintenance of aortic pressure and flow, and (4) a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion persists after rewarming. 
Blindness resulting from orbital complications of sinusitis. Loss of vision remains a potential complication of orbital infection. Appropriate evaluation and management of the patient with signs and symptoms of orbital inflammation may prevent progression to blindness. Evaluation of patients with orbital inflammation from sinusitis includes a comprehensive clinical examination and radiographic studies. Clinical examination should test for changes in visual acuity, pupillary reactivity, and extraocular motion. Computerized tomography (CT) has facilitated the diagnosis of orbital infections and aids in diagnosis. However, CT can be misleading in patients with acute orbital infections and should not be relied on to determine the need for surgical intervention. We reviewed the records of all patients admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1978 to 1988 with orbital complications resulting from sinusitis. Four of 159 patients in this group had permanent blindness. The presence of an abscess, which was ultimately found at surgical exploration, was not diagnosed by CT in any of these four patients. Clinical examination remains the most important indicator for surgical intervention in patients with orbital complications of sinusitis. We present our findings and give guidelines for surgical intervention in patients with orbital infections resulting from sinusitis. 
Prediction of subclinical tumor infiltration in basal cell carcinoma. Two thousand-sixteen basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were documented in terms of age, anatomic location, tumor diameter, initial excision depth, safety margin, histologic type, and the position of tumor outgrowths as determined by three-dimensional histologic study of the tumor margins in paraffin sections (micrographic surgery). The extent of each subsequent excision was recorded until tumor-free tissue was reached. The results showed that BCCs have a highly irregular infiltration pattern and a predilection for small, fingerlike outgrowths whose bases occupy 1-30 degrees of the tumor circumference. When superficial extension was expressed mathematically, the resulting exponential functions varied highly significantly (P = .001) according to histologic tumor type and diameter. The resulting curves permitted very precise prediction of the probability of tumor-positive margins (ie, subtotal excision), depending on the safety margin, histologic tumor type, and tumor diameter. For example, the probability of tumor-positive margins after excision of a BCC up to 10 mm in diameter is 30% with a safety margin of 2 mm, 16% with a safety margin of 3 mm, and 5% with a safety margin of 5 mm. The probability of tumor-positive margins for fibrosing primary BCCs 10-20 mm in diameter is 48, 34, and 18% with safety margins of 2, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Recurrent tumors have a significantly higher probability of positive margins (P = .001) than primary ones. Anatomic location and tumor age affect subclinical extension only indirectly. 
An outbreak of designer drug--related deaths in Pennsylvania 3-Methylfentanyl ("China White") is a "designer" opiate that has caused more than 100 overdose deaths in California since 1979, but that has not been associated previously with deaths east of the Rocky Mountains. During 1988, 3-methylfentanyl was identified in 16 fatal overdose cases in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, contributing to a fourfold rise in overdose mortality during October of that year. Morphine was detected in the blood of five persons (31%) and cocaine in the blood of three persons (19%) dying of 3-methylfentanyl overdoses; these were demographically similar to 99 other fatal overdose cases investigated by the county coroner from 1986 through 1988. This documents the contribution of 3-methylfentanyl to overdose mortality in an eastern city and the use of 3-methylfentanyl with other illegal drugs. Drug abusers in the northeastern United States should be considered at risk for more "designer drug" overdose outbreaks in the future. 
Serum hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatitis B virus seropositive and seronegative patients with normal liver function. The presence of hepatitis type B virus (HBV) DNA in serum specimens from 926 apparently healthy people with normal liver functions was determined by polymerase chain reaction; 41.2% of people with positive results for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (94 of 228) and 95.2% of people with positive results for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) (60 of 63) were found to have positive results for serum HBV DNA. On the other hand, serum HBV DNA was found in 11.0% (77 of 698) of HBsAg-negative people and in 13% (69 of 530) of those who had positive results for serum antibodies directed against HBsAg. The results seem to suggest that HBV DNA can be found in a significant portion of apparently healthy people with normal liver function who are either seronegative for HBsAg or seropositive for antibodies directed against HBsAg. 
Posterior spinal fusion in Sotos' syndrome. Sotos' syndrome (synonym: cerebral gigantism) is the association of mental retardation, macrocephaly and prenatal onset of accelerated growth. The rapid skeletal growth may account for a 4% incidence of scoliosis. General anaesthesia using halothane or enflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen, with opioid supplementation and labetalol to induce moderate hypotension, appeared to be a satisfactory technique for corrective spinal surgery. The potential problems are discussed, with mental retardation and sometimes aggressive behaviour contraindicating a "wake-up" test. Extradural somatosensory evoked potential monitoring is a satisfactory alternative. Hook failures seem more likely than in patients undergoing surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. 
Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and risk of fatal coronary heart disease Among the 356,222 men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial who had no history of hospitalization for heart attack at entry, more than 2,000 coronary deaths occurred during 6 years of follow-up. With this large data set, detailed cross-tabulations clearly and simply showed the strong graded relation between blood pressure and coronary heart disease death. This risk gradient was evident in each of five age groups ranging from 35 to 57 years and for levels of diastolic blood pressure ranging from less than 75 mm Hg to greater than 115 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease death than was diastolic blood pressure, and isolated systolic blood pressure elevation was found to be an important risk factor in these middle-aged men. The risk of coronary death was increased among hypertensive men who had elevated serum cholesterol levels or who smoked cigarettes. Because less than 10% of hypertensive men had cholesterol levels in the lowest quintile (below 182 mg/dl) and were nonsmokers, a multi-intervention approach for the large majority of hypertensive persons is clearly indicated. Risks of death were also substantially increased among those hypertensive men who already had end-organ damage, emphasizing the importance of early treatment to prevent such damage. These findings have implications for the design of prevention trials and clinical practice, as it is clear that systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure should be considered in treating hypertensive patients. Additionally, treatment goals should be directed at preventing not only death but many other morbid events, clinical and subclinical, that are associated with elevated blood pressure and that are preventable with appropriate treatment. 
Non-trauma mortality in elderly women with low bone mineral density. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. 9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes. 
Is deleting the digital rectal examination a good idea? Many groups have taken the position that the digital rectal examination should be discontinued as part of the annual screening physical examination. We examined the effects of not doing a digital rectal examination on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The average time since a previous rectal examination increased as the stage of cancer increased. The digital rectal examination proved to be a relatively insensitive test, with 40% of stage D cancers being detected initially within 12 months of the most recent examination. Nevertheless, an annual digital rectal examination did detect a greater percentage of lower stage (and thus more localized and potentially curable) cancers when repeated within 12 months. When the last rectal examination was more than 24 months previous, cancers detected were more likely to be advanced. Without a digital rectal examination, patients would have their disease detected only by the presence of symptoms. When it was done because of symptoms, 81% of our patients had stage D cancers compared with 32% of stage B and 38% of stage C patients. Without the routine use of this examination, patients with prostate cancer would be more likely to have higher stage and less potentially curable lesions at the time of diagnosis. We conclude that the digital rectal examination remains an important part of routine annual physical examinations. 
Arterial stent placement with use of the Wallstent: midterm results of clinical experience. Self-expandable stents of the Wallstent type were used in 26 iliac and 15 femoropopliteal artery lesions of 31 patients to treat stenoses or occlusions. The indications were confined to complex lesions, including residual stenoses and dissections after percutaneous procedures or previous surgery in the iliac artery lesions, and long-segment (mean, 13.5 cm) occlusions with inadequate response to percutaneous recanalization in the femoropopliteal artery lesions. In the iliac artery group, after stent placement, 96% of the lesions were patent at a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-30 months). In the femoropopliteal artery group, of 11 patients available for follow-up, only six had patent stents at 7-26 months (mean, 20 months). Four of these six patients required one to three secondary interventions. Self-expanding endoprostheses are of great value in complex iliac artery lesions where simple balloon dilation is insufficient. Stent placement for long femoral artery lesions should be performed with utmost reserve, and the extent of stent placement should be as short as possible. 
Renal cell carcinoma in young and old patients. Comparison of prognostic pathologic variables (cell type, tumor grade and stage, and DNA ploidy pattern) and their impact on disease outcome. A group of 41 young patients (age less than or equal to 40 years; mean, 35.7 years) and a group of 34 old patients (age greater than or equal to 80 years; mean, 82.4 years) who underwent operation for renal cell carcinoma between 1970 and 1986 were compared. Sex, grade, and DNA ploidy pattern distributions were similar between the groups. Granular cell and papillary cancers with lower stages at presentation were more common among the young. In patients with high-stage disease, 73 percent of the older group but none of the younger had DNA diploid tumors. Low-stage clear cell carcinoma caused cancer death only in the young. Stage I nondiploid clear cell carcinomas were associated with death (33%) only in the young. Overall, death rates seem similar for both groups but among the young most (63%) occurred with low-stage disease and a nondiploid pattern only; among the old, 88 percent occurred with high-stage disease and independent of DNA ploidy pattern. 
Complications of pregnancy and delivery in relation to psychosis in adult life: data from the British perinatal mortality survey sample. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate whether events occurring at or around the time of birth contribute to the onset of psychotic illness in adult life. DESIGN-Pregnancy and birth complications as possible causes of adult mental illness were studied in the population sample of the British perinatal mortality survey. Subsequent psychiatric admissions were independently identified through the Mental Health Enquiry and records of regional and special health authorities. Logistic regression was used to compare data on perinatal deaths with those on survivors to determine factors independently associated with perinatal death, and this equation was then used to calculate the risk of perinatal death for each survivor. SUBJECTS--16,980 people born in a single week in 1958 (the British perinatal mortality survey sample), including 252 patients admitted to psychiatric care; case notes of 235 patients were supplied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Patients with a schizophrenic illness (whether defined by "broad" (n = 57) or "narrow" (n = 35) diagnostic criteria) did not have a greater mean risk of perinatal death than the population in general, but there was some evidence of increased liability (relative risk 2.43; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 5.05) for those with affective psychosis (n = 32). Specific high risk variables for affective psychosis were decreased gestation time (273.9 v 281.2 days; mean difference 7.3 days, 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 11.5; p less than 0.002) and prescription of vitamin K to the child in the first week of life (19% of patients v 5% of controls, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS--The findings give no support to theories that factors predicting perinatal mortality contribute significantly to causation of schizophrenic illness. Further investigation of decreased gestation length in relation to affective disorder is required. 
Coronary artery thrombolysis: comparison of approved agents. Three agents approved for the lysis of thrombi in coronary arteries--alteplase, anistreplase and streptokinase--have undergone critical clinical experimental trials in Europe and the United States. Global comparison of their efficacy shows that alteplase is slightly more effective (71 percent) in restoring patency than anistreplase (60 percent) and streptokinase (58 percent). Streptokinase and anistreplase are allergenic, and repeat administration is not feasible in the short-term, a distinct advantage for alteplase. More accurate dosing of thrombolytic agents and skillful use of aspirin and heparin improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy but can also increase the risk of bleeding. A recanalization rate of 90 percent or more could be achieved if the thrombolytic agent is administered within the first hour after thrombosis. Administration this soon after the development of thrombosis may be possible if the agent is given outside the hospital by practicing physicians or, perhaps, paramedics. 
Cerebrospinal fluid protein and opening pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). We studied the relationship between the CSF protein concentration and the degree of elevation of the CSF opening pressure in 177 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). There was no linear correlation between the CSF protein and opening pressure. In addition, low CSF protein (less than 20 mg/dl) was present in only 26% of the patients. Our findings fail to confirm previous reports of an inverse relationship between the CSF opening pressure and CSF protein as well as low CSF protein in these patients. 
Delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula in a patient with traumatic brain injury. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are rare complications of traumatic brain injury, facial trauma and postorthognathic surgery. A high level of clinical suspicion is necessary, particularly for patients who are unable to communicate, to establish the diagnosis. A case of delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula after traumatic brain injury is presented. This case illustrates that early recognition of this disorder is crucial to prevent significant morbidity. 
Hydrops fetalis in the McKusick-Kaufman syndrome: a case report. McKusick-Kaufman syndrome is an autosomal recessive multiple malformation syndrome characterized by hydrometrocolpos and polydactyly. We report on a patient with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and severe hydrops. This case illustrates the necessity of genetic evaluations for all patients with unexplained hydrops. 
Monoclonal antibody YB5.B8 identifies the human c-kit protein product. The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a 145- to 160-Kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family and is allelic with the murine white spotting locus (W). W mutations affect several aspects of hematopoiesis, most notably erythroid progenitors and mast cells. A monoclonal antibody, YB5.B8, had been raised against the leukemic blasts of a patient with M1-type acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and it precipitates a 150-Kd cell surface glycoprotein from leukemic cells. The YB5.B8 epitope is expressed on mast cells, on up to 3% of normal mononuclear bone marrow cells, and it identifies a sub-group of AML patients with a poor prognosis. In view of similarities noted between the cell surface antigen identified by YB5.B8 and the c-kit protein product, we performed experiments to determine whether they are identical. c-kit RNA expression in the cell lines HEL (human erythroleukemia) and A172 (glioblastoma) was shown to parallel the expression of the YB5.B8 epitope in these lines as measured by flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-kit serum and YB5.B8 antibody indicated that the two antibodies identified proteins of identical size in HEL (155 Kd) and A172 (145 Kd) cells, and sequential immunoprecipitations with the kit and the YB5.B8 antibodies demonstrated that the two antibodies recognize the same molecule. The proteins identified by both the anti-kit and YB5.B8 antibodies displayed in vitro autophosphorylation activity in immune complex kinase assays. In addition, YB5.B8 was able to inhibit the binding of the kit ligand to HEL cells. These studies provide evidence that the YB5.B8 antigen and the c-kit protein product are identical and raise certain hypotheses regarding the role of c-kit in AML. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: a clinical, pathological, and flow cytometric study. Of 345 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex evaluated at the Mayo Clinic from 1950 to 1989, 23 were identified as having brain tumors. In 20 of the 23, histological or clinical evidence showed the tumor to be a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. A search of the Mayo Clinic tissue registry yielded 73 giant cell-containing astrocytomas and intraventricular gliomas exclusive of ependymomas. Reexamination revealed no further examples of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in patients without features of the tuberous sclerosis complex. Considerable histological variation was observed in the 15 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas subjected to critical microscopic review. It is of note that no correlation was noted between either the histological features, such as atypia, mitoses, endothelial proliferations, necrosis, or the flow cytometric characteristics and the clinical course or the survival time of the patients. 
Drivers with untreated sleep apnea. A cause of death and serious injury. Three patients with untreated sleep apnea fell asleep while driving and caused serious automobile accidents. One person died, another became permanently paraplegic, and the three patients with sleep apnea were seriously injured in these crashes. This sequela of sleep apnea is not surprising, since subjects with sleep apnea may be poor drivers with a high accident rate and a high incidence of "near-miss" vehicular incidents. Because drivers with untreated sleep apnea may cause a large number of preventable automobile accidents, physicians have specific duties involving these drivers. First, physicians must try to identify impaired drivers with sleep apnea before they have an accident; routinely asking patients about loud snoring and hypersomnolence may help identify these impaired drivers. Second, physicians must consider the diagnosis of sleep apnea when examining patients who fall asleep while driving. Next, physicians must warn their patients with sleep apnea about the risks of driving with untreated sleep apnea. Finally, physicians must treat any seriously impaired driver with sleep apnea and keep these patients from driving until they can receive successful treatment. 
Chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in congenitally immunodeficient SCID and nude mice. Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) and athymic National Institutes of Health (NIH)-III (bg/nu/xid) mice were evaluated for susceptibility to Cryptosporidium parvum infections as neonates and as adults after challenge with inocula of 5 x 10(4) and 1 x 10(6) oocysts/mouse, respectively. SCID and NIH-III nude mice developed chronic infections that persisted over 12 weeks. Cryptosporidial organisms were observed in the small and large intestines of all mice. Colonization of the gallbladder and hepatobiliary duct epithelium occurred in a majority of the NIH-III nude mice and a smaller number of the SCID mice. Severe infections in both mouse strains were associated with clinical deterioration followed by death. Signs in these mice included dehydration, icterus, and emaciation. Deaths apparently resulted from hepatic dysfunction. Control mice experienced transient infections with no clinical signs. Immunodeficient mice should prove useful in studies of disease pathogenesis and in evaluating potential anticryptosporidial agents. 
Basaloid monomorphic adenomas. Monomorphic adenomas can be divided into basaloid and nonbasaloid type. With the exception of the canalicular adenoma, the basaloid monomorphic adenomas are preponderantly tumors of the major salivary glands, most often the parotid gland. The dermal analogue monomorphic adenomas, so named because of their histologic similarity to eccrine tumors of the skin, are a unique subset of the basaloid adenomas. They are often multifocal, recur frequently, may undergo malignant change, and can be part of a salivary-cutaneous tumor diathesis. 
Increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality associated with the diagonal earlobe crease: a prospective cohort study. PURPOSE: To ascertain whether the diagonal earlobe crease (ELC) is associated prospectively with future death or cardiac events over 8 years of follow-up in two sets of patients: those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those without evidence for CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 108 patients in four cohorts (each matched for age, sex, and race, but differing in the presence or absence of both a diagonal ELC and CAD in 1979 to 1982). Follow-up information was gathered by telephone interviews, and dates and causes of death were determined by reference to death certificates (n = 48), hospital records (n = 9), or attending physician statements (n = 1). RESULTS: During 8 to 10 years of follow-up, 58 of the patients had died. Patients with ELCs had poorer survival rates than those without creases, by stratified log-rank test (p = 0.006 for the cohorts thought not to have CAD, and p = 0.058 for those with CAD). Cardiac death rates (due to acute myocardial infarction, "sudden cardiac death," or heart failure) were also higher for patients with ELCs: 8.0 versus 0.9 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) in patients without CAD at entry, and 11.7 versus 3.7 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p = 0.008) in patients with CAD in 1979 to 1982. Cardiac event rates (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass surgery) were also higher in those with ELCs: 10.4 versus 1.4 events per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) for those without known CAD, and 15.8 versus 5.7 events per 100 patient-years (p = 0.009) for those with CAD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a diagonal ELC is associated with increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with ELCs may be at higher risk for coronary events, and might be especially cautioned to control or reduce other cardiac risk factors, even if currently without diagnostic evidence of CAD. 
Intratumoral DNA content variability. A study of non-small cell lung cancer. Twenty-eight resected primary non-small cell lung carcinomas were studied for intratumoral DNA variability by flow cytometry (FCM). Three separate tissue specimens from each resected tumor were divided equally for FCM analysis and histologic evaluation. FCM analysis also was performed on fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) from the center of the resected tumor. Histologically, there were 8 squamous carcinomas, 19 adenocarcinomas, and 1 large cell carcinoma. Twenty-three tumors (82%) were aneuploid, and 5 (18%) were diploid. The DNA index in aneuploid neoplasms ranged from 0.91 to 3.30 (mean, 1.64). All 5 diploid and 19 (83%) of the (23) aneuploid neoplasms manifested intratumoral DNA stability. Four (17%) of the aneuploid tumors showed regional DNA heterogeneity expressed as additional stemlines in at least one sample. The FNA yield was sufficient in 21 cases and inadequate for complete analysis in 7 cases. In general, good correlation between FNA and tissue analysis was obtained. However, in three of the aneuploid neoplasms, FNA materials did not reveal an additional nondominant stemline, as noted in the tissue specimens. The authors attribute this finding to a dilutional factor in the aspiration material. The authors conclude that most non-small cell lung carcinomas express DNA stability; FNA provides adequate cellular material for FCM in most cases. 
Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of aorta. Immediate and long-term results BACKGROUND. As angioplasty techniques have been refined and larger low-profile balloons developed, a nonsurgical approach to recoarctation has become available. Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure. However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients. This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old. Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients. Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery. Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05). There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%). Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg. Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months). Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up. Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation. 
Health risks of foreign travel. Preparing adults for jaunts abroad. Preparing adult travelers for journeys abroad can be challenging and rewarding. Prevention is the cornerstone of a safe, enjoyable trip. Patient education and commonsense precautions may well prevent infection or disease. Prophylaxis for diarrhea and malaria could save one day of illness or inconvenience on an expensive trip or may save a traveler's life. And the Loa loa worm? The nurse fortunately waited until it crawled from under her cornea. Then it was gently teased from under the bulbar conjunctiva. 
Diagnosis and treatment of muscle contraction (tension-type) headaches. Acute tension-type headache is a very common condition that rarely is a problem in treatment. Chronic tension-type headache, however, is often a difficult therapeutic problem. The pathogenesis is not well understood, but both peripheral muscle contraction and central pain-modulating systems are probably involved. Therapy usually works best when multiple techniques are used, including pharmacologic, psychological, and physiologic modalities. 
Propranolol in the management of recurrent migraine: a meta-analytic review. We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol. 
Increased cisplatin tissue levels with prolonged arterial infusion in the rat. Prolonged arterial infusions of cisplatin (DDP) have been effective in the treatment of regionally confined malignancies. It is unclear whether the route or schedule of DDP administration was responsible for the observed therapeutic benefit. To resolve this issue, tumor and normal tissue platinum (Pt) levels were determined in rats bearing hind-limb rat mammary tumors after intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) DDP infusions of constant dose and varying lengths. Infusions of DDP at 6 mg/kg were conducted IA over 30 minutes, and 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours and IV over 30 minutes and 48 hours. After infusion, Pt concentrations in solubilized tissue homogenates were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy. Maximum tumor Pt levels were seen after 48-hour IA infusion (29.3 micrograms Pt/mg tissue). IA infusions of 24 hours or less resulted in significantly lower Pt levels. Maximum tumor Pt concentration after IV administration was only 0.98 micrograms/mg tissue (48-hour infusion). Muscle Pt levels adjacent to the tumor were highest in the IA infused extremities, but at the 48-hour interval, were 53-fold less than tumor levels. Tumor and adjacent muscle Pt levels were not significantly different from each other after IV administration. This study provides pharmacologic evidence that lengthening the duration of IA DDP infusion increases tumor levels of Pt over that of IV or rapid IA administrations. The benefit of prolonged IA DDP infusions is dependent upon both route and schedule of drug administration. 
Acute and chronic hypothermia in a man with spinal cord injury: environmental and pharmacologic causes. It is well known that people with spinal cord injuries can develop hypothermia when exposed to an unusually cold environment. Hypothermia can also develop during inpatient rehabilitation, particularly as a side effect of certain medications. We present a patient with C4 incomplete spinal cord injury whose core body temperature was chronically subnormal, and who developed acute hypothermia on several occasions during inpatient rehabilitation. The results of tests of his autonomic function were abnormal. Acute hypothermia (core temperature approximately 34C) was induced when he was challenged with nifedipine. The serum level of phenytoin became elevated to toxic levels during two episodes of acute hypothermia, but the serum level of carbamazepine did not change appreciably. This case demonstrates that people with spinal cord injuries are at risk for hypothermia, that hypothermia can be induced by nifedipine, and that significant thermal challenges can occur during routine inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, hypothermia appears to affect the metabolism of phenytoin. 
Survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Results from a national prospective registry. OBJECTIVE: To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival. DESIGN: Registry with prospective follow-up. SETTING: Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. PATIENTS: Patients (194) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988. MEASUREMENTS: At diagnosis, measurements of hemodynamic variables, pulmonary function, and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables, medical history, and life-style. Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals. MAIN RESULTS: The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years (95% Cl, 1.9 to 3.7 years). Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows: at 1 year, 68% (Cl, 61% to 75%); at 3 years, 48% (Cl, 41% to 55%); and at 5 years, 34% (Cl, 24% to 44%). Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of III or IV, presence of Raynaud phenomenon, elevated mean right atrial pressure, elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure, decreased cardiac index, and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables: mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index. Such an equation, once validated prospectively, could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical resources. 
Cervical necrotizing fasciitis of odontogenic origin. Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe soft tissue infection caused by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and is characterized by a rapid extension along fascial planes and by necrosis of soft tissues. The disease rarely occurs in the head and neck. Three cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the neck after a dental infection are presented. The difficulty in diagnosing the early stage of this condition in relation to other soft tissue infections of odontogenic origin in the neck is discussed. The importance of an early diagnosis followed by an appropriate combination of medical, surgical, and dental treatment is emphasized. 
Longitudinal study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertensive pregnant women: deviations related to the development of superimposed preeclampsia. A prospective longitudinal study of 25 pregnant women (30 pregnancies) with chronic hypertension, a group prone to development of preeclampsia, was conducted to explore the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the development of superimposed preeclampsia. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58). Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups. However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed. Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester. Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased. These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis. 
An unusual presentation of salmonellal aortitis. Our patient represents what we believe to be the first documented case of Salmonella choleraesuis aortitis presenting as a salmonellal empyema in an elderly diabetic man. Although S choleraesuis often causes septicemia, its absence should not lead one to forget the pathogenic nature of and high mortality associated with this organism. Aggressive efforts must be made to search for endovascular infection, because cures can be achieved only with surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. 
Traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury: case report and selected review. An unusual case is described featuring traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury. An association between these is possible but not previously described. Coronary artery contusion, malignant arrhythmias, and a normal electrocardiogram were also noted and discussed. The relevant literature was reviewed. 
Insulin resistance and hypertension. While clinicians have long recognized the apparent increased prevalence of hypertension among diabetics, sophisticated epidemiological analyses begun in the early 1970s have established that hypertensive individuals are more prone to hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance than normotensive individuals. Subsequently, the several hypertensinogenic effects of insulin were carefully studied in a number of laboratories. Most recently, the association of these two relatively common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and insulin resistance, was broadened to include lipid abnormalities, namely, increased concentrations of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and decreased concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. These abnormalities, all of which appear in association more commonly than would be expected by chance, clearly predispose affected individuals to increased cardiovascular risk. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relations between insulin resistance and hypertension and focuses discussion on the role of insulin as a common link between them. It concludes with recommendations, based on today's knowledge, for behavioral and therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of increased cardiovascular risk. 
Direct mechanical ventricular actuation for cardiac arrest in humans. A clinical feasibility trial Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a non-blood-contacting method of biventricular cardiac massage which may be applied expediently for total circulatory support. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of DMVA application for patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Following informed consent, DMVA was applied in 22 patients. Vascular access for hemodynamic monitoring was possible in only 12 patients, whose outcomes serve as the basis for this report. The mean age of the patients was 48.2 +/- 4.2 years (seven men; five women). The average time from witnessed cardiac arrest to DMVA application was 81 +/- 9 minutes. Application took less than two minutes from the time of skin incision and resulted in immediate hemodynamic improvement. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures averaged 78 +/- 4 and 41 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, with a mean cardiac output of 3.14 +/- 0.18 L/min during a mean of 228 +/- 84 minutes of circulatory support (range, 25 minutes to 18 hours). In selected cases the device was temporarily removed for 2 to 3 minutes and open-chest cardiac massage (OCCM) performed at similar compression rates. DMVA increased arterial pressures 65 percent and cardiac output 190 percent compared to OCCM. Initial arterial pH (7.12 +/- 0.04) improved by the time the device was removed (7.24 +/- 0.05). Serum lactate levels decreased from 18.0 +/- 2.3 mumol/L to 14.9 +/- 2.9 mumol/L. Four patients were successfully defibrillated: two had inadequate cardiac function and died within 1 h, and two were successfully resuscitated, but later died from cardiac failure and respiratory insufficiency. Another patient regained normal neurologic function during DMVA and was successfully bridged to cardiopulmonary bypass for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, but died later from myocardial infarction. There were only two complications: (1) a cardiac laceration during pericardiotomy (1/22 patients); and (2) a ventricular rupture during OCCM (1/22). No complication resulted from the device. We found DMVA to be a feasible method for acute cardiovascular stabilization in victims suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Human clinical trials employing earlier DMVA application are required to determine its resuscitative potential. 
Effects of preoperative electrical stimulability and historical factors on performance with multichannel cochlear implant. We investigated the relationship between results of preoperative transtympanic electrical promontory stimulation, duration of deafness, postoperative implanted psychophysical results, and postoperative speech and speech sound recognition as indicated by a battery of five tests. Our subjects were 10 patients implanted with the Cochlear Corporation multielectrode implant, 1 year postimplantation, with a minimum of 17 active electrodes programmed in the bipolar + 1 mode. The results indicated that preoperative promontory thresholds, the slope of the threshold function, and the duration of auditory deprivation are excellent predictors of postoperative speech and speech sound recognition in the auditory (processor alone) mode. These results have significant implications for patient selection and counseling. 
Diagnosing and treating common oral pathologies. When the physician is confronted with an oral pathologic condition in a child, the adage "common things happen commonly" should be applied. Congenital lesions such as palatal and alveolar cysts occur in almost 50% of newborns. Developmental conditions such as Fordyce granules and retrocuspid papillae are found in most children. Localized soft-tissue enlargements commonly seen in young children include the parulis, mucocele, papilloma, and inflammatory gingival tumors. In addition, soft-tissue pathologies and discomfort associated with herpesvirus infections or recurrent aphthous ulcerations often present as a chief complaint. The physician's knowledge and treatment recommendations for common oral pathologies should be an integral component to the overall medical management of infants, children, and adolescents. 
Exercise. Practical treatment for the patient with depression and chronic fatigue. Exercise should be part of everyone's lifestyle, but may be a particularly important part of the treatment of patients with depression and chronic fatigue. It will reliably and consistently decrease feelings of tiredness and despondency, although it is seldom sufficient as a sole treatment intervention for such patients. When initiating an exercise program, a baseline assessment should be followed by an exercise prescription and an appropriate degree of patient education about exercise physiology. This should be followed, in addition to other treatment interventions, by regular follow-up visits to make appropriate adjustments; provide encouragement and motivation to continue; monitor weight, body fat, and nutrition; and assess the effectiveness of the program on the underlying problem. 
Extrapleural pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in the treatment of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma has been considered a uniformly fatal disease associated with a median survival of 4 to 18 months. Extrapleural pneumonectomy alone has proved disappointing in the treatment of this disease, as have chemotherapy and radiotherapy. From 1980 to 1990, 31 patients with pleural mesothelioma underwent multimodality therapy that included extrapleural pneumonectomy with resection of the pericardium and diaphragm. The age of the patients was 53.4 +/- 8.6 years; 26 were male. All patients had the pathologic diagnosis reviewed before treatment. At thoracotomy six patients had residual (unresectable) gross disease, and in 23 there was histologic evidence of disease at the resection margin. The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19% and 6%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay for the 29 patients who survived the operation was 10.9 +/- 3.5 days. Postoperatively 26 patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cis-platinum chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The survival rates were 70% at 1 year and 48% at 2 years. Trends toward improved survival in the patients with complete resections approached but did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that this multimodality protocol can be administered with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Prospective trials are justified to further clarify the role of this approach. 
Oncogene expression and oral cancer. Cancer of the oral cavity remains a major problem in the United States as well as in many other countries, some of which record as much as 30% of all their cancers to be in the oral region. Despite numerous advances in the fields of epidemiology and etiology, little is known of the molecular basis of oral cancer. Advances in the field of oncogenes have produced a tool to study the different stages of carcinogenesis, including transition from premalignant to malignant stages. These strategies have direct relevance to oral cancer where the premalignant stage is well defined. Preliminary studies into the expression and function of oncogenes suggest abnormalities including individual and multiple amplification of three or more types of these genes. This review briefly describes the concept of oncogenes, and their possible role in the development of neoplasia and specifically on studies in oral cancer. 
Effect of antibiotics on food intake and absorption of nutrients for children with diarrhea due to Shigella. The effect of antibiotic therapy on intake of food and absorption of nutrients for 19 male children aged 1-5 years with suspected shigella infection was studied. The children were admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells and white blood cells per high-power field in the stool. Microbiologic diagnosis was made within 48 hours of admission. On the basis of clinical and microbiologic criteria, children were classified as having mild or severe infection. Ten children with mild infection did not receive antibiotics, whereas nine children with severe infection were treated with ampicillin. After the children were rehydrated, a 72-hour balance study was carried out during the acute stage of infection with Shigella and was repeated 2 weeks after recovery. The levels of consumption of food and absorption of nutrients were estimated. During the acute stage of infection, such levels were higher for the children treated with antibiotics than for the untreated group. During the recovery phase, the levels of intake of food and absorption of nutrients were equal for both groups. Thus, children who are treated with appropriate antibiotics not only may recover from infection with Shigella more rapidly, but they also may be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently. 
Spontaneous common iliac arteriovenous fistula manifested by acute renal failure: a case report. Arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels resulting from spontaneous rupture of aneurysms are rare, with only 31 cases having been reported since 1971. Clinical diagnosis is possible when a unique set of findings is present, namely high-output cardiac failure, a pulsatile abdominal mass associated with a bruit or thrill, and unilateral arterial insufficiency or venous engorgement. Recently, with advancements in diagnostic techniques, the number of cases in which an arteriovenous fistula is found between the common iliac vessels has increased. Diagnosis can be difficult, however, as in the case of one of our patients in whom the predominant sign was acute renal failure. Other reports of renal failure or impairment in the presence of a common iliac fistula have also appeared. Awareness of this phenomenon can help the physician to establish the diagnosis when one or more of the classic signs are absent. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management have contributed to the high incidence of survival in patients with arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels. 
Insulinopenia as a risk factor in hepatectomy and its resolution by intraportal insulin administration. Insulopenia is a possible risk factor in hepatectomy, especially since insulin has been recognized to have a significant hepatotrophic effect. In the current study, insulinopenic patients were defined as those who showed abnormally low insulinogenic indexes (less than 0.6) on the oral glucose tolerance test, compared with those in 22 normal volunteers (1.16 +/- 0.57, mean +/- SD). The insulinogenic index represents the ratio of the cumulative enhancement of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to the glucose level (delta IRI/delta glucose). Surgical outcomes were studied retrospectively in 17 insulinopenic patients who underwent hepatic resections from January 1987 to July 1988. Six of 10 patients in the major hepatic resection group showed postoperative complications, 5 of whom experienced hepatic failure resulting in hospital death. By contrast, all seven patients in the minor resection group tolerated the operations. From August 1988, intraportal insulin was prospectively administered as a posthepatectomy management technique to nine patients, eight of whom were diagnosed as insulinopenic. These patients all tolerated major hepatic resections including four hepatic vascular exclusion procedures with veno-venous bypass. In conclusion, the current study indicates that insulinopenic patients are high-risk candidates for major hepatic resection and that intraportal insulin administration has a beneficial effect on the postoperative management of these patients. 
Sugar in the reduction of incarcerated prolapsed bowel. Report of two cases. Incarcerated, prolapsed rectum, colostomies, and ileostomies, when viable, may be reduced using ordinary table sugar. The placing of sugar granules on the incarcerated bowel results in a decrease in tissue edema and spontaneous bowel reduction. The technique, case reports, and a review of the literature are herein reported. 
Modification of the Bankart reconstruction with a suture anchor. Report of a new technique. We assessed the effectiveness of a new suture anchor that has been designed to anchor sutures into a blind, straight hole drilled in bone. The strength of fixation in glenoid bone is 67 N for the No. 0 anchor and suture, and 82 N for the No. 2 device with suture. During 1988 and 1989, 32 patients underwent a modified Bankart reconstruction for recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability at two centers as part of a prospective study of this modified technique. There were no complications as a result of the technique. The four surgeons involved agreed that the suture anchor simplified the procedure. Seventeen patients have been reviewed, with more than 1 year followup. Ninety-four percent had good to excellent results according to the Bankart rating scale. There was one recurrent dislocation in a football player. 
Clinical implications of late proven patency after successful coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has changed the pattern of intervention in coronary artery disease. However, the long-term results in patients undergoing successful, elective, native-vessel PTCA are not yet fully characterized. Because the healing and subsequent proliferative response after angioplasty are time related, it was the purpose of the present study to determine the long-term outcome in patients whose dilated arteries have been demonstrated to be patent 4-12 months after successful, uncomplicated PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. The patients were grouped on the basis of the 4-12 month catheterization into those whose vessels were angiographically "normal" or had luminal irregularities only at the PTCA sites (396 patients), those whose vessels also had luminal irregularities elsewhere with or without PTCA site luminal irregularities (680 patients), and those with significant obstructive disease (more than 50% diameter narrowing) at sites other than the PTCA sites (426 patients). Of 1,502 such patients, long-term follow-up was available in 1,491. At the time of the original angioplasty, the normal patients had a 1.8% incidence of multivessel disease; luminal irregularity patients, 9.4%; and obstructive disease patients, 58.7%. At angiographic restudy, 16.4% of the obstructive disease patients continued to have multivessel disease. The patients were followed for the events of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, and repeat PTCA. The 6-year survival rate was 95%; cardiac survival, 96%; and freedom from all events, 65%. The strongest correlate of events during follow-up was the angiographic status of the undilated segments. At 6 years, freedom from cardiac events was noted in 77% of the normal group, 61% of the luminal irregularity group, and 55% of the obstructive disease group. Diabetes and hypertension were also independent correlates of events. CONCLUSIONS. Results from the present study show that associated disease in undilated segments is a strong predictor of late events in patients after successful, uncomplicated, reatenosis-free PTCA. However, the need for further revascularization was frequent even in patients without obstructive disease. Completeness of revascularization is appropriate when possible, and limiting progression of coronary disease at sites remote from those dilated should improve on these late results. 
Eosinophiluria in atheroembolic renal disease. PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Eosinophiluria has been reported in acute interstitial nephritis and other renal diseases, but its presence in atheroembolic renal disease (AERD) has not been previously established. AERD has been identified as a cause of acute and chronic renal failure, particularly in elderly patients with advanced atherosclerosis and in those patients who have undergone manipulation or intervention of the abdominal aorta, renal artery, or coronary artery. The definitive diagnosis is made by renal biopsy. However, many patients are too acutely ill to tolerate renal biopsy and, in recent years, peripheral eosinophilia, hypocomplementemia, and thrombocytopenia have been recognized in association with AERD. Previous studies have reported that AERD is associated with an inactive renal sediment and an absence of urine eosinophils. We reviewed our experience over a 4-year period with 24 patients with renal biopsy-proven AERD. RESULTS: Urine eosinophils were evaluated in nine patients to help determine the cause of their renal deterioration. Seven of these patients presented with evidence of vascular disease. Three patients had procedures involving manipulation of the abdominal aorta. Physical examination revealed findings of atheroembolism in three of nine patients. Overall, eight of nine patients had a positive Hansel's stain for eosinophiluria. Six of eight patients had more than 5% of their urinary white cell count as eosinophils. The reason for failure of previous studies to detect eosinophiluria in AERD is unclear but may have been related to the use of Wright's stain instead of Hansel's stain. CONCLUSION: In the evaluation of acute renal insufficiency, eosinophiluria may indicate AERD in addition to the other known causes for this finding. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk for chronic renal disease OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for chronic renal disease associated with regular use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study. PATIENTS: Patients were 554 North Carolina residents (age range, 30 to 79 years) hospitalized between 1980 and 1982 with a discharge diagnosis indicating newly diagnosed chronic renal dysfunction and a serum creatinine level consistently at or above 130 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL). Controls were 516 persons chosen randomly by telephone screening (if younger than 65 years of age) and from listings of Medicare recipients (if 65 years of age or older), frequency-matched to patients by age, race, sex, and proximity to study hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Data on use of prescription NSAIDs and other analgesics before 1980, other risk factors, and potential confounders were obtained by telephone interviews. Patients were classified by frequency and duration of use; daily users were those who took an NSAID for at least 360 consecutive days. MAIN RESULTS: A twofold risk for chronic renal disease was associated with previous daily use of NSAIDs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% Cl, 1.1 to 4.1). Increased risk was predominantly limited to men older than 65 years, for whom the odds ratio for daily use was 10.0 (Cl, 1.2 to 82.7) after adjusting for use of other analgesics. In other age-sex groups, the risk associated with NSAID use tended to be increased among those with heart disease or other factors that might indicate compromised renal circulation. These findings did not result from confounding by known renal disease risk factors and were not readily explained by potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of NSAIDs may increase the risk for chronic kidney disease in some high-risk groups. With the recent over-the-counter availability and increasing popularity of NSAIDs, the possibility of an increased risk for chronic renal disease associated with their use may warrant further scrutiny. 
The fixateur interne in the reduction and stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures in patients with neurologic deficit. A prospective analysis of 80 consecutive patients who underwent stabilization with the fixateur interne for thoracolumbar spine fractures with complete or incomplete paraplegia was undertaken to determine the results after bone healing. Follow-up examination at an average of 35 months (minimum, 24 months) included all 76 patients still alive. One patient died from a pulmonary embolism, and there were three other unrelated deaths. The mean wedge angle of the fractured vertebra was corrected from 17.4 degrees to 7.9 degrees and remained almost unchanged after 1 year (8.4 degrees) and 2 years, or 1 year after implant removal (8.2 degrees). Also, the wedge index showed nearly no bony loss of correction within the reduced fracture vertebra (0.61 before operation, 0.83 after operation; 0.81 at 1-year follow-up, 0.81 at 2-year follow-up, respectively). In the kyphosis angle measured by the Cobb method, however, there was a loss of 5 degrees after implant removal within the next year because of the disc space collapsed above the fractured vertebra. In this series, 70% of the cases had no formal fusion. All 29 cases of translational displacement of 4-36 mm were anatomically reduced. No neurologic or vascular complication occurred. Posterolateral fusion or transpedicular interbody fusion in the disrupted disc space is recommended. 
Somato-somatic referred pain caused by suprasegmental spinal cord tumor. Tactile stimulation of a coin-sized area in a T-2 dermatome consistently triggered a lancinating pain in the ipsilateral C-8 dermatome in a 38-year-old woman. The SEP and an MRI led to a diagnosis of a tumor at the left cervico-medullary junction, much higher than the clinically suspected level. Surgical exploration revealed an exophytic glioma, and the pain was abolished postoperatively. Ephaptic transmission at the tumor site was suspected as a pathophysiologic mechanism. 
Nasogastric feeding at home: acceptability and safety. A questionnaire was administered to 70 families with experience of home enteral nutrition. All but one patient received at least some of their feeding overnight. During 11,041 patient days of home enteral nutrition, no serious complications were seen. Sleep disturbance was common, however, and affected 59 parents and 35 children. A nocturnal cough or 'chestiness' were noted in 10 children suggesting occult gastro-oesophageal reflux. Enteral feeding disposables were not prescribable by general practitioners, and funding for the equipment was inadequate in the hospital and community. The mean time to arrange funding for equipment was eight months (range two weeks to two years). Parental views on home enteral nutrition were positive and none felt that its disadvantages outweighed the benefits. Altogether 35 children were described as being more happy and active. Given adequate preparation and continued support at home, parents can manage home enteral nutrition safely and effectively. 
The role of beta 2-microglobulin in peptide binding by class I molecules. Efficient transport of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules to the cell surface requires association of the class I heavy chain with endogenous peptide and the class I light chain, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M). A mutant cell line deficient in beta 2M transports low amounts of nonpeptide-associated heavy chains to the cell surface that can associate with exogenously provided beta 2M and synthetic peptide antigens. Normal beta 2M-sufficient cells grown in serum-free media devoid of beta 2M also require an exogenous source of beta 2M to efficiently bind synthetic peptide. Thus, class I molecules on normal cells do not spontaneously bind or exchange peptides. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: occurrence in a child after reconstructive surgery. The occurrence of the rare but potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be considered by the surgeon treating a patient who develops hyperthermia, mental abnormalities, autonomic instability, and muscle rigidity after exposure to phenothiazines or other neuroleptic drugs. The dopamine agonist bromocriptine appears to be the treatment of choice in adults and seemed to be effective and well tolerated in our patient. Although the syndrome cannot be prevented, recognition is crucial, since effective general and specific therapy is available. Differentiating neuroleptic malignant syndrome from malignant hyperthermia allows early appropriate treatment with bromocriptine. 
Celiomesenteric anomaly and aneurysm: clinical and etiologic features. The development of aneurysmal disease involving the rarely encountered celiomesenteric anomaly is extremely unusual. Aneurysmal disease of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries is itself an extremely uncommon finding, accounting for less than 10% of all visceral artery aneurysms. The existence of aneurysmal disease involving a celiomesenteric anomaly has been alluded to only briefly in two previous clinical reports. We review the case of a young woman with aneurysmal disease involving a common celiomesenteric trunk. The patient underwent excision of the aneurysm with successful vascular reconstruction. Although extremely unusual, the development of this extremely rare lesion can be predicted on the basis of specific etiologic theories. Variations in the patterns of embryologic formation of the visceral arteries account for the development of celiomesenteric anomalies, whereas atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and infection lead to the development of most visceral aneurysms. Surgical treatment of celiac or mesenteric aneurysms is almost always indicated. Awareness of potential vascular anomalies and patterns of collateral circulation are necessary for appropriate surgical intervention. 
Thymic tumorigenesis induced by overexpression of p56lck. The lck gene encodes a membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinase (p56lck) that is believed to participate in lymphocyte-specific signal transduction pathways. To investigate the function of this molecule, transgenic mice were generated carrying the wild-type lck gene or a mutated lck gene encoding a constitutively activated form of p56lck (p56lckF505). Transgene expression in thymocytes was achieved in each case using the lck proximal promoter element. Mice expressing high levels of either p56lckF505 or p56lckY505 reproducibly developed thymic tumors. The sensitivity of thymocytes to p56lck-induced transformation suggests that disturbances in lck expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of some human neoplastic diseases. 
Nutritional support in the injured patient. After injury, the stress reaction causes hypermetabolism and consequent depletion of the body's tissues. Nutritional support should be begun early and should be given by the enteral route if possible. New developments may allow the modulation of the stress and immune responses by nutrient therapy. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage: external validation and extension of a model for prediction of 30-day survival. We report validation of a previously reported logistic regression model for predicting 30-day survival after supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage using independent, prospectively collected data. The original model, using initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, hemorrhage size, and pulse pressure, accounted for mortality or survival at 30 days in 92% of patients in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank with a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.96. For external validation, the model was used to predict 30-day status for each patient in the Main Phase Stroke Data Bank for whom complete risk factor information was available. Overall, 90% of patients' outcomes were correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.92. Two factors not collected in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank, hyperglycemia and intraventricular hemorrhage extension, were assessed to determine if they provided additional predictive information on 30-day mortality. Intraventricular hemorrhage extension contributed significant predictive information in a logistic regression, whereas hyperglycemia did not. The resulting four-factor model with an interaction term (intraventricular hemorrhage extension and Glasgow Coma Scale score) correctly classified the survival status of 94% of patients at 30 days. A more general outcome, death or failure to achieve a "good" Activities of Daily Living Score by one year, was analyzed with respect to the same four factors. The resulting model correctly classified 95% of the patients in the cohort. 
Concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance in patients with preeclampsia and its relation to severity of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (endoxin) was measured in pregnant patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The mean level was significantly higher than that in healthy control subjects (p less than 0.001). Patients with eclampsia had a significantly higher concentration than did women with preeclampsia (p less than 0.03). A positive significant correlation was found between concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance and the value of the index of gestosis of von Goecke and Schwabe (p less than 0.03). Analysis of patterns during various kinds of therapy revealed that nitrendipine was most effective in lowering endoxin concentration. Although an insignificant correlation was found between maternal concentration and both birth and placental weights, the compartmental differences observed seem to suggest fetoplacental origin of this substance. 
PEEP inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in dogs. The effects of an increase in alveolar pressure on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) have been reported variably. We therefore studied the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on pulmonary hemodynamics in 13 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternately in hyperoxia [inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) 0.4] and in hypoxia (FIO2 0.1). In this intact animal model, HPV was defined as the gradient between hypoxic and hyperoxic transmural (tm) mean pulmonary arterial pressure [Ppa(tm)] at any level of cardiac index (Q). Ppa(tm)/Q plots were constructed with mean transmural left atrial pressure [Pla(tm)] kept constant at approximately 6 mmHg (n = 5 dogs), and Ppa(tm)/PEEP plots were constructed with Q kept constant approximately 2.8 l.min-1.m-2 and Pla(tm) kept constant approximately 8 mmHg (n = 8 dogs). Q was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava. Pla(tm) was held constant by a balloon catheter placed by left thoracotomy in the left atrium. Increasing PEEP, from 0 to 12 Torr by 2-Torr increments, at constant Q and Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) from 14 +/- 1 (SE) to 19 +/- 1 mmHg in hyperoxia but did not affect Ppa(tm) (from 22 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 1 mmHg) in hypoxia. Both hypoxia and PEEP, at constant Pla(tm), increased Ppa(tm) over the whole range of Q studied, from 1 to 5 l/min, but more at the highest than at the lowest Q and without change in extrapolated pressure intercepts. Adding PEEP to hypoxia did not affect Ppa(tm) at all levels of Q. 
Corynebacterium parvum versus bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant immunotherapy of stage II malignant melanoma. Two separate studies have been reported comparing Corynebacterium parvum and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as adjuvant immunotherapy for stage II melanoma patients (The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 48 patients; Southeastern Cancer Study Group [SECSG], 162 patients). As the criteria for patient selection and drugs used were similar, we have pooled the data to analyze the effects of these two treatments. Both studies used BCG (Tice, Chicago, IL) 3 x 10(8) live organisms per treatment by Tine technique and C parvum (Burroughs-Wellcome, Triangle Park, NC) subcutaneous at a dose of 4 mg/m2 (SECSG) or 5 micrograms/m2 (Hershey) per treatment. The only difference in these studies was the frequency of immunization, with patients in Hershey receiving 22 doses and the SECSG patients receiving 55 doses during the 2-year period of treatment. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the 210 patients shows a prolonged disease-free interval for patients treated with C parvum (P = .02, two-sided Mantel procedure). In similar fashion, patients treated with C parvum had an improved survival rate (from all causes) when compared with BCG-treated patients (P = .012). An analysis of the results for the 170 patients for which the number of positive nodes was available was performed using Cox's model, with nodes as a stratification variable and with covariates of place, treatment, age, and sex. In this analysis, an observed benefit for C parvum on the disease-free interval had a P value of .37 while the benefit of C parvum on the survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .04. When the same analysis was performed using only patients aged younger than 60 years, the observed benefit of C parvum on disease-free interval had a P value of .08 and the benefit of C parvum on survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .008. 
The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system assessed in vivo by positron emission tomography in healthy volunteer subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. A group of healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated using positron emission tomography and two tracers as indicators of different specific properties of the presynaptic dopaminergic system in caudate nucleus and putamen. The first tracer, 6-L-(18F)-fluorodopa, was used as an analog of levodopa to assess its regional brain uptake, conversion into, and retention as dopamine and further metabolites. The second tracer, (11C)-nomifensine was employed as an indicator of striatal monaminergic reuptake sites that are principally dopaminergic. We have used this tracer to assess dopaminergic nerve terminal density. In patients with Parkinson's disease, striatal uptake of both tracers was decreased, putamen being significantly more affected than caudate. Side-to-side differences of uptake in putamen, but not caudate, correlated with corresponding left-right differences of scored clinical motor performance. Both 6-L(18F)-fluorodopa and (11C)-nomifensine tracer uptake in putamen was decreased on average to 40% of normal values, suggesting that a substantial part of the cellular elements of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system is still intact in living parkinsonian patients. This is in contrast to the generally extreme depletion of endogenous dopamine in the putamen of patients found at postmortem. Our results lend support to the search for drug treatments that protect against further nigrostriatal cell loss and that could be exhibited as soon as the disease manifests clinically. If successful, a sufficient striatal nerve terminal pool would remain so that the effectiveness of levodopa as a dopamine repletor could persist. 
Pathophysiology of cleft lip muscles following the initial surgical repair. Muscle biopsy specimens taken from the upper lip and perialar area during the time of secondary lip revision and studied by histochemical techniques demonstrate persistent connective-tissue and muscle abnormalities even at a distance from the cleft margins. Some of these changes are consistent with surgically induced denervation-reinnervation of muscle groups in the surgical field. Increased amounts of connective tissue also were found, most likely secondary to the original deformity and the subsequent surgical procedures. Both these changes may be important factors in subsequent abnormal growth and development of the underlying midfacial structures. This study also demonstrated the resolution of previously noted mitochondrial abnormalities found in the primary cleft lip patient. 
Role of echocardiography/Doppler in cardiogenic shock: silent mitral regurgitation. Two cases of cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema due to acute, severe, silent mitral regurgitation are discussed. The mechanism for the mitral regurgitation was papillary muscle rupture in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography established the presence, severity, and cause of the mitral regurgitation and the associated hyperdynamic left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Transesophageal echocardiography is excellent for assessing the mitral valve in critically ill patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography may be inadequate or misleading. This allowed for emergency mitral valve replacement without prolonged attempts at medical stabilization. 
Role of depressive illness in the outcome of treatment of temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the role of a depressive illness in the outcome of the treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome. One group was considered psychiatrically normal and the other had a concurrent depressive illness. The latter group was subdivided equally to produce three treatment groups: one undergoing occlusal splint therapy, one receiving antidepressant medication, and the third having a combination of occlusal splint and antidepressant therapy. The results showed clearly that there was a significant difference in response in the nonpsychiatric and combined-therapy depressed groups in comparison with the two depressed groups treated either with occlusal splint or with antidepressant therapy. The combined therapy led to resolution of the painful problem and the depression, whereas the single therapies were only partly successful in relieving the pain-dysfunction syndrome. The preexisting duration of this painful problem did not influence the response to therapy. 
Proximal rupture and intracoronary entrapment of a rotating device during low-speed rotational coronary angioplasty. While attempting to recanalize a right coronary artery obstruction by using a low-speed rotating catheter (Rotacs), proximal rupture of the catheter body occurred with entrapment of the blunt tip in the obstruction. To retrieve the device, it was necessary to severe the guiding catheter and the flexible tube of the Rotacs. At low-speed rotation the flexible segment of the catheter was then pulled back. 
Ceftazidime plus amikacin versus ceftazidime plus vancomycin as empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic children with cancer. Two antibiotic regimens, ceftazidime plus amikacin and ceftazidime plus vancomycin, were compared in a prospective, randomized clinical trial as empiric therapy in febrile granulocytopenic children with cancer. The rate of response was similar in the two groups (66% vs. 77%). The prevalence of secondary gram-negative bacteremia was higher--but not significantly higher--in the group receiving vancomycin. Adverse reactions also occurred more often in the latter group (35% vs. 4%). Mortality did not differ significantly in the two groups. Adjustment for independent predictors of response to treatment by means of multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of any remarkable difference between the responses to the two regimens. We conclude that the use of vancomycin instead of amikacin in combination with ceftazidime does not significantly improve the outcome of treatment of fever and infection in granulocytopenic children with cancer and that the use of vancomycin is associated with an increased frequency of both secondary infections due to gram-negative bacteria and adverse reactions. 
The role of behavioral research in the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas. Reduction in the prevalence of invasive diarrheal diseases can be facilitated by the development of models for systematic examination of behavioral risk factors that are associated with these illnesses. These factors include insufficient use of health care services, noncompliance with treatment, unhygienic behaviors, employment of poor feeding practices for infants and young children, and inappropriate handling of foods. Information on conditions that facilitate or constrain appropriate behaviors will assist the development of programs for the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas. 
External annular prosthesis in repair of biliary tract stricture. A surgical technique for treatment of benign intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary stenosis is described. It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments. This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile. It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line. The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years. Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result. The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days. 
Amplification of the c-erbB oncogene is associated with malignancy in primary tumours of neuroepithelial tissue. In various primary brain tumours of neuroepithelial tissue recombinant DNA techniques were used to demonstrate changes of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, which is homologous to the c-erbB oncogene. Twenty-one of 40 grade III/IV tumours, but only 1 of 16 grade I/II tumours were found to contain amplified and/or rearranged c-erbB sequences. This highly significant difference suggest that c-erbB amplification, rearrangement, or both, are important steps in malignant transformation in a subset of patients with neuroepithelial tumours. 
Effect of immersion on residual volume of able-bodied and spinal cord injured males. This study compared residual lung volumes (RV) (oxygen dilution technique) of able-bodied (AB) and spinal cord injured (SCI) males on dry land in air (RVA) and immersed to the neck in water (RVW). The effects of significant differences in RV on calculations of body density (Db) and percent body fat (%BF) were also assessed. The subjects were eight AB, eight paraplegic (PARA), and eight quadriplegic (QUAD) males, ranging in age from 18 to 51 yr. There was a 0.99 correlation (P less than 0.001) between RVA and RVW for AB subjects but no significant correlations between RVA and RVW for the PARA or QUAD groups. RVA in the QUAD group was significantly higher than in the PARA or AB group (P less than 0.003). There were no differences in RVW among the three groups. In the QUAD group, RVA was significantly larger than RVW (P less than 0.001), but there were no significant differences between RVA and RVW for the PARA or AB subjects. Db and %BF did not differ significantly among the PARA or AB groups when calculated at RVA and RVW. However, for QUAD, both Db and %BF differed significantly (P less than 0.001) when calculated at RVA and RVW. It was concluded that, for the purpose of hydrostatic weighing, residual lung volume of quadriplegic persons should be measured with the subject immersed in water. 
Specificities of serum alpha-fetoprotein in HBsAg+ and HBsAg- patients in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level is often elevated in patients with chronic liver disease and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. One of the most difficult problems frequently encountered in practice is differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from chronic liver disease. This study investigated the specificity and predictive value positive of serum alpha-fetoprotein at various levels in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, using 54 patients with histologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma and 200 patients with chronic liver disease (40 patients with chronic active hepatitis and 160 patients with cirrhosis) as nontumor controls. Among 254 patients, 170 (66.9%) were HBsAg+. A wide range of overlap (from 0 to 6,400 ng/ml) in the distribution of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease patients was observed mainly among HBsAg+ patients. In contrast, the overlapping range of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between HBsAg- patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease was remarkably narrow (from 0 to 200 ng/ml). Therefore the specificity and predictive value positive of alpha-fetoprotein at a given level were significantly lower in HBsAg+ than in HBsAg- patients, especially when alpha-fetoprotein was between 25 and 200 ng/ml. The specificities of alpha-fetoprotein at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 79.8% and 91.5%, respectively, whereas these specificities were both 100% in HBsAg- patients. The predictive values positive at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 53.6% and 72.5%, respectively, in contrast to 100% at both levels in HBsAg- patients. The serum alpha-fetoprotein level, which showed a predictive value positive of 95% in HBsAg+ hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 3,200 ng/ml, whereas that in HBsAg- hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 200 ng/ml. We conclude that serum HBsAg status should be considered when serum alpha-fetoprotein is measured as an independent test to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma, and suggest that regular serum alpha-fetoprotein determination may be more useful in HBsAg- patients with chronic liver disease for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma than in HBsAg+ patients. 
Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma in a patient with adrenal insufficiency. Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma is a rare disorder characterized by a proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells within the lumina of small vessels. The skin and central nervous system are typically affected; however, involvement of other organs has been described. We document an unusual case of this disorder in a patient who suffered clinically significant adrenal insufficiency and subsequently died. Autopsy disclosed angiotropic large-cell lymphoma involving both adrenal glands. 
Alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin in recurrent malignant glioma. The authors entered 43 patients with recurrent malignant glioma in a trial of alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin. Protocol design was alternating courses of BCNU (2 doses, 300 to 400 mg each) and cisplatin (2 doses, 150 to 200 mg each) each at 4-week to 6-week intervals. Eight of 40 patients (20%) evaluable after the first course of BCNU showed partial or minor response. Only 18 patients were evaluable after the first course of cisplatin, and 5 were evaluable after the second course of BCNU. Median survival was 9 months (range, 2 weeks to 6 years). Cerebral or ocular toxicity unique to this method of chemotherapy administration and failure to show clinical improvement were the most common reasons for removal from study. Because of the high attrition rate, the authors were unable to determine a meaningful response to alternating sequential BCNU and cisplatin or to test the clinical degree of cross-resistance to these agents in human malignant glioma. 
Use of process evaluation to guide health education in Forsyth County's project to prevent cervical cancer. The Forsyth County, NC, Cervical Cancer Prevention Project is a 5-year public health education program designed to increase the proportion of black women in the county who are appropriately screened for cervical cancer. In this paper, the authors report on process evaluation--the procedures used to monitor the intervention and to insure that the target population was reached with a high quality, community-based health education program. A system that encompasses documentation of program activities, interviews with women in waiting rooms of primary care providers, semiannual interviews with a panel of approximately 100 women from the target population, and telephone followup with participants in direct education workshops was designed and implemented. Through October 1990, more than 2,100 interviews had been conducted. Data from these activities have facilitated continued development and refinement of educational materials, provided guidance for developing new strategies for reaching the target population, and provided continuous feedback to program managers to allow monitoring the impact of all program activities. 
The herpes simplex virus 1 segment inversion site is specifically cleaved by a virus-induced nuclear endonuclease. Nuclear extracts from several tissue culture cell lines (human, primate, and murine) contain an endonuclease that specifically cleaves sequences at the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) segment inversion site. Mapping studies identified the preferential site of cleavage as a set of tandemly repeated dodecamers, the DR2 repeats. Endonuclease levels vary according to the proliferative state of the cell; little or no activity is detectable in extracts from quiescent cells, whereas high levels are expressed in dividing cells. Also, infection of density-arrested BSC-1 cells with HSV-1 induces a substantial increase (at least 35-fold) in endonucleolytic activity, which is first detectable at about 1 hr after infection at 32 degrees C. The elevated levels of enzyme activity then persist throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to the HSV-1 DR2 repeats, certain other G+C-rich sequences with an asymmetric distribution of purines and pyrimidines on the DNA strands and with appropriate sequences and lengths are substrates for the nuclease. These data indicate that target site recognition by the enzyme is conformation specific rather than sequence specific. 
Coarctation and hypoplasia of the aortic arch: will the arch grow? Hypoplasia of the transverse aortic arch of various degrees of severity is commonly seen in infants who have coarctation of the aorta. It is more often present when the coarctation is associated with intracardiac lesions that diminish or limit forward flow in the ascending aorta and promote right to left flow through an arterial duct. The increased frequency of surgical treatment of infants with complex coarctation, which is in part related to the ability to stabilize their condition with prostaglandin E1, has posed the question of the potential for growth and development of the originally hypoplastic aortic arch after conventional repair of aortic coarctation. Review of our experience with transverse aortic arch hypoplasia, found in 33 (32%) of 102 infants undergoing coarctation repair by subclavian flap aortoplasty or classic resection and end-to-end anastomosis, revealed excellent growth of the transverse arch after repair in all patients available for linear follow-up. The currently proposed extended arch repair should be reserved for the small group of infants with transverse aortic arch to ascending aorta diameter ratios (arch indices) of less than 0.25. 
Postblepharoplasty ectropion. Prevention and management. Lower-eyelid malposition is one of the more serious complications encountered following lower-lid blepharoplasty, ranging in severity from mild lower-lid retraction to frank ectropion with marked lower-lid eversion. We define a grading system for postblepharoplasty lid malposition based on the severity of lower-lid retraction. In a critical review of 111 patients who underwent lower-lid blepharoplasty between January 1985 and January 1990, 15% were thought to have some degree of lower-lid retraction. Presence of lid laxity preoperatively and increasing amounts of skin excision at surgery were significant factors in the development of malposition. Placement of orbicularis suspension sutures tended to decrease the incidence of lid retraction. No patients had frank ectropion; however, three patients with grade 2 or 3 malposition required a secondary surgical procedure for correction. All three patients had resolution of their symptoms and good cosmetic results using standard treatment methods. A literature review and discussion of the causes, sequelae, and management of post-operative ectropion is presented as a reminder to surgeons performing blepharoplasty. Avoidance of this entity by appropriate preoperative assessment is emphasized, along with conservative operative technique. These factors combined are essential for the successful outcome of lower-lid blepharoplasty. 
Arthroscopic stapling for detached superior glenoid labrum. Superior labral tears of the shoulder involve the biceps tendon and labrum complex which may be detached, displaced inferiorly, and interposed between the glenoid and the humeral head. We have treated ten young athletes with painful shoulders due to this lesion by arthroscopic stapling. Arthroscopy at the time of staple removal, after three to six months, showed that all the lesions had been stabilised. Clinical review at over 24 months showed an excellent or good result in 80%. The two relative failures were due in one to residual subacromial bursitis, and the other to multidirectional shoulder instability. Arthroscopic stapling can restore the shoulder anatomy, and it is recommended for active adolescent athletes with this lesion. 
A prospective, randomized trial comparing combination half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase with full-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator. Kentucky Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (KAMIT) Group. BACKGROUND. The potential benefits of combination thrombolytic agents in the treatment of myocardial infarction remain uncertain. In a small pilot study, we demonstrated that combining half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with streptokinase (SK) achieved a high rate of infarct vessel patency and a low rate of reocclusion at half the cost of full-dose t-PA. METHODS AND RESULTS. We designed a prospective trial in which 216 patients were randomized within 6 hours of myocardial infarction to receive either the combination of half-dose (50 mg) t-PA with streptokinase (1.5 MU) during 1 hour or to the conventional dose of t-PA (100 mg) during 3 hours. Acute patency was determined by angiography at 90 minutes, and angioplasty was reserved for failed thrombolysis. Heparin and aspirin regimens were maintained until follow-up catheterization at day 7. Acute patency was significantly greater after t-PA/SK (79%) than with t-PA alone (64%, p less than 0.05). After angioplasty for failed thrombolysis, acute patency increased to 96% in both groups. Marked depletion of serum fibrinogen levels occurred after t-PA/SK compared with t-PA alone at 4 hours (37 +/- 36 versus 199 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001) and persisted 24 hours after therapy (153 +/- 66 versus 252 +/- 75 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001). Reocclusion (3% versus 10%, p = 0.06), reinfarction (0% versus 4%, p less than 0.05), and need for emergency bypass surgery (1% versus 6%, p = 0.05) tended to be less in the t-PA/SK group. Greater myocardial salvage was apparent in the t-PA/SK group as assessed by infarct zone function at day 7 (-1.9 SD/chord versus -2.3 SD/chord after t-PA alone, p less than 0.05). In-hospital mortality (6% versus 4%) and serious bleeding (12% versus 11%) were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that a less expensive regimen of half-dose t-PA with SK yields superior 90-minute patency and left ventricular function and a trend toward reduced reocclusion compared with the conventional dose of t-PA. 
Fibrin glue vasal anastomosis compared to conventional sutured vasovasostomy in the rat. Vasectomy reversal has become a frequently performed surgical procedure with best results obtained with the use of the operating microscope and microsurgical technique. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the use of fibrin glue ("Tisseel", Immuno U.S., Inc.) for vasovasostomy and to compare this technique to conventional sutured vasovasostomy. Utilizing 60 male Sprague Dawley rats, a conventional two layered sutured anastomosis of vasovasostomy (30 rats) was compared to a fibrin glue technique of vasal anastomosis (30 rats). The fibrin glue technique was performed with two transmural sutures, was unstented, and utilized the biological glue to seal the anastomosis. The contralateral vas of each animal underwent vasectomy and reapproximation of unligated ends so that the rate of spontaneous recanalization could be accessed. Rats were sacrificed at 24 hours, one week, four weeks, and three months postvasovasostomy. The vasal specimens were evaluated for gross patency, presence and size of sperm granuloma, mean flow rates at varying infusion pressures, tensile strength measurements and histologic studies. Combining the one and three month groups, a similar patency rate was obtained by either technique; 83% (n = 18) for the sutured group, and 90% (n = 21) for the fibrin glue group. The rate of spontaneous recanalization of the contralateral vasa in the one and three month animals was 8% (n = 38). The mean flow rates obtained at high and low infusion pressures were not statistically different for the two techniques. The tensile strength of the glue anastomosis averaged 78% of the tensile strength achieved by the conventional sutured technique. The incidence of sperm granuloma after vasovasostomy was 28% for the fibrin glue group and 61% for the sutured group. Additionally, 67% of granulomas were small (less than 3 mm.) in the glue group, compared to only 36% in the sutured group. Histology revealed similar morphological changes in the area of anastomosis with either technique. Operative time for sutured vasovasostomy averaged 24 minutes, compared to an average of 11 minutes for the glue assisted vasovasostomy. The use of fibrin glue allowed the performance of a sperm tight patent anastomosis that had the advantages of reduced incidence of sperm granuloma formation, reduced operative time, and less microsurgical skill required to perform the anastomosis. 
Long-lasting depression of the factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic system in patients with myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator: a randomized placebo-controlled study. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, seven patients with acute myocardial infarction allocated to intravenous treatment with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and seven patients allocated to placebo were studied during eight sampling periods before and after treatment. Seven patients with acute myocardial infarction treated intravenously with 1.5 million U of streptokinase were later studied during two sampling periods before and after treatment. The placebo group showed no significant deviations of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity (p greater than 0.05). In the rt-PA group, this activity decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) after the infusion and remained depressed throughout the 1st 4 days. A significant decrease in activity (p less than 0.05) was also found in the streptokinase-treated patients. The depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity was not due to generation of inhibition or a depletion of factor XII, prekallikrein and plasminogen, but could be related to the proactivator of this system. It is concluded that rt-PA (and streptokinase) treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction causes a prolonged depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity. This depression of endogenous fibrinolytic activity needs to be evaluated in relation to the enhanced risk of coronary reocclusion after thrombolytic therapy. 
Correlation of histology and drug response of human tumors grown in native-state three-dimensional histoculture and in nude mice. An in vitro histoculture system in which a native-state collagen-sponge gel supports the three-dimensional growth of tumor tissue has been recently developed that allows the culture and drug response assay for most every tumor type. Important features of the histoculture system include the maintenance of three-dimensional tissue architecture and the use of histological autoradiography to measure nuclear incorporation of [3H]thymidine as an endpoint. We describe in this report in vitro-in vivo correlations for drug response and tumor histology by using human tumor xenografts grown in the native-state three-dimensional histoculture system and as xenografts in nude mice. This comparison eliminates many of the confounding variables seen in most correlative clinical trials. Results demonstrate (i) a very high preservation of in vivo tissue architecture in vitro, (ii) an 86% accuracy in vitro of predicting drug resistance in vivo using suprapharmacologic doses of drugs in vitro, and (iii) an overall predictive frequency of drug resistance and sensitivity ranging from 53% for 5-fluorouracil to 78% for doxorubicin. 
Combination balloon-ultrasound imaging catheter for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Validation of imaging, analysis of recoil, and identification of plaque fracture. BACKGROUND. We investigated the hypothesis that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon could be used to perform quantitative assessment of arterial dimensions before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and to identify certain mechanical alterations consequent to PTA, including vascular wall recoil and the initiation of plaque fractures. METHODS AND RESULTS. A combination balloon-ultrasound imaging catheter (BUIC) that houses a 20-MHz ultrasound transducer within and halfway between the proximal and distal ends of an angioplasty balloon was used to perform PTA in 10 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Each PTA site was also evaluated before and after PTA by standard (nonballoon) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) technique. In eight patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC before PTA, luminal cross-sectional area (XSA) of stenotic sites (0.10 +/- 0.01 cm2) did not differ significantly from measurements of XSA by IVUS (0.09 +/- 0.01 cm2, p = NS). Likewise, minimum luminal diameter (Dmin) measured by BUIC (0.34 +/- 0.02 cm) was similar to that measured by IVUS (0.33 +/- 0.01 cm, p = NS). In nine patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC after PTA, XSA measured by BUIC (0.29 +/- 0.03 cm2) did not differ significantly from XSA measured by IVUS (0.30 +/- 0.03 cm2, p = NS). Dmin measured by BUIC after PTA (0.57 +/- 0.02 cm) was also similar to Dmin measured by IVUS (0.57 +/- 0.03 cm, p = NS). After PTA, XSA and Dmin measured immediately after deflation were significantly less than balloon XSA and diameter at full inflation, indicating significant elastic recoil of the dilated site. For the nine patients in whom post-PTA images were satisfactory for quantitative analysis, including four patients in whom recoil was 39%, 46%, 50%, and 61%, percent recoil measured 28.6 +/- 7.2%. Finally, plaque fractures were identified on-line in six of 10 patients (60%); in each case, initiation of plaque fracture was observed at inflation pressures of 2 atm or less. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this preliminary human investigation indicate that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon can be used to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of lumen-plaque-wall alterations immediately preceding, during, and immediately after PTA in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 
Effects of rapid volume expansion on the right filling pressures after prosthetic valve surgery. The effects of rapid intravascular volume expansion were studied in 12 patients, 4 to 14 years after single prosthetic heart valve replacement. The data observed showed a statistically significant mean difference before and after volume expansion of right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end diastolic and pulmonary capillary pressures. However, right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures equilibration was not detected. The right atrial pressure form showed abnormal variations during inspiration. Dip and plateau right ventricular diastolic pressure configuration was recorded in 6 patients after expansion, was absent in 2 and questionable in 4. A deep Y descent with an M-shaped right atrial pressure form was recorded in all 12 patients. The explanation for these phenomena is unclear. Thus, in the absence of pressure equilibration and clinical evidence of constriction, the abnormalities recorded during rapid volume expansion should be cautiously interpreted. 
Reproducibility of left ventricular myocardial volume and mass measurements by ultrafast computed tomography. Ultrafast computed tomography has been reported to be an accurate method of measuring left ventricular mass in dogs. To assess the interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability of left ventricular myocardial mass measurements in humans, left ventricular myocardial volume was measured three times within 24 h in 16 patients with ischemic heart disease. The mean percent difference of the mean of the three studies performed was -0.01 +/- 1.4% (range -2.9% to 3.6%). The regression analysis for the intraobserver variability at baseline was: Y = -4.33 + 1.03X; r = 0.99, SEE = 3.5 ml. The mean percent difference of the mean of the two sets of measurements performed by two independent observers was 0.28 +/- 2.1% (range -4.35% to 4.35%). The interobserver variability excluding papillary muscles at baseline study was: Y = -4.34 + 1.06X; r = 0.99, SEE = 1.5 ml. The regression analysis with versus without papillary muscles showed: Y = -8.72 + 0.97X; r = 0.96, SEE = 2.6 ml. Regression analysis to assess the variability of 24-h studies at end-systole versus end-diastole revealed: Y = 3.07 + 0.94X; r = 0.97, SEE = 1.8 ml. In conclusion, ultrafast computed tomography is a minimally invasive technique, with very low interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability for left ventricular myocardial volume and mass determinations in serial studies. 
Cisplatin and novobiocin in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. A Southwest Oncology Group study. Novobiocin, a commercially available oral antibiotic, inhibits DNA topoisomerase II in a manner shown in cell culture to enhance the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents and cisplatin. Thirty-six patients were entered on a Phase II trial using high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 for four cycles) after steady-state dosing with novobiocin (1000 mg or four 250-mg capsules every 12 hours for six doses, four of which were administered before each dose of cisplatin). One patient remains on study and cannot be evaluated for response. No complete responses were seen. Three patients (8%) had partial responses and an additional patient had an unconfirmed partial response. The median survival time of all patients was just less than 7 months. These results are comparable with those of other concurrent Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Phase II and III trials of high-dose cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Novobiocin plasma levels were obtained for three patients and were approximately 50% of the optimal concentration as reported in cell culture for potentiation of cytotoxicity. It was concluded that an optimum test of novobiocin as a modulator of cytotoxicity may require the availability of an intravenous preparation. 
Perioperative morbidity and mortality of gynecologic brachytherapy. The incidence and nature of perioperative complications associated with gynecologic brachytherapy applications were determined in 462 implants performed on 327 patients with cervical, endometrial, or vaginal cancer from 1986 to 1988. Twenty-one patients (6.4%) had life-threatening complications, including cardiac (16 patients), thromboembolic (4 patients), and pulmonary (1 patient) events. Three complications (0.9%) were fatal within the first 30 days, and two patients died of delayed sequelae of perioperative complications; thus, there was an overall 1.5% mortality rate. Patients experiencing life-threatening complications tended to be older (P = 0.0002), and to have a history of cardiac disease (P = 0.0002) and an increased American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (P = 0.003). Logistic analysis demonstrated that a history of cardiac disease and increased age were independent predictors of life-threatening complications (P = 0.01). Careful patient selection and intensive perioperative care of the high-risk patient may prove to substantially diminish these complications. 
Diagnostic imaging of heterotopic ossification with coexistent deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia. Heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis can coexist. This raises potential problems because diagnosis depends heavily on imaging studies, and an ideal imaging study which will cost-effectively and noninvasively diagnose both conditions simultaneously is not readily available. A case of coexistent heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia is presented. In this case, deep-venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus were diagnosed and treatment was begun without knowledge of the coexistent heterotopic ossification. Alternative imaging and laboratory diagnostic strategies are discussed. It was concluded that, at this time, clinical acumen and judicious use of traditional diagnostic alternatives is the best means of selecting appropriate treatment. Awareness of the coexistence of the two conditions are careful attention to the patient's clinical course can minimize treatment delays and resultant morbidity. 
Evaluation of the patient with stable angina following coronary artery bypass surgery. Bypass graft stenosis and occlusion are relatively common events, occurring eventually in the majority of patients who survive beyond 5 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These processes, in combination with progressive native coronary artery disease, lead to recurrent angina and an increased need for medication in most patients late after surgery. Patients with unstable ischemic symptoms generally should proceed directly to coronary arteriography, whereas patients with stable angina may be candidates for noninvasive testing to evaluate their risk and the extent of myocardial jeopardy. If the initial revascularization procedure is successful, preoperative thallium 201 imaging abnormalities should be reversed. Persistent abnormalities beyond 6 months after revascularization indicate incomplete revascularization or perioperative infarction. Defects noted in the immediate postoperative period may be areas of myocardial stunning or hibernation, which can require up to 6 months to reverse. If chest pain recurs after revascularization, a normal thallium 201 perfusion pattern indicates that the symptom is probably not ischemic in nature. Thallium 201 perfusion abnormalities may precede symptoms by several months and may be the only indication of significant myocardial ischemia in patients with silent ischemia. Advanced tomographic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), should theoretically improve disease detection and localization following revascularization. Practically speaking, only the left anterior descending coronary bed is well evaluated by these tomographic imaging techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT imaging for evaluation of posterior circulation abnormalities remains unacceptably low. Complexities of competitive flow and collateralization that may exist in the postoperative period make it difficult to relate perfusion abnormalities to a specific graft stenosis. However, tomographic perfusion imaging may provide useful correlative information on the functional impact of bypass graft stenoses in patients with recurrent angina who have undergone coronary angiography and in whom the angiographic indications for repeat surgery or angioplasty are not compelling. Newer tomographic and metabolic imaging techniques such as CT, NMRI, and PET remain unproven as diagnostic tests for the evaluation of unselected patient populations presenting with recurrent angina following revascularization surgery. 
Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: an immunohistochemical study. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the anterior pituitary gland. In some cases, there is evidence of concurrent autoimmune disease. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed visual disturbance during the early postpartum period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension. Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland. We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity. 
Changes in alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor density in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Catecholamines are involved critically in the mechanisms of liver cell proliferation by acting on hepatic alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors. To identify the role of these receptors in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the density was examined of alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors with their affinity and coupling of beta-2 adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase in HCC tissue and in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from the same livers. Studies were also done on healthy livers from age-matched and sex-matched patients undergoing abdominal surgery for nonhepatic diseases. Twenty-two HCC had a decrease of about 72% in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and a decrease of about 40% compared with healthy controls. Nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC patients had a 125% increase in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with healthy livers. Twenty-three of 24 HCC had an increase of about 180% in beta adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. Beta adrenoceptors were coupled to adenylate cyclase, as evidenced by a guanosine triphosphate-mediated right shift in (-)-isoproterenol competition isotherms and by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production after stimulation with (-)-isoproterenol. The HCC tissue yielded a larger increase in cAMP than nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. The authors conclude that a higher density of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC characterizes the "healthy" part of the liver in HCC patients and that an increase in beta-2 and a decrease in alpha-1 adrenoceptor densities characterize the tumor part of the liver in human HCC. 
High-affinity androgen binding and androgenic regulation of alpha 1(I)-procollagen and transforming growth factor-beta steady state messenger ribonucleic acid levels in human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. Clinical observations have demonstrated a positive effect of estrogens and androgens on the maintenance of structural bone integrity. This study examines the direct effects of androgenic hormones on the osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line, HOS TE85. Employing radiolabeled dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 2800 saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant = 0.66 nM) androgen binding sites were detected per HOS TE85 cell. Androgen binding was specific in that DHT and testosterone (T) displayed significantly greater competition than the progestins, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone. The expression of androgen receptors in HOS TE85 cells was further substantiated by Northern analysis. A human androgen receptor complementary DNA probe revealed a 9.5 kilobase transcript which corresponds to the predominant human androgen receptor transcript detected in human male reproductive tissues. Androgens were also found to elicit biological responses in HOS TE85 cells. Physiological concentrations of DHT and T decreased HOS TE85 cell proliferation as assessed by cell count. This finding suggests that DHT may also play a role in osteoblast differentiation. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with T (24 h, 10 nM) enhanced the abundance of both alpha 1(I)-procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) (5-fold) and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA (2.2 fold). The nonaromatizable androgen DHT (24 h, 10 nM) elicited an increase in the steady state concentration of alpha 1(I)-procollagen mRNA similar to the increase observed with T treatment. Thus, in addition to the recent discovery of estradiol receptors and estrogenic regulation of HOS TE85 cells, it is now evident that these osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells also express high affinity androgen binding sites and can respond biologically to androgens. 
Membranous lipodystrophy: MR imaging appearance of the brain. Five patients with membranous lipodystrophy (lipomembranous polycystic osteodysplasia with progressive dementia) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain. T2-weighted MR images showed atrophied cerebral white matter with dilated ventricles; increased signal intensity of the white matter; and decreased signal intensity of the thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebral cortex. Although each single finding is not specific, the combination of the above MR findings when coupled with skeletal lesions strongly suggests this rare disease. 
Cavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Failure of ciprofloxacin to eradicate convalescent fecal excretion after acute salmonellosis: experience during an outbreak in health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy in eradicating convalescent fecal excretion of salmonellae after acute salmonellosis. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of ciprofloxacin, with prospective follow-up of nonparticipants. SETTING: An acute care community hospital experiencing an outbreak of salmonellosis. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight health care workers developed acute infection with Salmonella java; 15 participated in a placebo-controlled trial of ciprofloxacin, beginning on day 9 after infection. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, and 7 patients to receive placebo; both were administered orally twice daily for 14 days. Nonparticipants who received therapy were placed on the same ciprofloxacin regimen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study participants had follow-up stool cultures every 3 days initially and then weekly for 3 weeks; nonparticipants were followed until three consecutive cultures were negative. All eight ciprofloxacin recipients showed eradication of S. java from stool cultures within 7 days of beginning therapy (compared with 1 of 7 placebo recipients), and their stool cultures remained negative up to 14 days after discontinuing therapy (P less than 0.01). However, 4 of 8 relapsed; their stool cultures became positive between 14 and 21 days after therapy. In addition, 3 of 3 hospitalized patients treated with ciprofloxacin who did not participate in the controlled trial also relapsed. Thus, the total relapse rate was 7 of 11 (64%; 95% CI, 31% to 89%). In 4 of these 7 patients, relapse was associated with a longer duration of fecal excretion of salmonellae than that of the placebo group. Relapse could not be explained on the basis of noncompliance, development of resistance, or presence of biliary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its excellent antimicrobial activity against salmonellae and its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 750 mg orally twice daily had an unacceptably high failure rate in patients with acute salmonellosis and may have prolonged fecal excretion of salmonellae. The late occurrence of relapses indicates the need to obtain stool cultures up to 21 days after therapy to document fecal eradication in acute salmonellosis. 
Insulin secretory response to secretagogues by perifused islets from chronically glucose-infused rats. Perifused islets from rats infused for 7 days with 40% glucose exhibited an altered secretory response to selected stimuli. Both phases of insulin release were blunted when 20 mM L-leucine was tested; the secretory response to a subsequent leucine stimulation was also blunted compared with the control group. The ability of 20 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate to stimulate the release of insulin was also greatly diminished in islets from glucose-infused rats. The secretory response to 50 microM tolbutamide plus 7 mM glucose by perifused islets from glucose-infused rats was 45% lower than in the control group. In addition, the response to a subsequent 10 mM glucose stimulation was lost. On the other hand, islets from glucose-infused rats responded to 20 microM forskolin plus 16.7 mM glucose with on significant change in the amount of insulin released during both phases of stimulation compared with the control group. The response to 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was 3.1-fold higher in islets from glucose-infused compared with saline-infused rats. The finding that chronic infusions of glucose lead to selective impairment of the secretory response to fuel stimuli and agents such as tolbutamide that act on metabolically regulated K+ channels gives support to the notion that alterations in the generation of metabolic coupling signals might be involved in the phenomenon described here. 
Obstructive dilatation of extrahepatic recipient and donor bile ducts complicating orthotopic liver transplantation: imaging and laboratory findings. Biliary obstruction in liver transplants is most commonly due to stricture at the biliary anastomosis. The native common bile duct typically is normal. We retrospectively studied 28 patients with choledochocholedochostomy anastomoses who had marked native and donor extrahepatic bile duct dilatation associated with clinical evidence of biliary obstruction. Operative cholangiograms were compared with postoperative cholangiograms obtained a mean of 50 weeks (range, 2-246 weeks) later. Mean caliber of the native common bile duct increased from 7.5 +/- 2.0 mm on operative cholangiograms to 14.8 +/- 3.9 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Mean caliber of the donor common hepatic duct increased from 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm on operative cholangiograms to 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Dilatation of the cystic duct remnant was seen in 15 patients. All patients had surgical revision to choledochojejunostomy with improved results of liver function studies in most cases. Diffuse dilatation of native and donor extrahepatic bile ducts may develop in liver transplant recipients. Typical features include native and donor extrahepatic ducts greater than 12 mm in diameter and a dilated cystic duct remnant on postoperative cholangiography in a patient with otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction. 
Patency rate of endoscopic middle meatus antrostomy. A series of 145 patients with chronic sinusitis were treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Patency of the middle meatus was evaluated by actuarial life-table methods. After 24 months' follow-up, the overall patency rate of endoscopic middle meatotomy was 94.08%. Questionnaire data indicated that 91.8% of these patients were improved or asymptomatic. This preliminary study indicates that the patency rate of middle meatal antrostomy appears to be greater than that of inferior meatal antrostomy when compared to literature controls, and that a high percentage of these patients are improved by this surgery. 
Intracellular pH in human resistance arteries in essential hypertension. To investigate intracellular pH (pHi) in human resistance arteries in essential hypertension, vessels were obtained from small biopsies of skin and subcutaneous fat from 14 untreated patients, and the results were compared with those from 14 matched normotensive control volunteers. Segments of isolated resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Fluorescence signals were monitored using a series of barrier filters and chromatic beam splitters. In this way both resting pHi and the changes in pHi observed during isometric contractions initiated by agonists could be recorded. Resting pHi was not different in vessels from hypertensive patients (hypertensive, 7.24 +/- 0.06 versus control, 7.25 +/- 0.04 pH units). The application of ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) demonstrated that both Na(+)-H+ exchange and bicarbonate-dependent membrane mechanisms contributed to pHi homeostasis but that neither system was overactive in hypertension (pHi change with EIPA in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.13 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively, and pHi change with DIDS in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.097 +/- 0.05 and -0.091 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively). The application of norepinephrine or 125 mM K+ solution induced contraction in the arterial segments with an accompanying fall in pHi. With norepinephrine this fall was significantly attenuated in vessels from hypertensive patients. These results fail to provide evidence for raised pHi in resistance arteries in human essential hypertension, and contrary to previous reports in circulating blood cells, Na(+)-H+ exchange is not overactive in the vessels of such patients. 
Cerebrovascular abnormalities in pediatric stroke: assessment using parenchymal and angiographic magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive technique that images the intracranial and cervical arterial vasculature without contrast agents. Twenty-four children with strokes had combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography 1 day to 4 years after acute presentation. Eight had had prior intra-arterial angiography. Eighteen magnetic resonance angiographic studies showed arterial stenosis or occlusion in the vascular distribution of magnetic resonance image-defined brain infarction and, in 7 children, in the same location as previously defined abnormalities on intra-arterial angiography. One child had a normal intra-arterial angiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram. The other 5 children with normal magnetic resonance angiographic studies included 3 with presumed embolic disease, 1 with meningitis, and 1 with Crohn's disease-related vasculitis. Collateral flow patterns could be determined in 4 children. Artifact presenting as filling defects in vessels was present in 10 studies, but did not interfere with interpretation of 8 studies. Combined magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography provides a screening technique to evaluate noninvasively brain parenchyma and vasculature in children with suspected large-vessel abnormalities, allowing selection for intra-arterial angiography and serial monitoring of vascular abnormalities over time and during therapeutic intervention. 
Scintigraphic measurement of regional gut transit in idiopathic constipation. In this study, total gut transit and regional colonic transit in patients with idiopathic constipation were measured scintigraphically. Eight patients with severe constipation were studied, none of whom had evidence of abnormal function of the pelvic floor. 99mTc-radiolabeled Amberlite resin particles (average diameter, 1 mm; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) with a mixed meal were used to assess gastric emptying and small bowel transit; similar particles labeled with 111In were ingested in a coated capsule that dispersed in the ileocecal region. These were used to quantify colonic transit. Five healthy volunteers were also studied. Two patients showed delayed gastric emptying and two had slow small bowel transit. Seven of the eight patients had slow colonic transit. In five, delay affected the whole colon ("pancolonic inertia"); in two, transit in the ascending and transverse colon was normal, but solids moved through the left colon slowly. Mean colonic transit was also measured using radiopaque markers; this technique identified the patients with slow transit, as shown by measurements of overall colonic transit by simultaneous scintigraphy. However, estimated transit through the ascending and transverse colons was considerably shorter by the radiopaque marker technique. In conclusion, idiopathic constipation is characterized by either exaggerated reservoir functions of the ascending and transverse colons and/or impairment of propulsive function in the descending colon. Particle size may influence the result of regional colonic transit tests. Transit delays in other parts of the gut suggest that, in some patients, the condition may be a more generalized motor dysfunction. 
Pain causes in 200 patients referred to a multidisciplinary cancer pain clinic. Causes of pain were analysed in 200 patients referred to a specialized cancer pain clinic. Pain caused by tumour growth was found in 158 patients, pain secondary to cancer or its treatment in 116 patients and pain unrelated to cancer in 33 patients. Visceral involvement (74 cases), bone metastases (68 cases), soft tissue invasion (56 cases) and nerve/plexus pressure or infiltration (39 cases) were the most frequent causes of pain due to tumour growth. Myogenic pain (68 cases) was the most frequent cause of secondary pain. The patients presented with a multitude of different combinations of causes of pain, the majority having at least two separate causes. Since pain treatment in cancer patients should be determined by its aetiology, a detailed analysis of the pain condition in each patient should form the basis for a rational therapy. 
The effects of induced mood on laboratory pain. Sixty-five subjects experienced 2 cold pressor immersions. Following the initial immersion, subjects participated in the Velten mood induction procedure by reading either depressive, neutral or elative statements. The sensory discriminative response to pain was measured by ratings of pain, and the affective-reactive response to pain was measured by pain tolerance. Pain tolerance, but not pain ratings, were affected by mood inductions with subjects in the depression condition shortening their tolerance times more than the subjects in the neutral condition and the subjects in the elative condition increasing their tolerance times. 
Anatomic location and variety of nonmalignant neck masses seen in surgical practice. During a 10-year interval, 189 patients, comprised of 121 females and 68 males ranging in age from 1 to 98 years, were surgically treated for nonmalignant neck masses. Nonmalignant neck masses were located in the thyroid or submaxillary gland in 60 per cent of these patients. Thyroid adenoma, reactive cervical nodes, and mixed tumor of the submaxillary salivary glands represented the three most commonly occurring nonmalignant pathologic conditions in this series. When stratified by age and sex, thyroid abnormalities, specifically thyroid adenoma, occurred most often in females of all ages. In males, reactive nodes were usually seen before 40 years of age; thereafter, tumors of the submaxillary salivary gland predominated. Most studies of nonmalignant neck masses indicate that reactive nodes are the most common condition in patients of all ages. Thyroid conditions were seen most frequently in this group of patients. The probable explanation is a tertiary referral pattern to surgeons. Patients with nonsurgical conditions were, presumably, identified and managed earlier and not referred further, and therefore did not appear in this group of patients. 
Induction chemotherapy plus radiation compared with surgery plus radiation in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group. BACKGROUND. We performed a prospective, randomized study in patients with previously untreated advanced (Stage III or IV) laryngeal squamous carcinoma to compare the results of induction chemotherapy followed by definitive radiation therapy with those of conventional laryngectomy and postoperative radiation. METHODS. Three hundred thirty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy or surgery and radiation therapy. The clinical tumor response was assessed after two cycles of chemotherapy, and patients with a response received a third cycle followed by definitive radiation therapy (6600 to 7600 cGy). Patients in whom ther was no tumor response or who had locally recurrent cancers after chemotherapy and radiation therapy underwent salvage laryngectomy. RESULTS. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the clinical tumor response was complete in 31 percent of the patients and partial in 54 percent. After a median follow-up of 33 months, the estimated 2-year survival was 68 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 60 to 76 percent) for both treatment groups (P = 0.9846). Patterns of recurrence differed significantly between the two groups, with more local recurrences (P = 0.0005) and fewer distant metastases (P = 0.016) in the chemotherapy group than in the surgery group. A total of 59 patients in the chemotherapy group (36 percent) required total laryngectomy. The larynx was preserved in 64 percent of the patients overall and 64 percent of the patients who were alive and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS. These preliminary results suggest a new role for chemotherapy in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer and indicate that a treatment strategy involving induction chemotherapy and definitive radiation therapy can be effective in preserving the larynx in a high percentage of patients, without compromising overall survival. 
Cardiac manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome: a 1991 update. Cardiac involvement is being identified more often clinically and at autopsy in patients with AIDS. Recent estimates suggest that in the United States as many as 5000 patients per year may have cardiac complications resulting from HIV infection. Patients with AIDS may have pericardial, myocardial, and/or endocardial disease. Pericardial tamponade and/or constriction may be related to neoplasms, infections, or nonspecific effusions. Myocardial dysfunction may result from specific neoplastic infiltration or myocarditis. Particularly intriguing is the role of HIV-1 in the nonspecific myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in patients with AIDS. As in other debilitating conditions patients with AIDS can have nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Infective endocarditis may be a complication, especially in AIDS associated with intravenous drug abuse. Most patients with AIDS have no overt clinical evidence of cardiac disease. When cardiac dysfunction does develop, the signs and symptoms are often misinterpreted to be the result of noncardiac causes (pulmonary failure or infection) which can mimic heart failure. This review is intended to alert the reader to the cardiac manifestations of AIDS, which present a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. 
Expression of neu protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transforming growth factor alpha in breast cancer. Correlation with clinicopathologic parameters. The major objectives of this study were twofold: to determine 1) if growth factors or growth factor receptors were expressed similarly or differently in a clinically well-characterized group of breast cancer patients and 2) if these phenotypic characteristics were associated with any of the commonly used prognostic parameters. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 51 node-positive breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of neu, epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) using immunoperoxidase staining. Positive membranous staining for neu was observed in 15 (29%) tumors. Over-expression of neu was observed in high-grade, estrogen-receptor-negative tumors (P less than 0.05). Epidermal growth factor receptor was expressed in 22 (43%) of the tumors analyzed and found to a greater degree in estrogen-receptor-negative and high-grade tumors (P less than 0.025). A significant correlation between neu and EGF-R expression was also noted. Tumors expressing membranous staining of neu had a greater than 70% chance of expressing EGF-R (P less than 0.01). Expression of TGF alpha was found in 68% of tumors and TGF alpha was detected in grade 1 and 2 tumor to a greater degree than EGF-R. The authors conclude that assaying tumors for these antigens may give additional phenotypic characteristics that can give further insight into the biology of breast cancer. 
Treatment of superior vena cava thrombosis with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Thrombotic occlusion of the superior vena cava is an uncommon but serious complication of chronic indwelling venous catheters. Several reports have shown thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase or urokinase to be effective in the treatment of this condition. We report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis in a 53-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy for breast carcinoma through a subcutaneously implanted venous access catheter who was successfully treated with peripheral infusion of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA). 
Composition of fat in enteral diets can influence outcome in experimental peritonitis. An animal model of protracted acute peritonitis was used to study the effects on survival of different amounts and types of dietary fat. Guinea pigs (n = 132) were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then placed, allowing for effusion of viable bacteria during the next week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3.5%, 14%, or 56% of total calories) and fat composition (100% Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100% MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35% omega-three fatty acids], or a 50:50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared. Among all types of fat used, the level of fat did not affect outcome, with survival rates of 13% (6 of 45) at the low level of fat used, 30% (13 of 44) at the medium level, and 26% (11 of 43) at the high level (P greater than 0.10). However fat composition significantly influenced survival across all levels of fat, with a 39% (17 of 44) survival rate in the groups given equal amounts of Microlipid and MaxEPA, compared either to 21% (9 of 44) for the 100% Microlipid groups, or to 9% (4 of 44) for the 100% MaxEPA groups (p less than 0.05). A second experiment was performed with 58 animals fed five different mixtures of fats, all at 14% of total calories. Diets were made with fat ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 Microlipid to MaxEPA. The survival rate in the 50:50 group was 83% (10 of 12), which is significantly higher than the survival rates with any of the others (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the amount of fat in the diet does not strongly influence outcome in this model. However an equal mixture of safflower and fish oils significantly improves survival rates compared to diets made with single-oil preparations. 
Multi-infarct dementia, subcortical dementia, and hydrocephalus. The diagnostic evaluation of dementia is directed toward the identification of treatable causes. It can be facilitated by classification of the dementia into one of four categories: attentional, amnestic, cognitive, and intentional. Intentional dementia reflects dysfunction of frontal lobe systems, components of which include the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, limbic structures, and subcortical white matter. Disorders that affect one or more of these components and produce intentional dementia include Binswanger's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, HIV infection, closed head injury, normal pressure hydrocephalus, neoplasms, syphilis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and a number of uncommon degenerative and acquired syndromes. Depression may resemble intentional dementia. Guidelines for diagnosis and management are discussed. 
Achlorhydria-induced hypergastrinaemia: the role of bacteria. 1. Studies of Helicobacter pylori show that microbes can alter gastrin release. Lack of gastric acid (achlorhydria) causes hypergastrinaemia and allows bacteria to grow within the stomach. We speculated that the bacteria contribute to the rise in gastrin seen after acid inhibition, and tested the idea by comparing plasma gastrin levels during inhibition of acid secretion between germ-free and conventional rats. 2. Matched germ-free and conventional rats (n = 8 per group) received either vehicle (saline) or one of two doses of the histamine-H2-receptor antagonist loxtidine for 1 week. Gastrin was measured in cardiac blood by a specific r.i.a. 3. Plasma gastrin concentrations in germ-free and conventional rats were 59 +/- 11 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) and 36 +/- 8 pmol/l, respectively, after vehicle, and 153 +/- 30 pmol/l and 181 +/- 27 pmol/l, respectively, after loxtidine at a dose of 10 mg day -1 kg -1, which partially inhibits acid secretion. Administration of loxtidine at a dose of 70 mg day -1 kg-1, which completely inhibits acid secretion, did not produce a significant extra rise in plasma gastrin concentration in germ-free rats (178 +/- 11 pmol/l), but further elevated plasma gastrin concentrations to 278 +/- 26 pmol/l in conventional rats (P less than 0.005 compared with germ-free rats). 4. Loxtidine produced a dose-dependent rise in the number of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa of conventional rats. 5. We conclude that partial inhibition of gastric acid secretion increases gastrin release independently of bacteria, but that bacteria are involved in the further rise in gastrin which occurs on more profound inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
Functional complementation of ataxia-telangiectasia group D (AT-D) cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and mapping of the AT-D locus to the region 11q22-23. The hereditary human disease ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by phenotypic complexity at the cellular level. We show that multiple mutant phenotypes of immortalized AT cells from genetic complementation group D (AT-D) are corrected after the introduction of a single human chromosome from a human-mouse hybrid line by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. This chromosome is cytogenetically abnormal. It consists primarily of human chromosome 18, but it carries translocated material from the region 11q22-23, where one or more AT genes have been previously mapped by linkage analysis. A cytogenetically normal human chromosome 18 does not complement AT-D cells after microcell-mediated transfer, whereas a normal human chromosome 11 does. We conclude that the AT-D gene is located on chromosome 11q22-23. 
Reversal of alcohol dependence and tolerance by a single administration of flumazenil. Chronic exposure to ethanol is associated with the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol and a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anxiety and seizure susceptibility. In the present study we examined the ability of flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse neuronal and behavioral manifestations of ethanol tolerance and dependence. A single injection of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, 14 hr before withdrawal) to mice administered a liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days, reduced seizure severity during withdrawal from ethanol. Acute tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was not sensitive to flumazenil treatment, but tolerance and diazepam-induced cross-tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol were reversed by a single injection of flumazenil given 2 to 26 hr before evaluation of tolerance. At a biochemical level, the ability of benzodiazepine inverse agonists (e.g., Ro15-4513) to reduce the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channels may represent a neuronal manifestation of ethanol dependence (Buck and Harris, 1990). Flumazenil treatment of ethanol-dependent mice 14 hr before isolation of brain membrane vesicles partially reversed the augmentation of Ro15-4513 inhibition of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro. These results demonstrate that brief occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by an antagonist may reset the cellular mechanisms responsible for the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence, and support the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonists is involved in the development of ethanol dependence. 
Acne fulminans with hepatosplenomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans. Acne fulminans is a rare form of acne characterized by ulcerative nodules and associated with systemic complications. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with cystic acne who experienced sudden onset of acne fulminans associated with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and erythema nodosum migrans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acne fulminans manifested by hepatomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans. 
Classic and vigorous achalasia: a comparison of manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings. Compared with classic achalasia, vigorous achalasia has been defined as achalasia with relatively high esophageal contraction amplitudes, often with minimal esophageal dilation and prominent tertiary contractions on radiographs, and with the presence of chest pain. However, no study using current manometric techniques has compared manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings in vigorous and classic achalasia or questioned the usefulness of making this distinction. Fifty-four cases involving patients with achalasia whose radiographic and manometric studies were performed within 6 months of each other were available for review. Patients with vigorous achalasia (n = 17), defined by amplitude greater than or equal to 37 mm Hg, and patients with classic achalasia (n = 37), defined as amplitude less than 37 mm Hg, had substantial overlap in radiographic parameters of esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and tertiary contractions. Manometric properties of repetitive waves and lower esophageal sphincter pressure and clinical aspects of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, and satisfactory responses to pneumatic dilation were similar in both forms of achalasia. A separate analysis of patients with mean contraction amplitude greater than 60 mm Hg revealed similar findings. It is concluded that use of amplitude as a criterion for classifying achalasia is arbitrary and of dubious value. 
Stroke rehabilitation: a model predicting return home. We undertook this study to describe the changes in functional status for patients in a rehabilitation program for acute stroke and to identify the variables that best predict discharge home. Of 282 patients, 75% were discharged home. Increases in functional status were found for all 18 activities of the Functional Independence Measure from admission to discharge. Significant predictors of discharge disposition in a logistic regression model were the admission and discharge functional status scores, length of stay, and living arrangement before the stroke. The functional status at discharge was the most important predictor. Knowledge of these predictors can contribute to more appropriate treatment and discharge planning. 
Basaloid squamous carcinoma of the hypopharynx and larynx associated with second primary tumors. Basaloid squamous carcinoma is believed to be a histologically distinct variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck region with 11 cases reported. Two cases arising in the pyriform fossa and vallecula are reported, both of which were associated with second primary malignant tumors: esophageal small cell carcinoma and palatal squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. The authors suggest that basaloid squamous carcinoma may be associated with a high incidence of second primary tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract or larynx. 
Sodium-lithium countertransport and cardiorenal abnormalities in essential hypertension. The rate of red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport is elevated only in a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension. We have therefore compared renal and cardiac function and morphology in two groups of hypertensive patients with high (n = 23) or normal (n = 22) sodium-lithium countertransport (mean +/- SEM: 0.61 +/- 0.10 versus 0.29 +/- 0.07 mmol/l red blood cells.hr). The two groups were similar in age, sex distribution, body mass index, smoking habit, duration of hypertension, and actual levels of untreated blood pressure. Hypertensive patients with elevated sodium-lithium countertransport activity showed elevated glomerular filtration rate (118 +/- 2 versus 109 +/- 2 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.001), albumin excretion rate (23 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 micrograms/min; p less than 0.001), larger kidney volume (250 +/- 15 versus 203 +/- 13 ml.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), lower lithium clearance rate (26.7 +/- 0.3 versus 28.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), and higher total body exchangeable sodium (2,716 +/- 33 versus 2,485 +/- 41 mmol.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass index (139 +/- 6 versus 119 +/- 6 g/m2; p less than 0.05), relative wall thickness (0.39 +/- 0.05 versus 0.29 +/- 0.04 cm; p less than 0.001), and left posterior wall plus intraventricular septum thickness (2.02 +/- 0.04 versus 1.76 +/- 0.03 cm; p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with high sodium-lithium countertransport. Hypertensive patients with normal sodium-lithium countertransport had renal and cardiac parameters similar to those of a normotensive control group (n = 21) except for a higher glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular mass index. 
Painful tic convulsif caused by a contralateral vertebral artery. The case of trigeminal neuralgia and ipsilateral hemifacial spasm--painful tic convulsif--is presented. Microsurgical exploration revealed compression of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves by a tortuous contralateral vertebral artery. Neurovascular decompression of the roots entry/exit zone completely relieved preoperative facial pain and spasm. 
Glaucoma filtration surgery: new horizontal mattress closure of conjunctival incision. We developed a conjunctival wound closure technique with the idea of decreasing the incidence of wound leak following glaucoma filtration surgery. A micropoint 9-0 nylon vascular needle is used as a running mattress suture to close the limbal conjunctiva in routine fornix-based flap trabeculectomy surgery, trabeculectomy surgery with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and combined cataract and trabeculectomy surgery. In a series of 52 eyes in 52 patients in which we used this technique, there have been no cases of flat anterior chamber or significant choroidal effusion, complications often occurring secondary to trabeculectomy which require further intervention. 
Oxygen-dependent lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia. The effect of alveolar oxygen tension on lung lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia was evaluated by using isolated rat lungs perfused with synthetic medium. After a 5-min equilibration period, global ischemia was produced by discontinuing perfusion while ventilation continued with gas mixtures containing 5% CO2 and a fixed oxygen concentration between 0 and 95%. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of tissue thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and conjugated dienes. Control studies (no ischemia) showed no change in parameters of lipid peroxidation during 1 h of perfusion and ventilation with 20% or 95% O2. With 60 min of ischemia, there was increased lipid peroxidation which varied with oxygen content of the ventilating gas and was markedly inhibited by ventilation with N2. Perfusion with 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid indicated that generation of eicosanoids during ischemia accounted for approximately 40-50% of lung lipid peroxide production. Changes of CO2 content of the ventilating gas (to alter tissue pH) or of perfusate glucose concentration had no effect on lipid peroxidation during ischemia, but perfusion at 8% of the normal flow rate prevented lipid peroxidation. Lung dry/wet weight measured after 3 min of reperfusion showed good correlation between lung fluid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that reperfusion is not necessary for lipid peroxidation with ischemic insult of the lung and provide evidence that elevated PO2 during ischemia accelerates the rate of tissue injury. 
A case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and positive antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies. A 50 year old woman developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity over a three year period. Her CSF contained oligoclonal bands and both her serum and CSF contained antibodies directed against GABA-ergic synapses (antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies). These antibodies have recently been described in cases of stiff man syndrome. Both disorders may be part of a clinical spectrum that has an underlying autoimmune basis. 
Familial breast-ovarian cancer locus on chromosome 17q12-q23. Familial breast cancer has been linked to the D17S74 locus on chromosome 17q. To confirm this finding and to investigate whether ovarian cancer is also linked to this locus, five large families with a hereditary predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovary were investigated. Three families were positive for linkage. For the largest family the lod score was 2.72. These findings suggest that the chromosomal region 17q12-q23, previously shown to contain a gene for early-onset breast cancer, is also associated with a proportion of hereditary ovarian cancers. 
Neuromyotonia in hereditary motor neuropathy. Two siblings with a distal motor neuropathy experienced cramping and difficulty in relaxing their muscles after voluntary contraction. Electromyographic recordings at rest revealed repetitive high voltage spontaneous electrical discharges that were accentuated after voluntary contraction and during ischaemia. Regional neuromuscular blockage with curare indicated hyperexcitability of peripheral nerve fibres and nerve block suggested that the ectopic activity originated in proximal segments of the nerve. Symptoms were improved with diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine and tocainide. 
Trans-hydroxyl group configuration on carbons 2 and 3 of glucose. Responsible for acute inhibition of myo-inositol transport? Cultured neuroblastoma, cerebral microvessel endothelial, and retinoblastoma cells were used to examine the mechanism of acute inhibition by D-glucose of myo-inositol uptake. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM D-glucose caused a significant decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake in all three cell types. The effect of D-glucose to acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake was dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration and was not reversed by sorbinil. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (30 mM), 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (30 mM), and cytochalasin B (100 microM) did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. These data suggest that the hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of D-glucose, which in a Haworth projection appear trans to each other, are important for inhibitory activity. Other monosaccharides (30 mM) having a similar 2,3-trans-diol configuration, L-glucose, D- and L-fucose, D- and L-galactose, D- and L-xylose, and D-arabinose, all to varying degrees significantly inhibited myo-inositol uptake. In all cases, the L-isomers were more potent inhibitors of myo-inositol uptake than the corresponding D-isomers. Monosaccharides (30 mM) having hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 in a cis configuration, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-allose, and D-ribose, did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. Replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbons 2 or 3 of D-glucose negated its inhibitory activity of myo-inositol uptake. In contrast, replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbon 6 of D-glucose did not block its inhibition of myo-inositol uptake. 
Pathogenesis of edema in constrictive pericarditis. Studies of body water and sodium, renal function, hemodynamics, and plasma hormones before and after pericardiectomy. BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal). The ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter measured by echocardiography was only minimally increased (1.29 +/- 0.04), indicating that in constrictive pericarditis the atria are prevented from expanding. The studies repeated after pericardiectomy in the eight patients showed that all measurements returned toward normal. CONCLUSIONS. The restricted distensibility of the atria, in constrictive pericarditis, limits the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor and, thus, reduces its natriuretic and diuretic effects. This results in retention of water and sodium greater than that occurring in patients with edema from myocardial disease. The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance. 
Tumor size in endometrial cancer. Tumor size was determined in 142 patients with clinical Stage I endometrial cancer treated primarily by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymph node biopsies between July 1979 and August 1988. Only 4% of patients with tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm had lymph node metastasis; this increased to 15% for tumors more than 2 cm and increased further to 35% when the entire uterine cavity was involved (multivariate P = 0.01). Five-year survival was 98% for patients with tumors less than or equal to 2 cm, 84% with tumors more than 2 cm, and 64% with tumors involving the whole uterine cavity (Mantel-Cox P = 0.005). For endometrial cancer patients with Grade 2 tumors and less than one-half myometrial invasion, the risk of lymph node metastasis is often considered too low to justify adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy. This intermediate-risk group is better defined by including tumor size as a prognostic factor. For this subgroup (Grade 2, less than one-half endometrial invasion) there were no lymph node metastasis associated with tumors less than 2 cm, but 18% had nodal disease when tumors were larger than 2 cm. Tumor size is an important prognostic factor that is particularly helpful in directing adjuvant radiation therapy in patients without staging lymph node biopsies. 
Isradipine in the treatment of hypertension. Some additional effects observed during a one-year study. After a placebo run-in phase of four weeks' duration, 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily orally was administered for one year to 23 patients who had been diagnosed as hypertensive. Good control of blood pressure was recorded in the majority of patients until the third month of treatment. After five months, it was necessary to add a beta-blocker to the treatment regimens of some of the patients in order to maintain the target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were exercise-tested using bicycle ergometry. After three months, diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during exercise when comparing the treatment values with those taken at the end of the placebo run-in (baseline values). Values for systolic blood pressure did not differ between treatment and baseline. These results may be explained by the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance produced by isradipine. After one year, the results were modified by the administration of the beta-blocker bopindolol (Sandonorm, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basle, Switzerland). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels did not change during treatment. Triglycerides were lower after three months, but slightly higher after one year, with an average value lying within the normal range. The influence of isradipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels was followed by measuring values at rest and during exercise. It was found that PRA was higher during the first three months, then inversely inhibited to lower levels. Aldosterone levels were also increased after three months, but without a subsequent decrease. The results are compared with those obtained with diltiazem in a similar treatment regimen. 
Induction of HL60 cell differentiation by tiazofurin and its analogues: characterization and efficacy. Among inducers of myeloid differentiation for leukemic cells, tiazofurin is of special interest because its mechanism of action is known; it inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thus decreases the guanine nucleotide pool. Reported here are three aspects of tiazofurin induction of myeloid differentiation in HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, inductive efficacy was evaluated for analogues ara-tiazofurin, xylo-tiazofurin, and selenazofurin, for dinucleotide anabolites thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD), and for a phosphodiesterase-resistant TAD analogue, beta-methylene TAD. The results showed that the parent compounds are more effective inducers than the dinucleotide derivatives and that the selenazole analogues are more effective inducers than the thiazole compounds. Second, HL60 cell induction by tiazofurin was shown to be synergistic with that produced by the antiviral agent ribavirin. Finally, tiazofurin was found to induce expression of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-sensitive Fc gamma-receptor III (FcRIII) on HL60 cells, a feature consistent with neutrophilic, but not monocytic, differentiation. 
Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A before, during, and after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with alteplase. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase. 
Mammography-guided stereotactic fine-needle aspiration cytology of nonpalpable breast lesions: prospective comparison with surgical biopsy results. We assessed the usefulness of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in evaluating nonpalpable breast abnormalities by prospectively performing stereotactic mammography-guided FNAC on 100 women undergoing surgical excisional biopsy. Mammographic and cytologic diagnoses, on a scale of 1 (benign) to 4 (malignant), were assigned for each case and compared with the surgical pathologic diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity were examined at different diagnostic cutoff points for regarding a mammographic or cytologic diagnosis as positive or negative. Of the 100 breast biopsy specimens, 70 were benign and 30 were malignant. For both mammography and FNAC, the optimal diagnostic cutoff point was between diagnosis 2 (mammography, probably benign; cytology, atypical) and 3 (mammography and cytology both suspicious for malignancy). At this cutoff point, FNAC had a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 1.00, vs 0.73 sensitivity and 0.79 specificity for mammography. Pearson coefficient analysis revealed significant correlations between both mammographic and FNAC diagnoses and surgical pathology (p less than .001 for both). Our results suggest that use of mammography-guided FNAC may reduce the number of breast biopsies performed for benign lesions. 
Heterotopic bone formation after hip replacement. The influence of the type of osteoarthritis. The relationship between heterotopic bone formation and the morphological type of osteoarthritis was examined after 43 hip replacements. Of the 43 hips studied, nine were atrophic, 19 were normotrophic, and 15 were hypertrophic. The incidence of heterotopic bone formation in the atrophic type was 11%, in the normotrophic type 32%, and in the hypertrophic type 87%. The difference between each type was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). 
Compliance of adolescents with coeliac disease with a gluten free diet. A cohort of 123 patients with coeliac disease, diagnosed in the first three years of life and followed up for at least 10 years, was reevaluated during the teenage period in terms of compliance with the diet and clinical state. Mucosal structure and lymphocytes were assessed in small intestinal biopsy specimens obtained from 36 subjects, by computerised image analysis. Of these adolescents with coeliac disease, 65% were adhering to a strict gluten free diet, 11.4% were on a gluten free diet but with occasional gluten intake, and 23.6% were on a gluten containing diet. Clinical symptoms occurred more frequently in patients on a gluten containing diet, but not in patients on a semi-strict diet. Occasional intake of small amounts (0.06-2 g/day) of gluten did not produce increased concentrations of antigliadin antibodies but resulted in an appreciably increased crypt epithelial volume and expanded crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte population. 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
X-linked hypophosphatemia. Genetic and clinical correlates. X-linked hypophosphatemia is a hereditary form of rickets that results from an isolated renal tubular wasting of phosphate. The clinical features unique to this disorder, and the recent advances in our understanding of vitamin D metabolism and molecular genetics in X-linked hypophosphatemia are reviewed. Finally, a succinct critique of the controversial treatment modalities round up this review. 
Necrosis of the small intestine after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Small bowel infarction following abdominal aortic reconstruction is extremely rare, and the prognosis remains poor. This report describes a 65-year-old man with small bowel infarction after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was successfully treated with resection of the ischemic segment from the distal duodenum to the mid-small bowel and construction of a duodenoileostomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. 
Association of Epstein-Barr virus with undifferentiated gastric carcinomas with intense lymphoid infiltration. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Some undifferentiated gastric carcinomas with intense lymphoid infiltration have a striking resemblance to nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma. The authors identified eight such cases (seven patients from Japan and one from the United States) of undifferentiated gastric carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma [LELC]) and examined them for Epstein-Barr (EBV) viral sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. EBV was detected in seven of the eight cases by PCR, including a lymph-node metastasis. ISH that was performed in six of these cases showed EBV genomes to be uniformly present in the carcinoma cells and not present in the reactive lymphoid infiltrate or normal gastric mucosa. PCR of a polymorphic EBV locus (lymphocyte-determined membrane antigen) showed that a single genotype was present in each gastric LELC, consistent with a clonal process. These findings suggest that some undifferentiated gastric carcinomas are EBV-related and that focal EBV infection occurs before transformation. 
The use of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with aortic aneurysms. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) has revolutionized management of most patients with urolithiasis. The effect of ESWL on patients with an aortic aneurysm is unknown and its safety is questioned by the absence of any case reports in the urological literature. A 68-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent successful ESWL using the Medstone STS 1050 lithotriptor for right renal calculi. Continuous monitoring of the aneurysm was done using real-time ultrasound during the ESWL treatment. Careful preoperative evaluation in conjunction with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative monitoring makes ESWL management of patients with associated aortic aneurysm possible. 
Arthroscopic surgery for treatment of closed lock. This study evaluates the first 51 consecutive cases treated for limitation of mandibular movement due to closed lock. Eighty joints (22 unilateral, 29 bilateral) were treated with arthroscopic surgery. The mean follow-up was 29.4 weeks, with a range of 6 to 77 weeks. These results showed an immediate improvement after arthroscopy followed by a more gradual improvement during the next 6 months, with a plateau in improvement thereafter. All cases, unilateral and bilateral, generally reached the same level of opening. 
Laser treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions. Benign cutaneous vascular lesions have been treated with a wide array of modalities. Lasers are a comparatively new form of treatment for cutaneous blood vessel abnormalities. Initially, results following laser treatment were disappointing, primarily because of widespread thermal injury to surrounding normal tissue. Recent developments in laser technology and the introduction of the tunable dye laser offer the ability to selectively target laser energy at specific chromophores such as oxyhemoglobin. The technique of selective photothermolysis provides successful treatment of benign vascular lesions with minimal damage to adjacent structures. 
Lipoprotein profiles in hypercholesterolemic children [published erratum appears in Am J Dis Child 1991 May;145(5):515] Atherosclerosis is a process that begins in early life. Coronary heart disease is the result of complex interactions among a variety of risk factors of which hypercholesterolemia is but one. During routine screening, 500 children were identified with total cholesterol levels above the 95th percentile of 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Lipoprotein profiles were then performed to confirm and delineate their lipid abnormalities. A definable lipid disorder was present in 85% of such children. Abnormal lipoprotein patterns included 292 children with type IIa, 99 with type IIb, and 25 with type IV phenotypes. An abnormally low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL) was observed in 20 children. Only 5% of patients were identified as being hypercholesterolemic because they had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels above the 95th percentile of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Thirty-two percent of children with total cholesterol levels above 5.2 mmol/L had a family member (sibling, parent, uncle, aunt, or grandparent) with a myocardial infarction prior to 55 years of age. Data from this study support universal cholesterol testing after 3 years of age and lipoprotein profiles for those with levels above 5.2 mmol/L. 
Incidence of ultrasound-detected intrahepatic hematomas due to Tru-cut needle liver biopsy. This is a prospective study in which 120 patients with diffuse liver disease undergoing liver biopsy were followed by serial ultrasounds to determine the incidence of postbiopsy intrahepatic hematoma formation. Forty-five of the patients had a blind biopsy, while the remaining 75 patients had a biopsy performed during laparoscopy. In both groups a 2.0-mm Tru-cut needle was employed. The overall incidence of postbiopsy hematoma formation was 18.3%, with approximately the same results occurring in blind biopsy patients (20%) and laparoscopy-guided biopsy patients (17%). Only two patients had significant pain associated with the hematoma formation (one from each group), one of whom had evidence of intraperitoneal bleed and rebleed. Our results suggest that postbiopsy asymptomatic hematomas occur more frequently than had been generally thought and that laparoscopy-guided biopsy is not safer than blind biopsy. 
Splenosis presenting as a left renal mass indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. Splenosis following splenic trauma is a common but underdiagnosed entity before surgical exploration. In all previously reported cases the ectopic splenic tissue was distinctly separate from the kidney. To our knowledge we report the first known case in which the splenic tissue was located in direct apposition with the kidney. Using conventional imaging techniques, including renal ultrasonography, abdominal computerized tomography and selective renal arteriography, this ectopic splenic tissue appeared to be part of the left kidney and was indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic studies of splenosis are reviewed. 
The effects of alcohol on the female brain: a neuropathological study. This quantitative neuropathological study compared the brains of seventeen alcoholic females with twenty non-alcoholic female controls. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the pericerebral space value (control 9.5; alcoholic 16.3) indicating shrinkage of the brain. Cerebral grey and white matter volumes were determined morphometrically. There was a significant decrease in the cerebral white matter volume (P less than .02) in the alcoholics. The cerebral grey matter volume was unchanged. These changes parallel those described previously in male alcoholics. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relative severity of the brain damage in males and females. 
Failed back surgery syndrome: 5-year follow-up in 102 patients undergoing repeated operation. The indications for repeated operation in patients with persistent or recurrent pain after lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established. Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and in no case has mean follow-up exceeded 3 years. We report 5-year mean follow-up for a series of repeated operations performed between 1979 and 1983. Patient characteristics and modes of treatment have been assessed as predictors of long-term outcome. One hundred two patients with "failed back surgery syndrome" (averaging 2.4 previous operations), who underwent a repeated operation for lumbosacral decompression and/or stabilization, were interviewed by a disinterested third party a mean of 5.05 years postoperatively. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain for 2 years or at last follow-up, and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 34% of patients. Twenty-one patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work postoperatively; 15 who were working preoperatively became disabled or retired postoperatively. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded, overall, as often as decrements. Loss of neurological function (strength, sensation, bowel and bladder control) was reported by patients more often than improvement. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for young patients and for female patients. Favorable outcome also was associated with a history of good results from previous operations, with the absence of epidural scar requiring surgical lysis, with employment before surgery, and with predominance of radicular (as opposed to axial) pain. 
Extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma. Extramedullary hematopoiesis and paraneoplastic erythrocytosis are uncommon in cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and their concomitant occurrence has not been reported. In a study of 26 cases of hemangioblastoma, we found extramedullary hematopoiesis in 4 tumors; one was associated with erythrocytosis. The significance of this association and the possible histogenetic origin of extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma are discussed. 
Cardiomyopathy in blacks. The intent in this chapter has been to bring to general awareness the fact that myocardial dysfunction represents a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease affecting blacks; in particular, dilated cardiomyopathy is a new frontier in cardiology, which demands an aggressive approach. At present, the prognosis is not good in the majority of cases; despite the best medical therapy, most of those with cardiomyopathy are doomed to death within a few years after the onset of congestive heart failure. Many of these are young African-American men in the prime of their lives. Cardiac transplantation offers some hope from this desperate situation, but donor shortages as well as restrictive criteria for prospective recipients and socioeconomic constraints, which may deny many blacks the opportunity to receive a transplant, make this option less than ideal. 
Pathogenesis of migraine. Endothelial cells are not just a semipermeable membrane that forms a barrier between the blood and the vascular smooth muscles. This cell system is a highly active metabolic endocrine organ. It not only produces a number of important substances in vascular and neural homeostasis but also inactivates vasoactive substances such as serotonin and bradykinin. In addition, it produces endothelin-1 and angiotensin II; more importantly in the context of migraine, endothelial cells produce the vasodilators prostacyclin and EDRF-NO, both of which are local (paracrine) hormones. The physiologic function of endothelial cells is affected by aspirin, which prevents prostacyclin formation but has little effect on normal blood pressure. From this information, one can infer that endothelial cell production of prostacyclin does not play an important part in normal cardiovascular control. On the other hand, the administration of Ng-monomethyl-L-arginine causes immediate increases in blood pressure. Because the administration of this substance inhibits the release of EDRF-NO, it appears that this paracrine endothelial hormone actively dilates the normal circulation. It is of cardinal importance that damage or flow perturbations of cell membranes of the endothelial lining of blood vessels cause an increased production of prostaglandins. However, smooth muscle cells underlying the endothelial lining also synthesize prostacyclin. This mechanism is thought to be held in reserve to reinforce local production of prostacyclin and vasodilatation when cell damage to the endothelial lining occurs and EDRF-No is not produced. Many theories for the causation of migraine have been proposed, and some have been reviewed. Those holding sway tend to ignore inconsistencies and cite supporting evidence in favor of their pet explanation only. I therefore have no hesitation to show that the best explanation at present, based on the most recent cellular evidence, explains all features of migraine and the response of migraineurs to therapy. The endothelial cell is the most likely site of the primary abnormality (Fig. 1). Although under physiologic circumstances perivascular innervation and endothelial systems closely interact in the control of vascular tone during pathologic conditions such as ischemia, the dominant role in protecting the circulation is endothelium-mediated. The biology of headache is so diverse and our ignorance sufficiently pervasive that the investigation of endothelial cell function may solve the mystery of migraine. To match the postulated crucial role of the endothelial cell in the pathogenesis of migraine, another cell would have to be ubiquitously present throughout the vasculature and not just confined to the central nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Use of bipolar endoprosthesis and bone grafting for acetabular reconstruction. Reconstruction operations for severe acetabular defects using bone grafting and a bipolar hemiarthroplasty retrospectively reviewed in 81 hips between 1983 and 1985. The most common indication was failed total hip arthroplasty. Bone grafts consisted of cancellous bone, bone blocks, and wafer-type grafts used singly or in combination. The follow-up period was 12 to 36 months postoperatively (mean, 16 months). There were 22 perioperative complications (27%) and 13 postoperative complications (16.7%). A majority of hips showed some graft resorption and component migration that worsened with time. There were four graft failures with subluxation of the component, one prosthesis dislocation, and one component disassembly. Ten hips had revision (13.3%) for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, clinically, most patients (83%) believed the procedure had improved their condition. Reconstruction for severe acetabular defects can be achieved successfully using this technique, but long-term follow-up evaluation is needed to fully assess the role of this procedure in relation to other available options. 
Calcifying odontogenic cyst. A review of ninety-two cases with reevaluation of their nature as cysts or neoplasms, the nature of ghost cells, and subclassification. Ninety-two cases of calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) were reviewed with special consideration of their nature as cysts or neoplasms, the nature of ghost cells, and classification on the basis of clinicopathologic features. The cases were divided into 79 (85.9%) cysts and 13 (14.1%) neoplasms. The cysts occurred as four variants: (1) nonproliferative COC (35 cases), characterized by a simple unicystic structure; (2) proliferative COC (17 cases), characterized by a cystic structure with multiple daughter cysts, extensive ghost cell formations, and marked tendency for calcification; (3) ameloblastomatous COC (11 cases), characterized by ameloblastoma-like, cyst-lining epithelium with ghost cells and calcifications; and (4) COC associated with odontoma (16 cases), which combined features of COC and odontoma. The neoplasms occurred as three variants: (1) ameloblastoma ex COC (two cases), which showed unifocal and multifocal intraluminal and intramural ameloblastoma proliferating from the COC-lining epithelium; (2) peripheral epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (eight cases), which occurred in the gingiva and resembled peripheral ameloblastoma except for clustered ghost cells in the central portion of epithelial islands and the presence of juxtaepithelial dentinoid; and (3) central epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (three cases). The latter showed ameloblastomatous or adenomatoid odontogenic tumor-like epithelial clusters with ghost cell formation and juxtaepithelial dentinoid. The clinical features of cystic and neoplastic variants were tabulated and described. On the basis of histopathologic features and their immunohistochemical reaction to polyclonal antikeratin antibody, it is suggested that ghost cells might be the result of coagulative necrosis. 
Expression of shared idiotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. The expression of shared idiotypes (Slds) has been studied on malignant CD5+B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) using a panel of 37 murine monoclonal antibodies previously demonstrated to be reactive with Slds derived from follicular B-cell lymphomas. Thirteen anti-Slds identified tumor cells from 31 of 105 (30%) CLL patients and 4 of 6 SLL patients. In comparison, the same panel of anti-Slds is reactive with 33% of follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Ten of these anti-Slds reacted with CLL cases at similar frequencies to that of the B-cell lymphomas. Two anti-Slds, which are known to react with autoantibodies, were significantly more prevalent in CLL than in B-cell lymphomas. These data confirm the presence of Slds in CLL and provide further evidence of an association between CLL and autoimmunity. The identification of a panel of antibodies reactive with a significant number of CLL and SLL patients will facilitate the application of anti-idiotype antibody therapy in these diseases. 
Reversible operculum syndrome caused by progressive epilepsia partialis continua in a child with left hemimegalencephaly. In a child with left hemimegalencephaly and seizures, a reversible operculum syndrome developed when continuous epileptic discharges spread from the left hemisphere to the contralateral central regions. The operculum syndrome lasted for three months until left hemispherectomy was performed. Soon after surgery the seizures and the operculum syndrome resolved. The operculum syndrome is a facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory diplegia usually due to structural lesions in both opercular regions. The reversibility of the syndrome in the reported case demonstrates that the operculum syndrome is sometimes functional rather than lesional. 
Ceftriaxone-associated gallbladder sludge. Identification of calcium-ceftriaxone salt as a major component of gallbladder precipitate Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is partially excreted into bile. With its clinical use, the formation of gallbladder sludge detected by ultrasonography has been reported. Four surgical specimens were examined and no gallstones were found. Instead, fine precipitates of 20-250 microns were present. Microscopically, there was a small number of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and bilirubin granules among an abundant amount of granular-crystalline material that was not morphologically cholesterol monohydrate crystals. The chemical composition of the precipitates (n = 4) was determined. There was a small amount of cholesterol (1.7% +/- 0.8%) and bilirubin (13.9% +/- 0.74%). The major component of the precipitate was a residue. On further analysis using thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electron microprobe analysis, the residue was identified as a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The residue also had identical crystal morphology and chromatographic elution profile as authentic calcium-ceftriaxone standards. It is concluded that ceftriaxone, after excretion and being concentrated in the gallbladder bile, can form a precipitate. The major constituent has been identified as a ceftriaxone-calcium salt. 
Distal transfer of the greater trochanter. After congenital dislocation of the hip, Perthes' disease and some other conditions, the femoral neck may be short and the greater trochanter in a relatively proximal position. Distal transfer of the greater trochanter is an effective and relatively simple operation to correct this deformity. We have reviewed 26 patients (27 hips) at a mean follow-up of eight years. Pain relief and improvement in gait were maintained in 74%, and the poor results were largely due to progression of osteoarthritis. We describe a 'gear-stick' sign of trochanteric impingement, which is useful in the pre-operative assessment of patients. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
The activity of 22-oxacalcitriol in osteoblast-like (ROS 17/2.8) cells. 22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT), a synthetic vitamin D analog, can mimic the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25-(OH)2D3] to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response and to suppress PTH secretion, but has much less calcemic activity. The mechanism for this selective action is not understood. OCT has been shown to have a diminished ability to mobilize calcium from bone in vivo, but in vitro findings are contradictory. Little is known about the effect of OCT on bone forming cells. Therefore, the present studies were designed to investigate the actions of OCT at the molecular level in the osteoblast-like cell line, ROS 17/2.8. 3H-OCT was bound to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in intact cells at the same rate as 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3. As previously found for 1,25-(OH)2D3, the time course of specific binding of OCT was biphasic, with an initial plateau at 1 h and a further increase from 2-8 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that exposure to 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3 increased VDR from 24 fmol/mg protein at 2 h to 85 fmol/mg protein at 8 h. Exposure to 3H-OCT increased VDR from 22 to 76 fmol/mg protein, indicating that OCT is also capable of up-regulating the VDR in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In contrast to the lower affinity of OCT for VDR reported for chick intestine and HL-60 cells, the Kd for OCT in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells was identical to that for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of OCT on osteocalcin secretion and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells was also determined. Pretreatment for 24 h with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of osteocalcin secretion. A 2-fold stimulation by both compounds was observed with 10(-7)M. ALP activity was measured after a 72-h incubation with 10(-7)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT. Both compounds increased ALP activity to the same extent. Stimulation by OCT of VDR levels, ALP activity, and osteocalcin secretion were inhibited by the addition of 5 microM cycloheximide, indicating that these actions of OCT require new protein synthesis. Thus, OCT, like 1,25-(OH)2D3, up-regulates the vitamin D receptor, stimulates osteocalcin secretion, and increases ALP activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, suggesting that the analog may be as active as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in stimulating bone formation in vivo. The low activity of OCT in mobilizing calcium from bone in vivo does not appear to be due to an inability of this compound to act on osteoblasts. 
Neuropsychologic test performance in amateur boxers. Cognitive functions of 23 amateur boxers were assessed immediately before and after an amateur boxing event. A range of cognitive measures were employed including tasks of verbal, figural, and incidental memory, motor functions, attention and concentration, and information processing speed. Compared to their prefight performance, boxers demonstrated impairments in verbal and incidental memory, but enhanced executive and motor functions postfight. There were no observed differences between winners and losers on any of the measures. The results are compared to other studies that have shown only minor changes in cognitive functions in amateur boxers compared to controls. 
Headaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. 
Enterococcal meningitis in an HIV positive haemophilic patient. A 25 year old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive, severe haemophilic patient was treated for suspected Pneumocystis carinii infection with high dose intravenous cotrimoxazole and subsequently with prednisolone. When he improved he was discharged on oral treatment only to return two days later, extremely unwell, with headaches, fever, sweats, tachycardia and hypotension. A lumbar puncture showed modest neutrophil pleocytosis but despite empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and cefuroxime he continued to deteriorate. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid subsequently grew Enterococcus faecalis that was resistant to trimethoprim and sensitive to ampicillin, rifampicin, and vancomycin. After a change in treatment to intravenous ampicillin and rifampicin he dramatically improved. Enterococcal meningitis is rare in adults but important to recognise and treat appropriately in view of its high mortality and relative resistance to antibiotics. In our case the combination of HIV infection and previous treatment with antibiotics or steroids, or both, were probable predisposing factors. 
By how much does dietary salt reduction lower blood pressure? III--Analysis of data from trials of salt reduction [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Apr 20;302(6782):939] OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations, and, if so, to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease. DESIGN--Analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reduction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis. RESULTS--In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions. This applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressure. In people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm Hg, and by 7 mm Hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm Hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much. It is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole Western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 22% and of ischaemic heart disease by 16% [corrected]. CONCLUSIONS--The results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papers. The effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantial--larger, indeed, than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugs. However, reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 75,000 [corrected] deaths a year in Britain as well as much disability. 
Hypertrophic repair of canine articular cartilage in osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament transection. Transection of the anterior cruciate ligament in the dog is used frequently to produce a model of osteoarthritis (OA). Although it results in metabolic, biochemical, biomechanical and morphological changes in the articular cartilage of the unstable knee which resemble those in human OA, it rarely results in full thickness cartilage loss. The lack of progression of the cartilage lesions in this model has generally been attributed to stabilization of the joint by osteophytes and capsular fibrosis which develop following transection of the ligament. In our study transection of the anterior cruciate ligament of adult foxhounds and mongrels resulted in a progressive increase in the amount of articular cartilage in the unstable knee. In articular cartilage from the medial femoral condyle of the unstable knee the total amount of proteoglycan, as assessed by hexuronic acid analysis, and, often, the proteoglycan concentration were increased. Furthermore, the rate of proteoglycan synthesis was commonly elevated, in comparison with that from the contralateral knee. Thus, in these animals knee instability did not lead to loss of cartilage but to an active synthetic response by the chondrocytes resulting in hypertrophic cartilage repair which was sustained for up to 64 weeks of observation. 
Hydrogen peroxide as a mediator of dopac-induced effects on melanoma cells. Dopac increases tyrosinase activity and exerts cytotoxic effects in cultures of human melanoma cells. The possible role of hydrogen peroxide in these actions was examined. Catalase (100 micrograms/ml) completely reversed the cytotoxic action of 0.3 mM dopac and reduced its tyrosinase-stimulating effect by approximately one half. The results show that extracellular hydrogen peroxide is a mediator of both the tyrosinase-stimulating and cytotoxic actions of dopac. Analysis of the degradation products of melanin from dopac-treated melanoma cells after hydriodic acid (HI) hydrolysis revealed the presence of aminohydroxy-phenylacetic acid (AHPAc). This substance is obtained by HI hydrolysis of melanin formed by oxidation of cysteinyl-dopac. Thus, the presence of AHPAc indicates that dopac is transported into the melanocytes where it serves as a substrate for tyrosinase. 
Angiotensin II causes vascular hypertrophy in part by a non-pressor mechanism. Angiotensin II, when given in low doses, raises blood pressure slowly. When tested in vitro on vascular smooth muscle cells, it has mitogenic and trophic effects; it is not known if it has these effects in vivo. Our purpose was to determine whether vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II and, if so, whether it is pressure induced. Three experiments were done in rats infused subcutaneously with angiotensin II (200 ng/kg/min) by minipump for 10-12 days. Experiment 1: Angiotensin II gradually raised systolic blood pressure (measured in the tail) from 143 +/- 2 to 208 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), significantly suppressing plasma renin and increasing threefold (NS) plasma angiotensin II. There was no loss of peptide in the pump infusate when tested at the end of the experiment. Experiment 2: In the perfused mesenteric circulation, vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and KCl were enhanced in rats given a slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II, but sensitivity of responses was not altered. This combination of changes suggests that vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II. Experiment 3: Vessel myography was done after angiotensin II infusion with and without a pressor response. Angiotensin II raised systolic blood pressure, increased heart weight, and produced myographic changes of vascular hypertrophy in the mesenteric circulation, increasing media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio. Hydralazine given with angiotensin II prevented the rise of pressure and the cardiac effect but not the vascular changes. Two-way analysis of variance showed that angiotensin II significantly increased media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio, all independent of hydralazine. Thus, although hydralazine inhibits the pressor and cardiac effects of angiotensin II, suggesting a pressor mechanism for the cardiac change, it does not inhibit structural vascular change, which suggests that at least part of the effect has a non-pressor mechanism. 
Incidence of aneurysms in Takayasu's arteritis. The angiographic findings of Takayasu's arteritis in a series of 113 patients were reviewed. Predominant findings were stenotic or occlusive changes, but fusiform or saccular aneurysms were also found in 36 patients (31.9%) in the various sites of aorta and its major branches. Multiple aneurysms were found in 15 patients. The most common site of aneurysms was the ascending aorta (16 patients); in 7 of the patients these were complicated by aortic regurgitation. Aneurysms developed in the aortic arch in 3 patients, in the descending aorta in 11, in the abdominal aorta in 7, and in the major branches of the aortic arch in 9 patients. In 2 patients, follow-up angiograms showed enlargement of the aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 1 patient. Aneurysms were found even in young patients. A fifteen-year-old female showed a huge aneurysm in the ascending aorta as the initial manifestation of this disease. Thickening of the walls of aneurysms was common and characteristic. This study revealed the moderately high incidence of aneurysms of various sites of arteries in patients with Takayasu's arteritis. The authors conclude that aneurysm, as well as occlusive changes, can be a primary lesion. 
Clinical doxorubicin chemomyectomy. An experimental treatment for benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Doxorubicin (DXR) was injected as a treatment for benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. The other eyelids were treated concurrently with botulinum toxin (BT). No DXR-treated eyelid has maintained 0 strength (commonly achieved with BT). Two patients with benign essential blepharospasm and four patients with hemifacial spasm have achieved major improvement, sustained for more than 6 months. Eyelids have been swollen and inflamed for up to 3 months. No spontaneously irreversible complication has occurred. A single injection at the maximum safe dose (1 mg in the upper lid and 1.5 mg in the lower lid) has not proven sufficient to produce cure. Treatment of each lower eyelid of a muscular male with severe blepharospasm may require cumulative doses of up to 4.0 mg, delivered in three injection events separated by at least 2 months, with each injection no greater than 1.5 mg DXR per site. At the present time, there is no assurance that a permanent cure will result. 
Assessment of proliferative potential in gliomatosis cerebri. The proliferative potential of neoplastic cells in two cases of gliomatosis cerebri was investigated by a combined staining technique, a one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated protein (AgNOR) and immunohistochemistry for fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The neoplastic cells in the two cases had an abnormal shape and showed positive GFAP immunostaining in their cytoplasm. The numbers of AgNORs were counted in central and peripheral lesions of the neoplastic field in each case. The mean AgNOR scores in neoplastic cells were almost the same as those of nonneoplastic astrocytes in both the central and the peripheral lesions. These values were almost equal to the AgNOR score of low-grade gliomas. These findings indicate that gliomatosis cerebri has an invasive character in the central nervous system and often shows a malignant tendency, but its proliferative potential is significantly lower than that of high-grade gliomas. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the lower limbs in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A. In a 36-month period, 240 patients at our institution received kidney transplants from cadaver donors. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the initial immunosuppressive therapy. Seven patients (5 men and 2 women) developed severe pain, periarticular soft tissue swelling with no effusion, and vasomotor changes in affected areas. Although articular mobility was conserved, most of the patients had great difficulty in walking. A patchy osteoporotic pattern was seen radiographically and increased uptake of 99mtechnetium with a periarticular distribution in the clinically affected areas were found. All of these symptoms and radiographic and scintigraphic signs are compatible with definite reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). Articular symptoms began within 3 months after kidney transplantation in all patients; all but 1 patient had plasma CsA levels greater than 200 ng/ml at that time. When the dosage of CsA was reduced, there was concomitant improvement in the RSDS, which appeared when the plasma CsA levels declined to less than 200 ng/ml. The mean duration of the clinical symptoms of RSDS was 8 months. We believe RSDS should be added to the list of complications that may appear in kidney transplant patients who receive CsA treatment. 
Human papillomavirus DNA sequences in cell lines derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. There is increasing evidence that human papillomaviruses (HPV) have a casual role in some neoplasms in human beings. As examples, DNA of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are frequently present in genital cancers in humans. Recently, oncogenic HPV types have also been identified in neoplasms of the head and neck, including verrucous carcinoma of the larynx, squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and larynx, and inverted papillomas of the nose. These findings and our resource of an extensive panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines led us to begin to investigate how frequently HPV DNA was present in these tumor cell lines. For initial analysis, twenty-two HNSCC cell lines derived from 20 patients' tumors were selected as representative of our tumor cell line panel with respect to diversity of primary site, tumor stage, patient age, sex, and clinical course. For Southern analysis, cell line DNA was tested for hybridization with DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was also performed on five tumor cell lines using types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 52 as probes. Southern blot analysis revealed HPV-specific signals in two of the 22 HNSCC cell lines tested. One of these, UM-SCC-23, was HPV 31 positive, which to our knowledge is the first identification of HPV 31 in HNSCC. UM-SCC-63, the other HPV-positive tumor identified by Southern analysis, hybridized with both type 18 and 31. Of the five tumor cell lines tested with PCR, two were HPV positive. 
Assessment of coronary artery patency after thrombolytic therapy: accurate prediction utilizing the combined analysis of three noninvasive markers. The predictability of patency of the infarct-related artery assessed by means of three noninvasive easily obtainable markers was prospectively examined in 82 patients undergoing thrombolysis for their first myocardial infarction. Positive noninvasive markers were defined as follows: 1) early peak creatine kinase (CK) activity less than or equal to 12 h after the start of thrombolysis; 2) greater than or equal to 50% reduction in ST segment elevation; and 3) occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias within the 1st 90 min of thrombolytic therapy. In 63 (77%) of the 82 patients, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade II/III reperfusion was achieved within the 1st 90 min as assessed by coronary angiography. Separate analysis of each marker revealed the following respective values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value regarding prediction of coronary artery patency: CK peak less than or equal to 12 h: 84%, 95%, 98% and 64%; reduction of the ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 50%: 60%, 95%, 97% and 42%; and reperfusion arrhythmias: 63%, 89%, 95% and 43%. The combined analysis of all three markers utilizing a logistic regression procedure showed that CK peak (p = 0.0001) and resolution of the ST segment elevation (p = 0.005), but not the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias (p = 0.26), were independent predictors of vessel patency. From this logistic regression procedure, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 100% for prediction of coronary artery patency were obtained. 
Hypercholesterolemia in diabetes and glucose intolerance in the U.S. population. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, has been determined in a national survey of diabetes and glucose intolerance. Rates of elevated total cholesterol in people with diabetes in the United States are only slightly greater than in those without diabetes after adjusting for age and sex. Nevertheless, high or borderline high total cholesterol is common in diabetes and is present in 70% of adults with diagnosed diabetes and 77% with undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. population. Of these individuals, 95% have evidence of coronary heart disease or two or more risk factors for heart disease and should therefore have their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measured. Based on our national data, LDL cholesterol levels warranting dietary treatment for hypercholesterolemia would be expected in 85% of these people. Although elevated LDL cholesterol is uncommon in people with diabetes who have total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dl, other risk factors for coronary heart disease are very frequent (100% of men, 73% of women), and low total and LDL cholesterol may mask low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, investigation of blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk factors should be routine in all patients with diabetes, and treatment strategies should include management of lipid disorders and the multiple other risk factors for coronary heart disease that are highly prevalent in these patients. 
Breast sonography. Sonographic equipment for breast imaging has continued to improve, and the role of breast sonography has evolved to that of an indispensable adjunct to mammography. Breast sonography is not useful for screening for breast cancer in any age group. Its main use is for the differentiation of cystic vs solid palpable and mammographically visible masses. If strict sonographic criteria are used for a simple cyst, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%. Sonographic diagnosis of a simple cyst precludes the need for further workup, including aspiration, biopsy, or followup. This article emphasizes the technical aspects of breast sonography, especially those factors that alter the diagnostic information on the images. These factors can be especially problematic in differentiating cysts and solid masses, the most common diagnostic use of breast sonography. Selection of equipment depends largely on the requirements of a specific practice. Optimally, the sonographic equipment is located close to where mammography is performed, and the sonographic and mammographic findings are interpreted together. 
Electrocardiographic correlates with left ventricular morphology in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The purpose of the present study was to verify whether the electrocardiographic pattern of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) might be useful in predicting measurements of left ventricular (LV) morphology. A total of 12 electrocardiographic criteria for LV enlargement were evaluated in 67 patients with IDC, aged 14 to 68 years (mean 48), and were correlated to LV wall thickness, volume and mass, as assessed at angiography (all patients) and echocardiography (50 patients). Linear regression analysis showed weak correlations between multiple electrocardiographic criteria and LV wall thickness, volume and mass. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that total 12-lead QRS amplitude, voltage criteria of Sokolow and Lyon, overshoot and U-wave inversion were the variables significantly related to LV wall thickness, as assessed by angiography (r = 0.55, p less than 0.005) and echocardiography (r = 0.43, p less than 0.025). The sum of T/R-wave ratios, the RV6/RV5 ratio and the Romhilt-Estes score were predictors of LV end-diastolic volume, as determined by angiography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) and echocardiography (r = 0.77, p less than 0.005). Total 12-lead QRS amplitude and the sum of T/R-wave ratios were the only independent predictors of LV mass, either angiographically (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) or echocardiographically measured (r = 0.71, p less than 0.025). It is concluded that a single electrocardiographic criterion for prediction of LV morphology in patients with IDC is barely effective. Multiple electrocardiographic criteria should be utilized to better predict LV mass and distinguish reliably between LV wall thickening and dilatation. 
Prevention of cold-induced increase in blood pressure of rats by captopril. To assess the possibility that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the development of cold-induced hypertension, three groups of rats were used. Two groups were exposed to cold (5 +/- 2 degrees C) while the remaining group was kept at 26 +/- 2 degrees C. One group of cold-treated rats received food into which captopril (0.06% by weight) had been thoroughly mixed. The remaining two groups received the same food but without captopril. Systolic blood pressure of the untreated, cold-exposed group increased significantly above that of the warm-adapted, control group within 4 weeks of exposure to cold. In contrast, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure. Rats were killed after 4 months of exposure to cold. At death, the heart, kidneys, adrenal glands, and interscapular brown fat pad were removed and weighed. Although captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure in cold-treated rats, it did not prevent hypertrophy of the kidneys, heart, and interstitial brown adipose tissue that characteristically accompanies exposure to cold. Thus, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure when administered at the time exposure to cold was initiated. It also reduced the elevated blood pressure of cold-treated rats when administered after blood pressure became elevated. This suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the elevation of blood pressure during exposure to cold. 
Detection of T-cell receptor gamma chain V gene rearrangements using the polymerase chain reaction: application to the study of clonal disease cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This report describes the development and characterization of a method for the amplification of rearranged V-J segments of the human T-cell receptor gamma chain (TCRG) locus using an adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The technique uses a single pair of 'consensus' primers to amplify rearrangements involving the V gamma I subgroup genes, which are common in malignant cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Using this method we were able to detect rearrangements in the TCRG locus in disease cells from patients with T-cell ALL (12 of 12), common ALL (10 of 14), and Null cell ALL (2 of 2) at presentation. Monoallelic and biallelic rearrangements involving V gamma I subgroup genes were identified by restriction analysis of PCR products from DNA samples from a T-cell leukemic cell line, T-cell clones, and disease cells from patients with ALL of T-and B-cell lineage at presentation. These results confirmed the presence of cell clones within the presentation samples and, in one case, confirmed the persistence of the original malignant cell clone at relapse. This is a rapid and specific method for the detection and characterization of rearrangements of the TCRG locus without recourse to Southern blotting. Therefore, the PCR technique described herein can provide the basis for the study of clonal evolution and minimal residual disease on a high proportion of patients with ALL. 
Histopathological changes in leiomyomata treated with leuprolide acetate. Several studies have shown a decrease in uterine and/or leiomyoma volume when treated with leuprolide acetate (LA), a widely used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. The mechanism by which these changes occur is unknown. In this study, the histopathological slides of 31 women of reproductive age who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy were blindly reviewed by a pathologist. Seventeen women underwent myomectomy. Among those, 10 were treated with LA. The tumors in all of these patients were reduced in size after therapy. Histopathologically, the LA treatment correlated with a significant reduction in cellularity. No significant change in fibrosis, edema, or mitotic activity was seen. 
A checklist for managing the dementia patient. Primary care physicians seeing a growing number of elderly demented patients must consider a number of problem areas when treating such patients. This article offers the mnemonic FICS'M (Family, Intellectual status, Continence, Sleep, and Mobility) to help physicians address treatable problems associated with dementing illnesses. Strategies are offered to minimize morbidity from the particular problem and from the treatment, such as trying "low toxicity" therapies and medications with few side effects. Other medical, ethical, and legal issues are discussed, including handling dangerous behaviors and abuse, nursing home placement and autopsy, and specific treatment of both the dementia itself and associated disorders--agitation, depression, and delirium. 
Wild-type and e antigen-minus hepatitis B viruses and course of chronic hepatitis. Using an oligonucleotide hybridization assay, we studied the clinical implication of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a HBV mutant that is unable to secrete hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) because of a translational defect due to a stop codon in the pre-C region in 106 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Wild-type HBV was detected in 31 of 42 (73.8%) HBeAg-positive patients, whereas a mixed viral population was present in 10 (23.8%). Significant differences in the severity and outcome of liver disease were not observed in the two groups of patients. However, the emergence of HBeAg-minus HBV in wild-type HBV carriers was associated with an exacerbation of liver disease and was followed by the presence of antibodies against HBeAg (anti-HBe) in serum in 50% of the cases. In 61 of 64 (95.3%) anti-HBe-positive patients, HBeAg-minus HBV was the predominant virus: HBeAg-minus HBV was detected in 42 patients (65.6%), whereas both wild-type and HBeAg-minus HBV were present in 19 (29.7%). HBeAg-minus HBV was associated with a course of hepatitis characterized by flare-ups of liver cell necrosis interspersed with periods of asymptomatic HBV carriage (P less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity of HBV significantly influences the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis B. Wild-type HBV secreting HBeAg induces immunologic tolerance and causes chronic infection. HBeAg-minus HBV might be unable to induce chronic infection without the helper function of wild-type HBV, but it appears to be more pathogenic. Once chronic infection is established, HBeAg-minus HBV variants may prevail and displace wild-type virus. 
Aspirin in transient ischemic attacks and minor stroke: a meta-analysis. An overview analysis of seven randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of aspirin in the treatment of patients with transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes was performed. A total of 6409 patients from the seven trials was entered in the analysis; 2182 patients received only aspirin; 1598 patients received an aspirin-combination regimen with either sulfinpyrazone or dipyridamole; and 2629 subjects received a placebo. Aspirin alone produced an 18% decrease in all strokes and cardiovascular deaths. The pooling of studies examining aspirin-combination regimens and the larger grouping of studies of aspirin and aspirin-combination regimens led to more striking results. Indeed, significant risk reductions were observed for three of the four outcomes, namely, total deaths, total strokes, and total strokes and cardiovascular deaths, with odds ratios ranging from 0.59 to 0.78. Suggestive, albeit more modest, results were obtained when examining the impact of these regimens on total cardiovascular mortality. The same tendencies have also been observed in three previously published meta-analyses. 
Combined (team) approach to hemangioma management: arteriography with superselective embolization plus YAG laser/sapphire-tip resection. Thirteen patients have been treated over a 2-year period utilizing a team approach between the radiology and surgical services. Initial diagnostic evaluation is directed at determining the size and anatomic extent of the hemangioma; clinical assessment of coagulation and hemodynamic status is also performed. Arteriography with superselective embolization precedes the surgical procedure, usually by 24 hours. The YAG laser with contact sapphire-tip scalpels is then utilized for resection and reconstruction of the hemangioma. Total removal of hemangioma was achieved in 9 of 13 patients, and partial or subtotal removal was achieved in the remainder. Blood loss and complications were minimal. 
Induction of inflammatory arthropathy resembling rheumatoid arthritis in mice transgenic for HTLV-I. Human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and has also been suggested to be involved in other diseases such as chronic arthritis or myelopathy. To elucidate pathological roles of the virus in disease, transgenic mice were produced that carry the HTLV-I genome. At 2 to 3 months of age, many of the mice developed chronic arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial and periarticular inflammation with articular erosion caused by invasion of granulation tissues were marked. These observations suggest a possibility that HTLV-I is one of the etiologic agents of chronic arthritis in humans. 
MRI following severe perinatal asphyxia: preliminary experience. In 30 children suffering from severe perinatal asphyxia an attempt was made to determine the early prognostic signs of severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten early (1-4 days of age), 16 intermediate (2-4 weeks of age), and 38 late MRI (older than 1 month of age) procedures were performed on a 2.35 T MR-system. Severe cerebral necrosis was suspected by T2 hyperintensity of the white matter, with blurred limits to the cortex in early MRI, and was confirmed by T1 hyperintensity of the cortex in intermediate MRI. Severe cerebral necrosis was established at 3 months of age. Of the 11 children with this pattern (group A), 8 had severe and 3 had moderate cerebral palsy on subsequent examination. Thirteen children (group B) had normal late MRI scans; none developed severe cerebral palsy or marked mental retardation. Two children (group C) had focal ischemic lesions. Four children had intracranial hemorrhage (group D). Groups A and B did not differ in the severity of their perinatal histories and findings, suggesting that MRI during the first 3 months is of significant prognostic value. 
Papular dermatitis in adults: subacute prurigo, American style? Determining the best treatment for recurrent pruritic papular eruptions that do not fit well into a diagnosis (of either atopy or some other diagnosis) is sometimes frustrating. We have studied 12 patients with recurrent pruritic papular eruptions by obtaining extensive histories and by performing skin biopsies, immunofluorescence studies, and screening patch tests. The eruptions in this group are not atopic by strict criteria but have atopic features and are without a determinable exogenous cause. Histologic features resemble papular urticaria, but there is no history to suggest arthropod bites. Patients with this type of eruption have features similar to those with subacute prurigo, and they respond to variable combinations of topical or systemic corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and UVB or UVA. We suggest that the designation of subacute prurigo might be more appropriate for patients with these findings. 
Complications after intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin: rhabdomyolysis and metastatic infection. Two cases of adverse reaction to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) bladder instillations are reported. In both cases transient fevers and systemic symptoms developed following the instillations. After an additional instillation 1 patient had high fevers, severe myalgias and profound weakness followed by rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure, which required 3 weeks of hemodialysis before recovery. Extensive evaluation revealed no cause other than the BCG instillations. In the other patient a firm subcutaneous nodule gradually developed on the chest wall, which contained nonviable acid fast bacilli. 
Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases. The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma. Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies. Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy. Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Prostate specific antigen: a critical assessment of the most useful tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. PSA is a kallikrein-like, serine protease that is produced exclusively by the epithelial cells of all types of prostatic tissue, benign and malignant. Physiologically, it is present in the seminal fluid at high concentration and functions to cleave the high molecular weight protein responsible for the seminal coagulum into smaller polypeptides. This action results in liquefaction of the coagulum. PSA is also present in the serum and can be measured reliably by either a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay or a polyclonal radioimmunoassay. The calculated half-life of serum PSA ranges from 2.2 to 3.2 days and the metabolic clearance rate of this tumor marker follows first-order kinetics. Digital rectal examination, cystoscopic examination and prostate biopsy all can cause spurious elevations of the serum PSA concentration. Conditions such as bacterial prostatitis and acute urinary retention also can falsely elevate the serum PSA level. Because approximately 25% of the patients with BPH only will have an elevated serum PSA concentration and BPH tissue contributes to this PSA value in a variable manner from patient to patient, it is unlikely that PSA by itself will become an effective screening tool for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, if combined with digital rectal examination and/or transrectal ultrasound it may become a vital part of any early detection program. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia also may be associated with moderately elevated serum PSA levels. Although there is a direct correlation between the serum PSA concentration and clinical stage, PSA is not sufficiently reliable to determine the clinical stage on an individual basis. This finding also applies to pathological stage. As a result, the preoperative serum PSA concentration cannot be used to decide whether to recommend radical prostatectomy for potential cure. Low preoperative serum PSA concentrations in patients with previously untreated prostate cancers are predictive of a negative bone scan. Thus, in these select patients a staging bone scintigram may not be necessary. With respect to monitoring patients after definitive therapy, PSA is an exquisitely sensitive tumor marker. Irrespective of the treatment modality (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or antiandrogen treatment), PSA reflects accurately the tumor status of the patient and is prognostic of eventual outcome; this tumor marker is capable of predicting tumor recurrence months before its detection by any other method. PSA is also a most useful immunocytochemical marker. Its sensitivity and specificity to identify tissue of prostatic origin approach 100%. When compared to PAP, PSA is a more precise and meaningful marker in all clinical situations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The adrenocortical response to brain injury: correlation with the severity of neurologic dysfunction, effects of intoxication, and patient outcome. To test the hypothesis that cortisol levels reflect the extent of neurologic dysfunction and predict patient outcome, neurologic function and cortisol levels were determined in 120 traumatically brain injured patients who never received glucocorticoid treatment. Their mean age was 29 years and 78% were men. The impact of intoxication was examined in 59 patients who had ethanol levels measured. Ethanol was detectable in 40 patients and greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl in 31. There were significant correlations between the extent of neurologic dysfunction, determined by the Glasgow Coma Score and plasma cortisol concentrations 1 and 4 days postaccident. Cortisol levels were universally elevated on admission and approached normal 7 days later. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant effects of circulating ethanol levels on the association between cortisol concentrations and progressively worsening neurologic function, i.e., ethanol reduced the magnitude of the cortisol elevations in a dose dependent manner, abolishing this relationship at levels above 100 mg/dl. Analysis of the relationships between circulating cortisol levels and patient outcome provided a second method for ascertaining the association between injury severity and the magnitude of adrenocortical activation. Admission and day 1 cortisol concentrations were 25 to 40% lower in patients having good recoveries or moderate disabilities than those who remained severely disabled, persistently vegetative or died; serum cortisol values of less than 20 micrograms/dl one day after the accident were more likely to be associated with a good outcome than a poor one (55 vs. 25%, p less than 0.001). The worsening prognosis of patients having higher cortisol values is further reflected in the duration of acute hospitalization of these individuals. 
Syndrome X and hyperventilation. The cardiorespiratory responses to exercise and forced hyperventilation were measured in 17 unselected patients with syndrome X (angina, positive exercise test, normal coronary arteriogram, no other cardiovascular disease) and compared with those in 15 healthy subjects. Forced hyperventilation produced hypocapnia and metabolic alkalosis but no chest pain or electrocardiographic change. Patients with syndrome X showed reduced maximum oxygen consumption with an increased respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise, confirming that exercise was limited by skeletal muscle perfusion--and thus that the increase in cardiac output with exercise is limited in syndrome X as in heart failure. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) homoeostasis during exercise was normal but the ventilatory cost of carbon dioxide excretion was increased in syndrome X (as in heart failure). End tidal PCO2 measurements correlated only poorly with arterial PCO2 in individual patients with syndrome X, providing a possible explanation for previous reports, based on end tidal PCO2 of inappropriate hyperventilation. Patients with syndrome X did not show inappropriate hyperventilation but they did show hyperventilation that was appropriate to maintain normal arterial PCO2 in the face of reduced cardiac reserve. 
Fulminant pulmonary aspergillus infection occluding the aortic arch after high-dose antileukemic chemotherapy. After antileukemic chemotherapy a granulocytopenic patient experienced a rapidly progressive left-sided pneumonia with pleuritic pain. After 1 week, a sudden occlusion of all aortic branches was followed by death. At postmortem, a huge thrombus in the aortic arch caused by Aspergillus invasion from the left lung was found. 
Mid-brain pathology of Wilson's disease: MRI analysis of three cases. MRI scans were obtained from three patients with Wilson's disease, all of whom showed rigidity and dysarthria; two also showed tremor and dystonia. Two had been treated with D-penicillamine for seven and 14 years, respectively and their neurological abnormalities had improved, but the third patient had not been treated. T2-weighted MRI of the mid-brain in all three revealed the characteristic "face of the giant panda" sign, consisting of high signal intensity in the tegmentum except for red nucleus, preservation of signal intensity of the lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and hypo-intensity of the superior colliculus. The clinical significance of these MRI abnormalities is discussed. 
Sickle cell disease and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. While neurological complications are common in sickle cell disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has been rarely reported. A case is presented of a young man with sickle cell disease and subarachnoid hemorrhage found to have two mid-basilar aneurysms, the largest of which had bled. Available literature suggests that this patient may be quite representative as nearly one half of documented cases have been noted to harbor multiple aneurysms, and posterior circulation involvement appears to be common. These anatomic features may relate to the pathophysiology of arterial destruction common in sickle cell disease.
