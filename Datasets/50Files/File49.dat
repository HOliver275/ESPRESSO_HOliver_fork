Effects of urokinase receptor occupancy on plasmin generation and proteolysis of basement membrane by human tumor cells. The goal of the present study was to assess the relative importance of receptor-bound and secreted plasminogen activator urokinase (u-PA) in generating cell-surface plasmin and fostering destruction of normal tissue by tumor cells. We first showed that active site-inhibited u-PA could displace endogenous u-PA from the surface of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT 116. We then prepared expression vectors for u-PA and for a mutant molecule in which the codon for the active site serine residue was changed to encode alanine. Expression of non-functional mutant u-PA decreased the level of cell-bound active u-PA by more than 95% via a mechanism that involved competition for receptor sites. Decreased cell-surface u-PA activity was associated with a decrease in cell-bound plasmin activity to undetectable levels, suggesting that receptor-bound u-PA plays an important role in the generation of plasmin on the cell surface. Transfectants that secreted eightfold to 20-fold elevated levels of active wild-type u-PA showed approximately 50% increases in cell-associated u-PA and only twofold to fourfold increases in cell-associated plasmin, suggesting that the role of secreted u-PA in generating cell-surface plasmin activity was relatively minor. In parent cells and both types of transfectants there was a good correlation between the amount of plasmin bound to the tumor cell surface and the extent to which a basement membrane substrate was degraded. These studies show that receptor-bound u-PA provides an efficient mechanism for plasmin generation on the surface of tumor cells, which, in turn, contributes significantly to their degradative potential. 
Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Isradipine twice daily lowers blood pressure over 24 H. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of isradipine and placebo on blood pressure (BP) at the end of the dosing interval ('trough'). Following a three-week placebo period, 187 patients who had previously shown a response to treatment with isradipine (based on office BP measurements) were randomized to double-blind treatment with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily or placebo for six weeks. Four of these patients withdrew from the study during the double-blind phase because of adverse events (one taking isradipine and three taking placebo). Blood pressure during the double-blind study was always measured 12 h after drug administration (trough values). The rate of normalization [defined as diastolic BP (DBP) less than or equal to 90 mm Hg] was 52/96 (54%) in the isradipine-treated group compared with 30/87 (33%) in the placebo group. A further 12/96 (12%) patients taking isradipine showed a fall in DBP of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, although their DBP was still not less than 90 mm Hg, compared with 5/87 (6%) patients receiving placebo. This difference was statistically significant (P = .003). Thus, isradipine in a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure over 24 h. 
Chimeric BCR-abl messenger RNA as a marker for minimal residual disease in patients transplanted for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We correlated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable BCR-abl fusion transcripts with cytogenetic status in 24 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Of 10 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients, only one was found to exhibit a BCR-abl fusion transcript. Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL. 
The "make/break test" as a diagnostic tool in functional weakness. Strength was measured in four major muscle groups with a hand-held dynamometer. The "make" and "break" technique was used with and without encouragement, and fatiguability was tested in patients with organic weakness and patients with functional weakness. Patients with functional weakness could be distinguished from the other two groups by an increase in strength greater than 20% with the break compared with the make technique. Additionally they tend to show larger increases in strength with encouragement and their "fatiguability" was less. 
Localized recurrent postoperative pernio associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A patient with recurrent pernio of the right ankle for 21 years after surgery had a leukocytoclastic vasculitis localized in the area. We suggest that the various histologic descriptions of pernio in the literature and in this case represent different levels of severity of the disease. 
Early hepatocellular carcinoma: MR imaging. All areas in hepatic lesions designated as adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) with malignant foci have recently been recognized as cancer. AH with malignant foci can be classified into two types, depending on the presence of overt cancerous nodules. Lesions without macroscopic nodules are defined as early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while those with a macroscopic component are defined as HCC with early components. A comparative study of early HCC and HCC with early components was performed with magnetic resonance imaging. Early HCC lesions (n = 20) were isointense (n = 11) and hyperintense (n = 9) on T1-weighted spin-echo images and isointense (n = 17), partially hyperintense (n = 2), or hypointense (n = 1) on T2-weighted spin-echo images relative to the surrounding liver. Lesions classified as HCC with early components (n = 8) were hyperintense (n = 5), isointense (n = 2), and of mixed signal intensity (n = 1) on T2-weighted images. T1-weighted imaging was superior to T2-weighted imaging in depicting early HCC, but the latter could be useful in evaluating the progression of HCC in the histopathologically early stages. 
Heart disease in blacks of Africa and the Caribbean. Cardiovascular pathology in African and Afro-Caribbean blacks features three major conditions: hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and the cardiomyopathies. Ischemic heart disease is as yet distinctly uncommon in these societies but the adoption of Western lifestyle and its inevitable risk factors for atherosclerosis makes it likely that coronary artery disease will emerge ultimately. Hypertension poses special problems in these regions--its prevalence rate is high both in rural and urban settings, its consequences devastating in its severity of target organ involvement, and its management strategy complicated by the high cost of drugs, poor patient compliance, and the lack of clinical resources for effective monitoring of detected and referred cases. Rheumatic heart disease remains an eminently preventable condition. The ultimate strategy lies in improving the quality of life in these communities through adequate housing, sanitation, and health education, and integrating primary prophylaxis into national health care programs to forestall the development of rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy poses the greatest challenge as its etiology remains elusive. Its dilated form has been linked with Toxoplasma and with Coxsackie B viruses, but hard evidence of a cause-effect relationship is still lacking. 
Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. 
Outcome after emergency surgery for cancer of the large intestine. The data for 77 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction (57 patients) or perforation (20 patients) within 24 h of admission were evaluated. The patients were older and had more advanced disease than patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation. 
Serial gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans in patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical trials and natural history. Six patients with early, mild, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were studied with monthly gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans for 8 to 11 months. Numerous enhancing lesions were observed irrespective of clinical activity. Four of the 6 patients had one or more enhancing lesions present on each examination. The other 2 patients had enhancing lesions noted in 7 and 9 of 11 months. In contrast, only two clinical exacerbations were observed during the study period. Neither the exacerbations nor other changes in symptoms or signs correlated with occurrence of the enhancing lesions. Enhancement generally persisted for less than 1 month. The opening of the blood-brain barrier as reflected by gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging may represent ongoing disease activity in patients with mild, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who are clinically stable. The frequency of these lesions appears to be sufficient to use as an outcome measure in clinical trials testing clinical efficacy in patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Diagnostic sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization for the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in biopsy specimens from cervical lesions. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with benign and malignant neoplasms of the cervix. One of the criteria for their etiologic role requires an assessment of whether virtually all or only a small fraction of lesions contain viral genomes. DNA preparations from colposcopically directed punch biopsies of cervical lesions were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HPV DNA. The biopsy specimens represented different pathologic entities (koilocytosis, condyloma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive carcinoma). In Southern blot hybridization with radioactive probes for HPV 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33, HPV DNA was detected in 74% of the biopsy specimens (42 of 57 cases), with the predominant types being HPV 16 and HPV 18. In contrast, after PCR amplification with primers yielding fragments of characteristic size for HPV 11, 16, and 18, the analysis of the same 57 biopsy specimens revealed that all samples were positive for at least one HPV type. To exclude false-positive PCR results, controls without HPV DNA were interspersed at regular intervals, and results were evaluated only if these controls remained HPV negative. To exclude false-negative results due to failure of the reaction, a target sequence within the c-Ha-ras-1 gene was used as an internal control. All HPV typing results obtained by Southern blot hybridization were in agreement with HPV typing by PCR. The higher number of positive samples in the latter analysis stems from the increased sensitivity of PCR, which was which was effective in identifying as few as 10-100 HPV DNA molecules; in contrast, the sensitivity of Southern blot hybridization was 1 pg, or approximately 10(5) molecules of HPV DNA. The authors conclude that, with sufficiently sensitive diagnostic methods, HPV DNA can be detected in most, if not all, neoplastic cervical lesions. 
bcl-1 rearrangement. Frequency and clinical significance among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The authors investigated the structural organization of the bcl-1 locus, a putative oncogene associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(11;14), by Southern blot hybridization analysis and its frequency, distribution, and prognostic significance in a panel of 156 clinically and pathologically well-defined B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The authors detected bcl-1 rearrangements in only 2 of 42 CLLs and 4 of 114 NHLs, specifically 3 of 29 diffuse small lymphocytic and 1 of 10 diffuse small cleaved cell and none of 5 diffuse intermediate lymphocytic, 13 follicular predominantly small cleaved, 17 follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell, 4 diffuse mixed small and large cell, 26 diffuse large cell, and 10 diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas. None of seven cases of Rai stage III or IV CLL or seven diffuse large cell lymphomas occurring as Richter's syndrome exhibited bcl-1 rearrangements. In conclusion, the bcl-1 locus rearranges in only about 4% of B-cell CLLs and NHLs, is predominantly rearranged in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, and does not appear to be preferentially associated with those occasional CLLs and low-grade NHLs displaying clinical aggressiveness, advanced clinical stage, or large cell transformation (Richter's syndrome). Therefore the demonstration of bcl-1 rearrangement does not appear to have clinically useful prognostic significance. 
Modifications of the nasal cycle in patients with hypothalamic disorders: Kallmann's syndrome. The nasal cycle is a phenomenon characterized by cyclic changes in the airflow resistance of each nasal fossa from congestion or constriction of the nasal erectile tissue. This phenomenon is caused by alterations in the influence exerted by the autonomic nervous system and is believed to be regulated by a hypothalamic center. In order to verify this hypothesis on the hypothalamic regulation of the nasal cycle, the authors studied a group of subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia. An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy. 
Abdominal musculature abnormalities as a cause of groin pain in athletes. Inguinal hernias and pubalgia. There has been increasing interest within the European sports medicine community regarding the etiology and treatment of groin pain in the athlete. Groin pain is most commonly caused by musculotendinous strains of the adductors and other muscles crossing the hip joint, but may also be related to abdominal wall abnormalities. Cases may be termed "pubalgia" if physical examination does not reveal inguinal hernia and there is an absence of other etiology for groin pain. We present nine cases of patients who underwent herniorrhaphies for groin pain. Two patients had groin pain without evidence of a hernia preoperatively (pubalgia). In the remaining seven patients we determined the presence of a hernia by physical examination. At operation, eight patients were found to have inguinal hernias. One patient had no hernia but had partial avulsion of the internal oblique fibers from their insertion at the public tubercle. The average interval from operation to return to full activity was 11 weeks. All patients returned to full activity within 3 months of surgery. One patient had persistent symptoms of mild incisional tenderness, but otherwise there were no recurrences, complications, or persistence of symptoms. Abnormalities of the abdominal wall, including inguinal hernias and microscopic tears or avulsions of the internal oblique muscle, can be an overlooked source of groin pain in the athlete. Operative treatment of this condition with herniorrhaphy can return the athlete to his sport within 3 months. 
The influence of smoking on complications after primary amputations of the lower extremity. A total of 165 primary above-the-knee (AK) and below-the-knee (BK) amputations in 137 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 77 patients who smoked, 44 smoked cigarettes, 30 cheroots, and three a pipe. There were 88 nonsmokers. At the time of surgery, the smokers were on average 6.4 years younger than the nonsmokers. The review revealed no discrepancy between smokers and nonsmokers with regard to amputation level, the BK to AK ratio being 2:1. In cigarette smokers the risk of infection and reamputation was 2:5 times higher than in cheroot smokers or nonsmokers. The poor results obtained in cigarette smokers may be ascribed to the fact that this group of patients smoked during the phase of healing and that only cigarette smokers tend to inhale. Inhalation of smoke leads to high concentrations of nicotine, which compromise the cutaneous blood-flow velocity and increase the risk of the formation of microthrombi. Consequently, amputees should abstain from cigarette smoking during the phase of healing. Preferably, the habit should be broken one week before surgery, which is the requisite period for the process of coagulation and the fibrinogen level to normalize and for free radicals to be eliminated. 
Surgical management of metastatic renal carcinoma of the spine. A total of 33 patients with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the spine underwent spinal decompression over a 5-year period; 20 were operated on for neurologic dysfunction, and the remainder for pain alone. Surgery was performed anteriorly in 21, posteriorly in 9, and combined in 3 cases. The surgical approach was determined by the preoperative anatomic localization of the tumor. Of these patients 88% had fusions with instrumentation and polymethylmethacrylate; 88% of patients had partial or complete relief of pain; and 64% of bedridden patients subsequently were able to walk. Neurologic function improved in 60% of patients with a neurologic deficit; however, only 36% of incontinent patients regained bladder control. Survival averaged 8.0 +/- 1.5 months. Survival correlated with the degree of neurologic dysfunction and the presence of other known metastases. Recurrent cord compression developed in 49% of patients, usually at the same level; 9 of these 16 patients had repeat decompression, with similar operative results as the primary procedure in terms of pain and neurologic function. Blood loss was variable but often significant. Preoperative embolization appeared to be beneficial. Precise tumor localization preoperatively directing the surgical approach and better patient selection would likely improve results and decrease morbidity. Good palliation appeared to be achieved in regards to both pain relief and improved neurologic function. 
Identification of colon cancer-predisposed individuals: a cytogenetic analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 23 individuals with polyps and 10 age-matched controls were cytogenetically studied. Of 23 individuals with polyps, 13 were males and 10 females. The age distribution of these patients was between 22 and 84 yr, with a medium age of 49.6 yr. Chromosome 5 was involved in structural rearrangements in 10 of the 18 patients with adenomatous polyps (55.5%). All those who showed involvement of chromosome 5 alterations had either adenomatous polyps or Gardner's syndrome, and two had colon adenocarcinoma. Of the remainder who did not show involvement of chromosome 5, eight had adenomatous polyps and five had hyerplastic polyps (non-neoplastic). Of the 10 control samples, only one showed alteration of chromosome 5. Of the 10 adenomatous polyp subjects that showed chromosome 5 defects, two had translocations of chromosome 5 and the short arm of 17. Chromosome 5 was broken 13 times (5 times in the q arm and 8 times in the p arm). Based on our present cytogenetic data, we tentatively conclude that lymphocyte metaphases may be used to identify colon cancer-predisposed individuals. 
Attenuation of myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion by ultrashort-acting beta adrenergic blockade. To assess the effect of the ultrashort-acting beta blocker esmolol on ischemia induced by acute coronary occlusion, we studied 16 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Doppler echocardiography and ECG monitoring were performed continuously before, during, and after balloon occlusion in the drug-free state and during esmolol infusion. Fourteen of the 16 patients had ST segment elevation during balloon inflation. However, maximal ST segment elevation (2.1 +/- 1.5 mm vs 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, p less than 0.001) and duration of ST segment elevation (68 +/- 20 seconds vs 54 +/- 19 seconds, p less than 0.05) were both significantly reduced during esmolol infusion. Furthermore, the decrease in ejection fraction seen during drug-free balloon occlusions was significantly blunted during esmolol infusion. In the baseline state ejection fraction decreased from 55% to 38% (p less than 0.05) during coronary occlusion compared with a decrease from 52% to 49% (p = NS) during esmolol infusion. In addition, esmolol appeared to delay the onset of segmental wall motion abnormalities after coronary occlusion, occurring at a mean of 40 seconds after balloon inflation versus a mean of 31 seconds in the absence of beta blockade (p less than 0.05). Thus the use of ultrashort-acting beta blockade appears to diminish the extent and delay the onset of myocardial ischemia during acute coronary occlusion. 
Uterine leiomyoma with skeletal muscle differentiation. Report of a case. Skeletal muscle differentiation is reported in a uterine leiomyoma from a 54-year-old woman. Evidence of rhabdomyoblastic features included a typical light microscopic appearance, immunoreactivity with antimyoglobin antibodies by immunoperoxidase studies, and the presence of myofibrils by electron microscopic examination. The patient is well more than two years after surgery. 
Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy with intravenous etidronate. A controlled, multicenter study. The Hypercalcemia Study Group In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, 202 patients with cancer from 19 medical centers were treated for hypercalcemia of malignancy with daily intravenous infusions of etidronate disodium (136 patients) or saline alone (66 patients) for 3 consecutive days. Patients also received up to 3.25 L of saline daily during the treatment period. Of 157 patients for whom data could be evaluated for efficacy, 63% (72/114) of etidronate-treated and 33% (14/43) of saline-treated patients had a normalization of total serum calcium levels. When serum calcium levels were adjusted for albumin (147 assessable patients), 24% of the etidronate- and 7% of the saline-treated patients responded to treatment. No serious side effects or treatment-related deaths occurred. When accompanied by adequate hydration and diuresis, intravenous etidronate was safe and more effective than hydration and diuresis alone in controlling hypercalcemia of malignancy. 
The efficacy of fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy in the detection of early nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy of the nasopharynx was done in 130 patients as a prospective study. They all had elevated titers of antibodies against the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus but no symptoms or signs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Each underwent a biopsy from six fixed sites in the nasopharynx. Of the 780 biopsy specimens taken from seven patients, 11 showed the presence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Techniques to improve the yields of such biopsies with fiberoptic endoscopy are discussed. The presence of tumor was unrelated to the macroscopic endoscopic findings. The highest incidence of subclinical tumor is in the pharyngeal recess. 
Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of superior vena cava: a rare cause of the superior vena cava syndrome. The superior vena cava syndrome associated with an intraluminal vascular proliferative lesion is extremely rare. A case of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of the superior vena cava causing obstructive symptoms is reported that was successfully managed by surgical excision. 
Different metastasis patterns of a human melanoma cell line in nude mice and rats: influence of microenvironment. The metastatic capacity of intravenously injected human FEMX-I melanoma cells in athymic nude mice and rats was compared. Young rats given 1 x 10(6) ascites tumor cells all died of lung tumors with a life span of 50 +/- 10 days (mean +/- SD). In contrast, in accordance with previous findings, only extrapulmonary metastases developed in mice. This host-dependent difference in metastasis pattern permitted studies on the role of factors that may influence the organ specificity of metastases. The tissue distribution of 125I-labeled FEMX-I cells did not differ in the two nude species during the first 12 hours after cell injection. The plating efficiency of FEMX-I cells in soft agar was increased by the addition of conditioned medium prepared from rat lungs, resulting also in a significant increase in colony size. In contrast, conditioned medium prepared from mouse lungs reduced the clonogenic capacity of the FEMX-I cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conditioned media prepared from rat and mouse liver, kidney, and spleen tissues either inhibited or had no effect on colony formation. The results suggest that the unexpected differential metastatic patterns observed in vivo may reflect differences in the presence of growth-modulating paracrine factors in the host lungs. 
Body weight is more important than family history of hypertension for left ventricular function. Left ventricular function was studied in young men with a positive family history of hypertension for two generations (n = 15). The findings were compared with three control groups: one age-, sex-, and weight-matched group with a negative family history of hypertension (n = 14); one normotensive control group unselected as regards family history of hypertension (n = 27); and one group also unselected regarding family history of hypertension but selected with blood pressure criteria to have mild blood pressure elevation (n = 59). The group with a positive family history of hypertension, in comparison with the normotensive control group, was heavier, had higher blood pressure, increased left ventricular wall thickness, increased left ventricular mass, and signs of changes in diastolic and systolic left ventricular function. There were no differences in these variables between the group with a positive family history and the other two control groups. Data clearly indicated that subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, as well as subjects with mild blood pressure elevation, were heavier than the normotensive control group. It is not possible to judge, with available data, if the changes in left ventricular morphology and function in the two groups with a different family history of hypertension and in the group with mild blood pressure elevation occurred as a physiological response to the increase in afterload or if the neurohormonal and metabolic disturbances leading to the condition of slight overweight also affected left ventricular function. 
Noninvasive identification of significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery by dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy. To evaluate the usefulness of dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy with low-level exercise for the identification of left main (LM) coronary artery disease (CAD), 466 consecutive patients with CAD were studied. Thirty-eight patients (8%) had LM stenosis (diameter narrowing greater than or equal to 50%). The LM scintigraphic pattern was present in 9 of 38 patients with LMCAD and 38 of 428 CAD patients without LMCAD (24 vs 9%; p less than 0.005). This pattern was present in 6 of 9 patients with LMCAD without right CAD and in only 3 of 29 patients with LM and right CAD (67 vs 10%; p = 0.0005). Patients with LMCAD had a higher incidence of premature cessation of low-level exercise (53 vs 21%; p less than 0.0001), chest pain (68 vs 48%; p less than 0.02), blood pressure decrease of greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg (44 vs 16%; p less than 0.002) and greater ST depression (0.17 +/- 0.13 vs 0.06 +/- 0.10 mV; p less than 0.001) during dipyridamole loading than patients without LMCAD. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that the LM scintigraphic pattern and markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LMCAD without right CAD (sensitivity 67%, specificity 91%), but this predictability is no better than the LM scintigraphic pattern alone. The combination of clinical markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading and scintigraphic findings of diffuse slow washout, extensive fixed defects and the LM pattern best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LM and right CAD (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%). 
Ankle arthrodesis in children. The indications, surgical technique, and long-term functional results for ankle arthrodesis differ between children and adults. In children, the reasons for performing a tibiotalar fusion include pain, most commonly from traumatic and septic arthritis, and instability from congenital anomalies or paralytic disorders. The most appropriate procedure is Chuinard's fusion, which achieves a tibiotalar fusion without causing a growth arrest of the distal tibial growth plate. In the long term, young patients with ankle arthrodesis function very well with minimal pain or disability. Stressful activities such as hill climbing, stair climbing, and running may be restricted or require compensatory movements. 
Receptor function in heart failure. In patients with congestive heart failure, down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors is present, probably as a result of sympathetic overstimulation. In end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-adrenoceptor density is markedly reduced, while beta 2-adrenoceptor density is normal. This latter finding does not necessarily imply normal sensitivity to beta 2-stimulation, due to possible alterations in the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylate cyclase complex beyond the receptor. In some disease states, such as ischemic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve disease, there seems to be a concomitant reduction of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. The finding of beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation has stimulated the search for novel therapeutic approaches in heart failure patients. Beta-agonists could even further down-regulate beta receptors, and this perhaps explains why they seem not to be useful in long-term use. Agents that directly stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, such as forskolin, or that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate degradation, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are being tested. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were used in treatment of heart failure before beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation was recognized in these patients. It is tempting to speculate that the beneficial clinical and hemodynamic effects seen in these patients treated with metoprolol is indeed due to an antagonism of the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation. Studies testing whether beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents can improve survival in congestive heart failure patients are on-going. 
An unknown syndrome of nose deformity, oxycephaly, aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts, and symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip in siblings: craniorhiny. An unknown syndrome of oxycephaly, nose deformity, hair growth on the skin at the base of the nose, symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip, and aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts in a mother and her three children is presented. This syndrome showed autosomal dominant inheritance. All three children were operated on. Oxycephaly and lip deformity in two of the children and hypertelorism that existed in addition to the other anomalies in the third were all corrected. All corrective surgery was performed during a single session for each child. 
Thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction: assessment of efficacy by myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi has been used to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy. Improved image quality due to the higher photon energy of Tc-99m and the increased allowable doses of this radiopharmaceutical along with its lack of redistribution makes Tc-99m sestamibi an acceptable imaging agent for such studies. This imaging agent was used for serial quantitative planar and tomographic imaging to assess the initial risk area of infarction, its change over time and the relation to infarct-related artery patency in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-three of 30 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 hours after onset of acute chest pain. Seven patients were treated in the conventional manner and did not receive thrombolytic therapy. The initial area at risk varied greatly both in patients treated with rt-PA and in those who received conventional therapy. Patients with successful thrombolysis and patient infarct arteries had a significantly greater reduction of Tc-99m sestamibi defect size than patients who had persistent coronary occlusion. Serial imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi could find important application in future clinical research evaluating the efficacy of new thrombolytic agents. Direct measurements of the amount of hypoperfused myocardium before and after thrombolysis could provide rapid and unequivocal results using fewer patients and avoiding the use of "mortality" as an end point. This approach has not yet been widely tested in the clinical arena. 
Increase in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome--United States, 1988-1990. In 1988, health departments in the United States reported an all-time low of 225 cases of rubella. However, in 1989, the number of reported cases increased nearly twofold, and in 1990, an additional threefold. As of January 4, 1991, a provisional total of 1093 cases (0.4 cases per 100,000 population) had been reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) for 1990--the highest total since 1982 (Figure 1). This report summarizes the increase in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) since 1988. 
Fanconi's anaemia and post-cricoid carcinoma. A case of post-cricoid carcinoma, occurring in a patient with Fanconi's anaemia is presented. The case illustrates the rare association of the two diseases. The problems with the management of such a case are discussed. 
Cesarean section by local anesthesia in patients with familial dysautonomia. We describe a 29-year-old patient with familial dysautonomia who underwent cesarean section because of severe intrauterine fetal growth retardation. The surgery was done after induction of local anesthesia to avoid the critical and sometimes fatal complications of general anesthesia known in patients with familial dysautonomia. Surgery was uneventful and almost painless. The postoperative period was without complications. Induction of local anesthesia for cesarean section may constitute a suitable alternative in patients with familial dysautonomia. 
Positive role of Clostridium difficile infection in diarrhea in infants and children. A retrospective review of children with Clostridium difficile infection and diarrhea identified 43 patients. Fifteen (35%) had immunoglobulins below the normal range for age, and typified those with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, because all increased their levels over the following 12 months. The age of those with hypogammaglobulinemia was significantly younger (p less than 0.01), averaging 18.8 months, than those with normal immunoglobulins who had a mean age of 4.6 yr. The number with recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the hypogammaglobulinemic group than in those with normal immunoglobulins (46% vs 18%). Eleven children were identified who had C. difficile toxin in the stool after antibiotic therapy, but who had no diarrhea at the time of study. All had normal immunoglobulins. Control patients (20 without and 40 with diarrhea) had no evidence of C. difficile infection, and all but three had normal immunoglobulins. Three (7%) of those with diarrhea had IgA deficiency, and all had a diagnosis of milk protein allergy. These data suggest that immunoglobulin values be obtained in infants and children who have problematic C. difficile diarrhea in order to identify disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis which may be the underlying cause of repeated upper respiratory disease requiring antibiotic usage. 
Are CT scans for head injury patients always necessary? The study reported here sought to identify a group of adult head injury patients in whom computerized axial tomographic (CT) scans were not necessary. The study was limited to patients 18 years of age and older with a history of minor head injury who remained neurologically stable for 20 minutes after arrival at the trauma center, maintained a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 13, and had no clinical evidence of basal skull fracture. These patients had a uniformly good neurologic prognosis. The CT scan did not have any prognostic or therapeutic implications. Of a total of 348 patients studied, 12 had an abnormal CT scan with no neurologic deficits or sequelae, and all of them had an uneventful hospital discharge without readmission. It appears that a routine CT scan for minimal head injury patients is an inefficient use of personnel and equipment which may add to the ever increasing financial burden on trauma centers. 
Tocainide therapy in muscle cramps and spasms due to neuromuscular disease. Significant improvement in symptoms of disabling cramps and muscle spasms was obtained in 9 patients with motor neuron diseases, tetany, and myotonic disorders who were treated with tocainide, a lidocaine analog. No significant side effects were observed except for light-headedness and fatigue in 1 patient, who also showed slight prolongation of intraventricular conduction time. Tocainide is useful in treating disabling muscle spasms and cramps associated with conditions characterized by neuromuscular irritability. This effect is probably based on stabilization of the membrane potential at various levels (motor neurons, peripheral nerve, or muscle fiber membrane). 
The relationship of cocaine to headache in polysubstance abusers. In a questionnaire survey of inpatient polysubstance abusers it was found that cocaine relieved migraine-type headaches much more often in chronic headache sufferers than in those with only occasional headaches (p less than .05). However, cocaine could also bring on headaches after several hours, both in chronic headache sufferers and in those not subject to headaches. The facts that cocaine may relieve headache immediately, and also may precipitate headaches several hours after use, suggests that the well-known vasoconstrictive actions of cocaine may be responsible. Migraineurs seem more susceptible to some of these effects of cocaine than are people without chronic headaches. 
Comparison of the ramp versus standard exercise protocols. To compare the hemodynamic and gas exchange responses of ramp treadmill and cycle ergometer tests with standard exercise protocols used clinically, 10 patients with chronic heart failure, 10 with coronary artery disease who were asymptomatic during exercise, 11 with coronary artery disease who were limited by angina during exercise and 10 age-matched normal subjects performed maximal exercise using six different exercise protocols. Gas exchange data were collected continuously during each of the following protocols, performed on separate days in randomized order: Bruce, Balke and an individualized ramp treadmill; 25 W/stage, 50 W/stage and an individualized ramp cycle ergometer test. Maximal oxygen uptake was 16% greater on the treadmill protocols combined (21.4 +/- 8 ml/kg per min) versus the cycle ergometer protocols combined (18.1 +/- 7 ml/kg per min) (p less than 0.01), although no differences were observed in maximal heart rate (131 +/- 24 versus 126 +/- 24 beats/min for the treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols, respectively). No major differences were observed in maximal heart rate or maximal oxygen uptake among the various treadmill protocols or among the various cycle ergometer protocols. The ratio of oxygen uptake to work rate, expressed as a slope, was highest for the ramp tests (slope +/- SEE ml/kg per min = 0.80 +/- 2.5 and 0.78 +/- 1.7 for ramp treadmill and ramp cycle ergometer, respectively). The slopes were poorest for the tests with the largest increments in work (0.62 +/- 4.0 and 0.59 +/- 2.8 for the Bruce treadmill and 50 W/stage cycle ergometer, respectively). 
Complete temporal lobectomy for surgical resuscitation of patients with transtentorial herniation secondary to unilateral hemispheric swelling. Transtentorial herniation is an ominous finding in the patient with head injuries. We report our experience with 10 patients suffering from acute transtentorial herniation secondary to posttraumatic unilateral hemispheric swelling who were treated aggressively with temporal lobectomy. Eight patients were men and 2 were women. Their ages ranged from 22 to 61 years, with a mean of 37 years. Their preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranged from 3 to 6, with a mean of 4. All patients had both computed tomographic and clinical evidence of unilateral hemispheric shift and acute herniation without a significant subdural or epidural hematoma. Seven patients had unilateral nonreactive pupils and 3 had bilateral nonreactive pupils. All were taken to the operating room within 2 hours of clinical signs of herniation. Complete unilateral temporal lobectomies including the mesial structures, amygdala, and uncus were performed. In this series, the mortality rate was 30%, including a single patient who was neurologically stable but died from nonneurological injuries. Of the 7 survivors, 4 were functionally independent and 3 required minimal assistance with the activities of daily living. Aggressive, early decompression via complete temporal lobectomy may thus significantly improve the outcome in patients with transtentorial herniation accompanying posttraumatic hemispheric swelling and midline shift. 
Localization of urokinase-type plasminogen activator in stromal cells in adenocarcinomas of the colon in humans. Human colon adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal colon tissues were stained immunohistochemically with three different monoclonal antibodies and one preparation of polyclonal antibodies against each of the two plasminogen activators, uPA (urokinase type) and tPA (tissue type). The staining patterns seen with the respective sets of antibodies were identical. In all of 10 cases, staining for uPA in the normal colon tissue was confined to scattered fibroblastlike cells in the lamina propria. Other cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, were uPA negative. All the tumor infiltrates contained many more uPA-positive cells than the normal tissues, but the staining was confined to fibroblastlike cells and endothelial cells in the tumor stroma, while no staining of the malignant epithelial cells was detected. Analysis for uPA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in four cases showed an average uPA content of 0.15 ng uPA/mg protein in the normal colon tissues and 1.6 ng uPA/mg protein in the tumors. Tissue-type plasminogen activator immunoreactivity was confined to endothelial cells in both the normal colon tissue and in the colon carcinomas. These findings may indicate that colon cancer cells recruit stromal cells to produce uPA involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix during invasive growth. 
Hemodynamically stable upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This article is a prospective evaluation of 38 patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with hematemesis but who were otherwise hemodynamically stable. Four patients were admitted, only one because of the development of hemodynamic instability. Thirty-three patients were discharged; on follow-up there was no evidence of major morbidity or mortality. Two patients were lost to follow-up, one who left against medical advice and one who lived in a county outside the service area of our hospital. Patients with hematemesis can be safely discharged from the ED after observation for 6 hours if they: (1) lack orthostatic vital sign changes; (2) lack associated significant underlying disease; (3) have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 10 gm/dL; (4) are less than 60 years of age; and (5) are thought to be reliable and compliant. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific intravenous immunoglobulin for the prevention of primary CMV infection and disease after marrow transplant. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific immunoglobulin (IVIG) was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in CMV-seronegative marrow transplant patients with seropositive marrow donors for the prevention of primary CMV infection during the first 100 days after transplant. Patients received 200 mg/kg CMV IVIG on days 8 and 6 before transplant, the day after transplant, weekly for the first month, and then every 2 weeks to complete 10 doses. Patients were followed with weekly CMV cultures and serologic studies and for clinical and histologic evidence of CMV disease. Sixty patients were evaluable in each group. There was significantly less CMV excretion (P = .04) and viremia (P = .01) in the treatment group. However, the incidence of CMV disease including CMV pneumonia, CMV enteritis, and CMV syndrome (fever, leukopenia, hepatitis) was not statistically different. There was also no difference in median time of onset of CMV infection or disease, median number of hospital days, or survival between the two groups. 
Surgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result? Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique. 
Nonlymphoblastic lymphoma in children--histology and stage-related response to therapy: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. From May 1979 to March 1983, 93 eligible patients with nonlymphoblastic lymphoma (NLBL) were treated by members of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) with Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and mercaptopurine (ACOP+); CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cranial irradiation (2,400 rads), and radiation therapy to the primary disease were administered in stages I and II, and to residual disease in stages III and IV. Duration of treatment was 2 years for stages I, II, and III and 3 years for stage IV disease. Of the 93 patients entered onto the study, 47 had diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma (DSNCL), 38 had diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), and eight had other histologies. Localized disease (stages I and II) was present in 51 patients, and 42 had advanced (stages III and IV) disease. The study confirmed previously reported importance of stage with a 4-year event-free survival (EFS) of 78% (SE +/- 7%) for patients with localized disease as compared with 44% (SE +/- 9%) in patients with advanced disease (P less than or equal to .001). In localized disease, seven of 11 adverse events occurred in patients who were off therapy and more than 30 months after the initial diagnosis (relapse, three; second malignancy, two; death in remission, two). Large-cell histology proved to be an important prognostic factor in patients with stages III and IV disease with EFS at 4 years of 67% (SE +/- 11%) for DLCL versus 17% (SE +/- 11%) for DSNCL (P less than or equal to .001). We conclude that it is important to distinguish histologically between small noncleaved-cell and large-cell types of NLBL as a basis for further controlled clinical trials. 
National surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Acute appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma. Incidence or coincidence? Inflammation of the appendix is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well described. The initiating factor often is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by inspissated stool, barium, food, parasites, or hyperplastic lymphoid tissue. Two patients have been identified who developed appendicitis temporally related to blunt abdominal trauma, without other clear etiology. Although absolute documentation of trauma as an etiologic factor in these cases is difficult, theoretical mechanisms for the occurrence are discussed. In the setting of right lower quadrant pain following mild to moderate blunt abdominal trauma, acute appendicitis should be considered as a possibility. 
Limited efficacy of leukopoor platelets for prevention of febrile transfusion reactions. Leukopoor red cell components have a reduced incidence of febrile transfusion reactions. An analogous efficacy for leukopoor platelets has not been convincingly established. The authors analyzed the transfusion records of 36 patients (26 women, 10 men) who received leukopoor platelets following febrile reactions to unmodified platelets. These patients received 409 unmodified transfusions (mean/patient 11) with 84 febrile reactions (rate 20.5%). Reaction rates to unmodified, non-HLA-matched single donor platelets (14.0%) and HLA-matched platelets (6.5%) were significantly lower than to pooled concentrates (27.2%) (P less than .01 and P less than .001, respectively). Of 623 leukopoor transfusions (mean/patient 17), 84 resulted in reactions (13.5%). Although leukodepletion significantly lowered the overall reaction rate as compared with unmodified products (P less than .02), a majority of patients (28 of 36) continued to have reactions. When individual reaction rates to unmodified and leukopoor transfusions were compared, only two patients showed a significant decrease in their reaction rate with leukopoor platelets. It appears that most susceptible patients continue to react to leukopoor platelets, particularly when pooled concentrates are used, and many patients show no reduction in reaction rate. 
Ryanodine contracture: a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for malignant hyperthermia. In vitro contracture tests used currently for malignant hyperthermia (MH) do not possess absolute specificity. This is potentially a great problem in the study of the genetic approach which offers the best prospect for the development of a non-invasive diagnostic test for the condition. The calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been proposed as the site of the MH defect. Ryanodine, which binds avidly to this channel, was shown to differentiate between muscle of MH susceptible and normal patients in terms of in vitro contracture response. This ryanodine contracture response is proposed as a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for MH. 
Pharmacologically based dosing of etoposide: a means of safely increasing dose intensity. We have previously demonstrated that individualized dosing of etoposide (VP16) by 72-hour infusion is feasible and that the extent of leukopenia is a function of plasma concentration, pretreatment WBC (WBCp), albumin (ALB), performance status (PS), and bone marrow function (based on transfusion requirements). In the current study, 45 patients were randomized between a fixed dose of VP16 (125 mg/m2/d) versus individualized dosing to a target WBC nadir (WBCN) of 1,700/microL. The total dose was increased by an average of 22% in the latter patients (459 +/- 130 mg/m2 v 375 mg/m2, P = .002). This was associated with a decrease in both the mean WBCN (1,510 +/- 950 v 2,500 +/- 1,420/microL, P = .013) and in the variability of the WBCN (P = .039). The VP16 clearance (mL/min) was not correlated with body surface area. Partial responses were observed in one patient each with hepatoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We conclude that pharmacologically based dosing may be a means of increasing dose intensity without increasing the incidence of life-threatening toxicity due to a decrease in variability around a target WBC. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: Lutrepulse for injection. A multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the ability of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone to restore physiologic ovulatory function in women with diminished or absent pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. In 109 women with primary and secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Lutrepulse [gonadorelin acetate] for Injection) was extremely effective, resulting in ovulation in 91% and 96% of patients, respectively. Overall complications of intravenous line placement ranged from 0% to 11% (mean = 7%). A 12% incidence of multiple pregnancy was noted, and a single case of ovarian hyperstimulation was reported in a woman who also received clomiphene citrate. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment appears to be of at least comparable efficacy to human menopausal gonadotropins, with the added benefit of reduced overall risks for the patient with hypothalamic amenorrhea. 
The danger of an ultra-early computed tomographic scan in a patient with an evolving acute epidural hematoma. A case of an acute traumatic epidural hematoma that developed after an ultra-early computed tomographic scan of the head is discussed. Serial neurological examinations in patients with head injuries are recommended. 
Epidemiology of encephalitis in children: a 20-year survey. Four hundred five children from the Helsinki area who were 1 month to 16 years old were treated for acute encephalitis at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, from January 1968 through December 1987. Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of "others," whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4- to 9-year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero- and respiratory viruses. 
Dietary calcium and blood pressure: modifying factors in specific populations. Epidemiologic findings continue to add to the body of evidence supporting a relationship between calcium intake and blood pressure. These findings also indicate that there is a threshold of the potential protective effect of adequate calcium intake, below which the risk of hypertension increases at a greater rate. The set point of this threshold, estimated at 700-800 mg/d, may be modified by a variety of factors including dietary patterns and components, lifestyle, and genetics. This may explain, at least in part, the heterogeneous response observed in dietary-intervention studies. In animal models of hypertension it was shown that greater amounts of calcium must be given to cause a blood pressure change comparable with that in normal animals, suggesting that in high-risk human populations in which calcium metabolism may be disordered, calcium intake may have to be increased to amounts greater than 700-800 mg/d to demonstrate the blood-pressure-lowering effect. Calcium intake at or above the currently recommended daily allowance of 800 mg could be of potential benefit to certain racial groups, individuals ingesting excessive alcohol, and pregnant women, all of whom generally consume low amounts of calcium and who are at higher risk of developing hypertension. 
Second occurrence of spinal epidural metastases. We reviewed records of 79 men with spinal epidural metastases diagnosed from July 1984 to July 1989, imaged by myelography or MRI, and treated with radiation therapy. Thirteen men (16%) had second epidural metastases. The mean time between lesions that developed within two vertebral bodies of a prior lesion was 2.8 months, compared with 15.2 months for lesions that were three or more vertebral bodies from a prior lesion. Some secondary spinal metastases occurring soon after the initial metastasis may represent regrowth of tumor at the border of the radiation port, suggesting that larger radiation ports be constructed for patients with lengthy expected survival times. 
Plasma chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines in pheochromocytoma patients. Plasma levels of chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines were analysed before, during and after surgery in seven patients with pheochromocytoma. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity of these plasma amines and peptides, and to investigate their peroperative fluctuations. Chromogranin A + B in plasma was increased preoperatively in all patients, showed no significant increase during surgery, and normalized postoperatively. Neuropeptide Y, which alone can induce hypertension, was present in high levels in plasma from three patients preoperatively, increased further in four patients during surgery, and was postoperatively low in all patients. Fractionated plasma catecholamines were increased in five patients before surgery, increased in all patients during tumour dissection, and normalized postoperatively. It may be concluded that plasma chromogranin A + B exhibited as high a sensitivity for pheochromocytoma as fractionated urinary catecholamines in the patients studied. 
An analysis of cerebral blood flow in acute closed-head injury using technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT and computed tomography. Technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine (HMPAO) SPECT and x-ray CT were compared in 15 patients with acute closed-head injury. There were 44 focal lesions in all. Fifteen (34%) lesions were seen on both x-ray and SPECT. Seventeen (39%) lesions were seen only on SPECT. Twelve (27%) of the lesions were seen on x-ray tomography only. Of the lesions seen on x-ray tomography but not on SPECT, two were subarachnoid hemorrhage, two were thin subdural hematomas, and eight were contusions. This study shows that SPECT can detect focal disturbances of cerebral blood flow that are not seen on x-ray tomography. It also suggests that there are two types of contusions: those with a decreased cerebral blood flow (i.e., detectable on SPECT) and those with a cerebral blood flow equal to that of the surrounding brain. 
Parasympathetic withdrawal is an integral component of autonomic imbalance in congestive heart failure: demonstration in human subjects and verification in a paced canine model of ventricular failure. Although enhanced sympathetic tone is a well recognized component of the autonomic profile characteristic of congestive heart failure, the contribution of parasympathetic withdrawal to this autonomic imbalance is less well described. The technique of spectral analysis of heart rate variability provides a dynamic map of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone and was thus used to define the nature of sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions in humans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and in a paced canine model of congestive heart failure. Humans with cardiomyopathy were found to have an augmentation of the sympathetically mediated low frequency area of the power density spectrum. Parasympathetic withdrawal was demonstrated by significant reductions in the parasympathetically mediated high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the ratio of high to low frequency areas (p less than 0.01). Administration of atropine to normal subjects resulted in a significant reduction in the high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the high/low frequency area ratio, both of which decreased within the range noted in patients with congestive heart failure. Administration of isoproterenol in normal subjects led to an augmentation of the low frequency area but to only a small decrease in the high/low frequency area ratio. Induction of congestive heart failure in a paced canine model resulted in alterations in the autonomic profile that resembled those seen in humans with ventricular failure. The prominent high frequency region of the spectrum at baseline, indicating a predominance of parasympathetic tone, was absent after the evolution of congestive heart failure, and there was a marked augmentation of the low frequency region of the spectrum. 
Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in right hepatectomy with the preoperative APACHE II score. Morbidity and mortality rates in 70 patients who underwent major liver resection for liver tumors (primary and metastatic) were determined and correlated with the preoperative APACHE II score. Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative APACHE II score: low (0 to 3), mid (4 to 7), and high (8 and above). A higher score was closely correlated with increased postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates. The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%. Age did not correlate with morbidity. It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age. As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group). Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points. The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery. 
Dietary fish oil blocks the microcirculatory manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in hamsters. Epidemiologic observations and experimental studies have demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fish oil on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we used the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle of awake hamsters. In control hamsters (n = 7), reperfusion after a 4-hr pressure-induced ischemia to the muscle tissue elicited the adhesion of fluorescently stained leukocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules, capillary obstruction, and the break-down of endothelial integrity. These microvascular manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury were significantly attenuated in animals (n = 7) when fed with a fish oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks prior to the experiments. In leukocyte total lipids, the fish oil diet resulted in a substantial displacement of arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent adhesion-promoting leukotriene (LT) B4, by fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid, the precursor of biologically less potent LTB5, emphasizing the mediator role of LTB4 in ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results suggest that the preservation of microvascular perfusion by dietary fish oil contributes to its protective effects on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
Comparison of effects of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular function in patients over with those under 60 years of age. This study examined the effect of age on left ventricular (LV) function, assessed by contrast ventriculography 3 weeks after a first acute myocardial infarction in 312 patients who received thrombolytic therapy within 4 hours of the onset of infarction and in 83 patients who received placebo. Streptokinase was given to 188 patients and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to 124. Patients were divided into 2 age groups: less than 60 years (n = 244) and greater than or equal to 60 years (n = 151). Thrombolytic therapy improved ejection fraction in both age groups: from 54 +/- 13 to 59 +/- 11% (p = 0.021) in the younger group and from 50 +/- 14 to 57 +/- 13% (p = 0.004) in the older group. Ejection fraction was identical in streptokinase- and rt-PA-treated patients. Multifactor analysis of variance revealed that younger age and thrombolytic therapy were independently associated with improved ejection fraction. Thrombolytic therapy also reduced end-systolic volume (p = 0.001) by 14 ml in the elderly and 9 ml in the younger group. Minor bleeding complications were more frequent in the elderly and 3 serious hemorrhages occurred in patients greater than or equal to 60 years. These findings reveal that thrombolysis improves LV function in all age groups studied. Because increasing age is independently associated with a lower ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy may confer greater benefits in older patients. 
Dose-related effects of isoflurane associated with low plasma concentrations of verapamil on global and regional function in normal and compromised canine myocardium. Global and regional myocardial functions were studied in seven open-chest dogs with constant low plasma concentrations of verapamil as increasing concentrations of isoflurane (0.75, 1, 1.5 MAC) were administered in the presence of normal myocardial perfusion and after application of critical constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In the presence of verapamil, increases in isoflurane concentrations caused dose-dependent myocardial depression both before and after critical coronary constriction. The systemic and coronary vasodilatation associated with high concentrations of isoflurane did not occur in the presence of verapamil. The association of verapamil with isoflurane caused regional myocardial dysfunction that worsened at high isoflurane concentrations. This regional dysfunction could not be antagonized in two dogs. The effects of isoflurane on regional function were not modified by application of a critical coronary constriction. 
Intermittent long-term adrenocorticosteroid treatment of myasthenia gravis. It is widely accepted that a long-term, alternate-day administration of adrenal corticosteroids after thymectomy is one of the most effective treatments of myasthenia gravis. However, some patients with myasthenia gravis show a tendency to develop steroid dependency, and require extremely prolonged administration of fairly high doses of steroids. Various types of adverse reactions to steroids are likely to occur in such cases. To avoid this, intermittent, single-dose administration of steroids was performed on a trial basis in the present study. Prednisolone, in doses of 50-100 mg, was given once every 3-7 days in three steroid-dependent myasthenic patients, in one case for up to 6 years. The effects of the intermittent treatment were as good as, and adverse effects less frequently found than in single-dose, alternate-day administration. 
Peritoneal adhesion formation after lysis: inhibition by polyethylene glycol 4000. Peritoneal adhesions cause much long-term postoperative morbidity. This study evaluates the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 in reducing adhesion reformation after lysis. Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy. At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20). When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation. The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups). Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis. 
Parathyroid hormone-related protein of malignancy: immunohistochemical and biochemical studies in normocalcaemic and hypercalcaemic patients with cancer. Immunohistochemical staining for parathyroid hormone-related protein was performed in 27 tumours from 19 normocalcaemic and eight hypercalcaemic patients with cancer. All the tumours from hypercalcaemic patients stained positively for the protein, as did 17 tumours from normocalcaemic patients. Only hypercalcaemic patients had biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption and abnormalities of renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, consistent with the presence of parathyroid hormone-related protein. While tumour mass was higher in hypercalcaemic patients, only one of the initially normocalcaemic patients with positively staining tumours subsequently went on to develop hypercalcaemia and more advanced disease. These data confirm the importance of parathyroid hormone-related protein as a mediator of humoral hypercalcaemia in patients with solid tumours and suggest that low tumour mass may be one reason why serum calcium values are not increased in all patients with tumours containing parathyroid hormone-related protein. None the less normocalcaemia, despite tumour progression in patients whose tumours stained positively for parathyroid hormone-related protein, suggests that other factors may also be important, such as differences in the rate of secretion of the protein by different tumours, or the production of different forms of parathyroid hormone-related protein with varying biological effects. 
Association of sebaceous gland tumors and internal malignancy: the Muir-Torre syndrome. The Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by: (1) at least a single sebaceous gland tumor (either an adenoma, an epithelioma, or a carcinoma) and (2) a minimum of one internal malignancy. To date, 120 patients with MTS have been reported. The most commonly associated neoplasms were colorectal (51%) and genitourinary (25%). Unlike colorectal neoplasms in the general population, the majority (58%) of these tumors in MTS patients occurred proximal to or at the splenic flexure. Nearly half of the MTS patients had more than one primary malignancy. Cutaneous lesions occurred before or concurrent with the diagnosis of the initial cancer in 41% of these patients. The median age for the appearance of the skin lesions was 53 years (range, 23 to 89 years); the median age for the detection of the initial visceral neoplasm was 50 years (range, 23 to 81 years). The cancers appear to have an indolent course in many of the MTS patients; the median survival has not been reached and the median follow-up is 10+ years. Patients with an MTS-associated cutaneous lesion should have a complete evaluation for gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers. Although the penetrance of this disease is variable, its autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that relatives should be examined for sebaceous gland tumors and internal malignancy. 
Lymphoproliferative disorders of the thyroid gland: radiological appearances. Images of lymphoproliferative disorders of the thyroid by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), 99Tcm and 67Ga scintigraphy were analysed in eight patients (two men and six women, aged 42-83 years). Seven patients were diagnosed as having primary lymphoma and one plasmacytoma. Ultrasound revealed a solid mass with homogeneous and very low echogenicity clearly distinguishable from residual thyroid tissue in five patients, diffuse hypoechoic goitre in one and multiple irregular hypoechoic nodules in both lobes in the patient with plasmacytoma (Case 8). Computed tomography demonstrated a focal low-density area in six cases of lymphoma and decreased density throughout the gland in the other two patients. 99Tcm scintigraphy showed hemilobar enlargement with decreased and uneven trapping, cold area or complete lobar defect in six patients with lymphoma and no trapping in the case of plasmacytoma. 67Ga scintigraphy demonstrated high accumulation in lymphoma and faint accumulation in the case of plasmacytoma. Radiological manifestations with a focal lesion were considered typical and diagnostic of primary thyroid lymphoma, while in one case with diffuse infiltration through the whole gland, the differential diagnosis from Hashimoto's thyroiditis could not be made. In the final case, cells infiltrated diffusely to form islands with patchy distribution among well preserved follicles, correlating with the multiple hypoechoic areas observed by US. 
Diagnosis of mitral valve aneurysm by transoesophageal echocardiography. In a patient with mitral valve aneurysm precordial echocardiography suggested a mistaken diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Transoesophageal echocardiographic examination established the correct diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed at operation. Transoesophageal echocardiography gives better resolution of lesions associated with the mitral valve than precordial examination and may improve the diagnostic accuracy. 
Inhibition of entry of HIV-1 in neural cell lines by antibodies against galactosyl ceramide. Although the CD4 molecule is the principal cellular receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), several CD4-negative cell lines are susceptible to infection with one or more HIV strains. These findings indicate that there are alternate modes of viral entry, perhaps involving one or more receptor molecules. Antibodies against galactosyl ceramide (galactocerebroside, or GalC) inhibited viral internalization and infection in two CD4-negative cell lines derived from the nervous system: U373-MG and SK-N-MC. Furthermore, recombinant HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 bound to GalC but not to other glycolipids. These results suggest a role for GalC or a highly related molecule in HIV entry into neural cells. 
Listeria monocytogenes infections in patients with AIDS: report of five cases and review. Five patients with AIDS and Listeria monocytogenes infection (three cases of bacteremia and two of meningitis) are reviewed. Four patients had prior or concurrent gastrointestinal illness. Two patients received corticosteroids. A 7- to 21-day course of ampicillin was administered with or without a 7- to 14-day course of gentamicin. This regimen was effective, with no evidence of relapse 7-8 months after therapy was discontinued. The relative infrequency of infection with L. monocytogenes in AIDS patients is unexpected. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) appears to be essential in the inhibition of Listeria in vivo. Elevated levels of TNF in AIDS patients may be protective against listeriosis and thus help explain the low prevalence of listerial infection in this population. Nonetheless, although L. monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of illness in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, it cannot be dismissed as a cause of undefined meningitis or sepsis. 
Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene. Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al., at the 5' end of the gene. 
Age-specific differences in the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer. Nearly all studies have suggested that the use of oral contraceptives (OC) is not associated with the aggregate risk of breast cancer diagnosed in women aged 20-54. Because of age-specific differences in the breast cancer-parity relationship and because of age-specific differences in other breast cancer risk factors, the Centers for Disease Control reexamined data from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study to assess whether OC use has different effects on the risk of breast cancer at different ages of diagnosis. This was a population-based case-control study conducted in eight geographic areas in the United States during 1980-1982. In these data, the relationship between the risk of breast cancer and OC use appeared to vary by age at diagnosis. Among women aged 20-34 years at diagnosis or interview, those who had ever used OC had a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-2.1) when compared with women of the same ages who had never used OC. Among these women, there were no trends of increasing or decreasing risk with any measure of OC use. Among women aged 35-44 years, there was no association between OC use and breast cancer. Among women aged 45-54 years, those who used OC had a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). Among these women, the risk estimates decreased significantly with increasing time since first and last use. Although the slightly increased risk estimates for the youngest women are compatible with findings by other investigators, the decreased risk estimates for the oldest women have not been described in as many studies. Available data provide no reasons for changes in prescribing practices or in the use of OC as related to breast cancer risk. 
Delayed postanoxic encephalopathy after strangulation. Serial neuroradiological and neurochemical studies. A 13-year-old boy was the victim of attempted strangulation. His condition had returned to normal by the sixth day after the assault; however, from the seventh day, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and marked pseudobulbar paralysis developed in the boy. The computed tomographic scans and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that were obtained at this time revealed low-density and high-signal intensities in the region of the bilateral putamen and caudate nucleus. These symptoms and the changes in his computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images subsided gradually during a 2-month period. Sequential analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid for gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine concentrations during his illness revealed reciprocal changes with normal recovery. Because of the delayed onset of neurological changes and the cerebrospinal fluid showing reversible symptoms, the delayed encephalopathy after strangulation had been related to the biochemical alterations that followed anoxia in the vulnerable basal ganglia. 
Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system: involvement of penetrating vessels at the base of the brain. Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (IAC) was diagnosed in a 40-year-old Caucasian male by histological examination of a leptomeningeal biopsy specimen, and the exclusion of systemic inflammatory or infective disease. Therapy with prednisone 30 mg/day and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day resulted in clinical and radiological improvement, which have been maintained for an 8-month follow-up period. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions implicating involvement of specific penetrating vessels at the base of the brain, an unusual complication of IAC, and allowed an accurate MRI-clinical correlation. 
Current status of coronary artery operation in septuagenarians. Previous reports of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting have not addressed the current era of aggressive percutaneous angioplasty and frequent urgent or emergent operation. To investigate this important subgroup of patients, we analyzed our recent coronary artery bypass grafting experience with patients 70 years of age or older. From January 1984 to January 1989, 121 consecutive patients in this age range underwent surgical revascularization at our institution. Overall in-hospital operative mortality (OM) was 7.4% (9/121), with 77.8% (7/9) of deaths due to cardiac causes. Serious postoperative morbidity occurred in 71.1% (86/121). Surgical priority was significantly correlated with operative mortality: for elective cases, the OM was 2.9% (2/68), but it was 8.6% (3/35) for urgent cases (p less than 0.05) and 22.2% (4/18) for emergency cases (p less than 0.05). Univariate analysis isolated the need for inotropic support, intraaortic balloon pump, reoperation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and emergency status as significant risk factors for OM (p less than 0.05). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the need for inotropic support, intravenous nitroglycerin, reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting, and hypertension as independently significant risk factors. A logistic risk equation developed from this population accurately modeled OM at the extremes of operative risk. Three (3.1%) of the 97 patients predicted to have less than 5% OM died, whereas all patients predicted by the model to have greater than 90% OM died. These results indicate that in spite of relatively high morbidity and mortality rates, elderly patients have a very acceptable operative risk in the current era of high-risk coronary artery bypass grafting. This is particularly true if elective revascularization is possible. 
Minimal role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in rat renal tubular reoxygenation injury. The role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in postischemic reperfusion injury in the rat kidney remains controversial. Proximal tubules, the focal segment affected by ischemic renal injury, were isolated in bulk, assayed for xanthine oxidase activity, and subjected to 60 min of anoxia or hypoxia and 60 min of reoxygenation to evaluate the participation of xanthine oxidase and oxygen radicals in proximal tubule reoxygenation injury. The total xanthine oxidase in isolated rat proximal tubules was 1.1 mU/mg of protein, approximately 30% to 40% of the activity found in rat intestine and liver. Lactate dehydrogenase release, an indicator of irreversible cell damage, increased substantially during anoxia (39.8 +/- 2.3 versus 9.8 +/- 1.8% in controls) with an additional 8 to 12% release during reoxygenation. Addition of 0.2 mM allopurinol, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, failed to protect against the reoxygenation lactate dehydrogenase release. Analysis of xanthine oxidase substrate levels after anoxia and flux rates during reoxygenation indicates that hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations are in a 15-fold excess over the enzyme Km and 0.3 mU/mg of protein of xanthine oxidase activity exists during reoxygenation. Hypoxic tubule suspensions had a minimal lactate dehydrogenase release during hypoxia and failed to demonstrate accelerated injury upon reoxygenation. In conclusion, although xanthine oxidase is present and active during reoxygenation in isolated rat proximal tubules, oxygen radicals did not mediate reoxygenation injury. 
The ethics of nontreatment of patients with cancers of the head and neck. There are three levels at which nontreatment decisions for patients with cancers of the head and neck might be made: not doing further diagnostic procedures when the data gained would not make a significant difference to treatment decisions; not continuing aggressive therapy when its benefits are outweighed by the ensuing burdens and harms; and, at the policy level, not providing costly aggressive therapy at all because of the number of patients with unmet, more basic needs. These three levels of nontreatment decisions are discussed in light of ethical theory, briefly introduced. Arguments are made in favor of nontreatment decisions at the two clinical levels mentioned above, but against a policy decision to ration treatment for patients with cancers of the head and neck. 
Outcome in children who nearly drown: a British Isles study OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed. 
Hemangiopericytoma of the lacrimal sac. Hemangiopericytomas of the orbit are rare tumors with low malignancy potential. To the authors' knowledge, only three previous cases of these tumors occurring in the lacrimal sac have been reported. The authors report a fourth case. Follow-up was obtained on the first reported case, and the patient in that case had a recurrence after 15 years. These tumors should be totally excised and followed for long periods of time. 
Anaerobic pathogenesis: collagenase production by Peptostreptococcus magnus and its relationship to site of infection. Fifty isolates of Peptostreptococcus magnus from intraabdominal sepsis, nonpuerperal breast abscess, and diabetic foot infections were examined for collagenase activity using bovine type I collagen. Collagenase production was detected in a higher percentage of strains from nonpuerperal breast and diabetic foot specimens (P less than .001). This enzyme may be responsible for P. magnus playing a more central role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal breast abscess and diabetic foot disease than in intraabdominal sepsis. 
Sternohyoid muscle biopsy. A diagnostic technique in respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin. Patients with neuromuscular disease may develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We describe a sternohyoid muscle biopsy technique as a diagnostic aid in such patients undergoing tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support. The biopsy procedure is quick and without added discomfort or morbidity for the patient. Our preliminary observations in three patients suggest that the sternohyoid muscle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in this selected group of patients. 
Quantitative coronary arteriographic methods in the interventional catheterization laboratory: an update and perspective. Recent research advances in the area of quantitative coronary arteriography are described with respect to their potential role in assessing the effects of interventional therapy and monitoring the restenosis process. Specific areas emphasized are the importance of quantitative arteriography and absolute measures of arterial dimension in monitoring restenosis, the development of a computerized method for measuring lesion roughness, the potential role of measuring stenosis flow reserve based on component analysis principles, limitations of direct measures of myocardial flow reserve using a digital angiographic method and cautionary notes about clinical applications of videodensitometry. The current use of radiography and quantitative measures in limiting arterial injury are briefly reviewed. Finally, a perspective is put forth on the need to develop complementary roles for endovascular echocardiography and angioscopy with existing radiographic imaging technology. 
Morphometric studies in rectal biopsy specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis: effect of oral 5 amino salicylic acid and rectal prednisolone treatment. Morphometric measurements were performed on rectal biopsy specimens from 10 normal control subjects and 33 patients with a relapse of distal ulcerative colitis before and after treatment for four weeks in a double blind controlled trial with oral eudragit S coated 5 amino salicylic acid (n = 12) or rectal prednisolone enemas (n = 15). Measurements were assessed using a computer aided measuring system and a counting technique. When untreated patients were compared with the control group there were significant decreases in the area and height of the surface epithelium, in the area of crypt epithelium, and in the ratios of goblet cells to epithelial cells and of surface epithelium to lamina propria. The vascular and lamina propria areas and the number of intraepithelial polymorphs were increased. Treatment with 5 amino salicylic acid and corticosteroids resulted in similar morphological improvements: there was an increase in the area and height of the surface epithelium and the ratios of surface epithelium to lamina propria and of surface to crypt cell height. The ratio of goblet cells to epithelial cells also increased after treatment, while the numbers of polymorphs in the surface and crypt epithelium and lumen decreased. In conclusion, computerised morphometry is valuable for the assessment of the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis and that in the doses used both treatments were of similar efficacy. 
Risk of cataract and history of severe diarrheal disease in southern India. A case-control study was carried out in the state of Tamil Nadu, southern India, to examine the association between the risk of visually disabling cataract and a lifetime history of severe diarrhea (including cholera). A series of 421 subjects, aged 35 to 65 years, meeting case (n = 181) and control (n = 240) eligibility criteria were enrolled from 19 rural cataract-screening camps. Ninety case-control pairs were postmatched for (reported) age (+/- 2 years), sex, and area of residence. A history of diarrhea was obtained by using an algorithm developed by other investigators in India who have reported a strong association between cataract and diarrhea. An odds ratio of 0.8 (95% confidence limits: 0.0, 3.2) was obtained from matched pairs analysis, and an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence limit: 0.6, 2.7) was obtained among all subjects (n = 392) from a logistic analysis that adjusted for age, sex, occupation, area of residence, and caste. Findings of this study do not support the hypothesis of an increased risk of visually disabling cataract in persons with a positive history of severe diarrhea. 
Coronary-subclavian steal corrected with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We describe a case of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A 58-year-old female who had her first coronary bypass operation 6 years previously and a second operation 3 years previously involving the left internal mammary artery and right gastroepiploic artery, developed unusual angina on effort characterized by left precordial pain, pain in the left shoulder and arm, tinnitus and dizziness. Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery. Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium. Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms. 
Clinical significance of soluble CD30 antigen in the sera of patients with untreated Hodgkin's disease. The soluble form of the CD30 antigen (sCD30), an 88-kd glycoprotein that is released by Hodgkin's-derived cell lines in vitro, can be detected in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult (HTLV-1+) T-cell leukemia, rare cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute infectious mononucleosis (anti-EBV-IgM+). In a prospective study of 90 consecutive untreated patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease who were treated according to the protocols of the German Hodgkin Study group, 22% had detectable levels of sCD30 in their serum. sCD30 was only detected in patients with B symptoms (20 of 44 or 45%), and maximum sCD30 levels (88 U/mL) were found in stage IVB. Of 87 patients evaluable for response, sCD30+ patients had significantly lower rates of complete remission (9 of 20 or 45% v 60 of 67 or 90%; P less than .001) and higher rates of progressive disease (9 of 20 or 45% v 6 of 67 or 9%; P less than .001) than CD30+ patients. Similarly, freedom from treatment failure curves were significantly worse for CD30+ patients (P = .0003). sCD30 disappeared after successful treatment, but increased in patients with progressive disease. It was never detected in patients in complete remission or in healthy controls. We conclude that sCD30 is a valuable marker for disease activity and has prognostic significance in Hodgkin's disease. 
Basic fibroblast growth factor and somatomedin C in human medulloepithelioma. Two published cases of medulloepithelioma, a rare malignant pediatric brain tumor composed of a mixture of primitive neuroepithelium and its differentiated neuronal and glial descendants, were examined by immunohistochemical staining for the presence of growth factors. From a panel of antibodies, those identifying basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I, formerly known as somatomedin C, were strongly immunoreactive within the neuroepithelial cell population of the tumors. Immunoblots of purified recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I showed antibody specificity without cross-reactivity. In controls, immunostaining of tissue sections was abolished by preabsorption of primary antibodies with the appropriate growth factor polypeptide antigen. Preabsorption with inappropriate growth factor did not reduce the intensity or alter the distribution of staining. The congruent histologic patterns of immunoreactivities suggest that more than one type of growth factor may be produced by the neuroepithelial component of medulloepithelioma. These growth factors may stimulate proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells by autocrine molecular mechanisms. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
Conjunctival necrosis after administration of topical fortified aminoglycosides. We treated 11 episodes of bulbar conjunctival necrosis that occurred in ten patients after therapy for suppurative keratitis with topical fortified aminoglycosides. Chemosis and mucous discharge preceded the development of an area of conjunctival pallor, which stained with fluorescein and was 5 to 10 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. Typical lesions developed in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva after a mean of 4.8 days and 112 mg of gentamicin sulfate (109 drops). The fortified aminoglycoside was the only agent common to all cases. The conjunctival defects healed completely between five and 13 days after treatment was modified to reduce or eliminate aminoglycoside exposure. 
Prediction of death and myocardial infarction by radionuclide angiocardiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of radionuclide angiocardiography was examined in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Nine hundred and eight patients who underwent rest and exercise radionuclide angiocardiography without subsequent cardiac catheterization were followed for a median of 4.6 years. Fifty-two cardiovascular deaths and 28 nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred during the follow-up period. Thirty-nine radionuclide angiocardiographic and clinical variables were analyzed in association with the end points of cardiovascular death, total cardiac events and death from all causes using the Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Univariable analysis identified the exercise ejection fraction as the best predictor of cardiovascular death (chi-square = 82), total cardiac events (chi-square = 84) and death from all causes (chi-square = 66). A small subset of patients (n = 45) with an exercise ejection fraction less than 0.35 were at high risk for future cardiac events, whereas most patients (n = 776) had an exercise ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and a low probability of a subsequent event. Three variables--the exercise ejection fraction, the exercise change in heart rate, and gender--contained independent prognostic information determined by multivariable analysis. The exercise ejection fraction was the strongest independent predictor (p less than 0.0001) for every end point. The measurement of ventricular function during exercise provides important independent prognostic information in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Radionuclide angiocardiography successfully identifies patients requiring invasive assessment, and the low probability of cardiac events in patients with good exercise ventricular function obviates the need for interventional therapy. 
Efficacy of feedback training in long-standing facial nerve paresis. An efficacious treatment has not been available to patients with aberrant regeneration of the facial nerve as a result of Bell's palsy or after acoustic neuroma excision. This prospective controlled trial examines the efficacy of electromyographic feedback versus mirror feedback as treatment strategies for patients suffering from long-standing (18 months minimum) facial nerve paresis. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to electromyography with mirror feedback or mirror feedback alone. Seven rural patients who did not undergo treatment served as controls. At 0, 6, and 12 months, facial motor function was objectively quantified by linear measurement of facial movement, visual assessment of voluntary movement, and electrical measurement of facial nerve response to maximal stimulation. Statistically significant improvements were noted in both electromyography and mirror-feedback groups with respect to symmetry of voluntary movement (P less than .03) and linear measurement of facial expression (P less than .01). The positive results of this controlled trial demonstrate that feedback training in combination with a structured home rehabilitation program is a clinically efficacious treatment for patients with facial nerve paresis. 
Safety and cost effectiveness of combined coronary angiography and angioplasty. If coronary angioplasty can be safely performed at the time of the initial diagnostic catheterization, it may result in shorter hospitalization stays and lower overall costs. Combined coronary angiography and angioplasty was performed electively on 733 patients between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1988. These patients were divided into three major subgroups based upon their indications for angioplasty: 444 (61%) procedures were performed for restenosis; 190 (26%) procedures were performed in patients for unstable angina; and 99 (13%) procedures were performed in patients without unstable angina or previous angioplasty. A subset of 219 patients from this study who underwent elective combined coronary angiography and angioplasty during 1986 were compared with a matched population of 191 patients from the angiography and angioplasty as separate procedures). The success and complication rates were similar for both of these groups. Patients who underwent the combined procedure were hospitalized for a mean of 4.6 days with average total charges of $11,128, compared with 8.0 days and $13,160 for patients undergoing separate procedures (p less than 0.001). Significant savings were also realized with respect to total contrast dose, fluoroscopic time, and total procedural time. Thus in informed patients with suitable coronary anatomy, the strategy of combined angiography and angioplasty may present an opportunity for decreasing hospitalization stay, reducing total charges for revascularization, and reducing radiation exposure without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the procedure. 
Fibrous dysplasia vs adamantinoma of the tibia: differentiation based on discriminant analysis of clinical and plain film findings. Differentiation between benign fibrous dysplasia and malignant adamantinoma of the tibia is challenging because of the impact the diagnosis has on the choice of treatment (none or extensive surgery). The histologic and pathologic similarities of the lesions and the controversial relationship between fibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia, and adamantinoma complicate the matter. We found a large overlap of histologic features in lesions considered either fibrous dysplasia or osteofibrous dysplasia on the basis of the radiologic findings. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the plain radiograph of the lower leg in combination with clinical findings to differentiate the benign from the malignant condition. The clinical symptoms, radiographs, and histologic slides of 46 patients with fibrous dysplasia and 22 with adamantinoma in the tibia were reviewed retrospectively. In only one of 12 patients with radiologic or histologic characteristics of osteofibrous dysplasia were both radiologic and histologic criteria for the diagnosis present. A linear discriminant analysis was performed on six clinical (age, spontaneous pain, pain after trauma, swelling only, pain and swelling, and bowing deformity) and 25 radiologic signs. Fibrous dysplasia and its variant osteofibrous dysplasia could be identified correctly in 87% (40 of 46 patients) and adamantinoma in 95% (21 of 22 patients) by using the patient's age and four radiologic signs. When results from the discriminant analysis of a randomized subgroup of patients (32) were used on the other subgroup (36 patients), fibrous dysplasia was correctly identified in 84% (21 of 25) and adamantinoma in 82% (nine of 11). Fibrous dysplasia is more prevalent than adamantinoma in a young patient, when radiographs show a ground-glass appearance and anterior bowing and when there is no multilayered periosteal reaction and moth-eaten destruction. When radiologic signs and the patient's age are combined, fibrous dysplasia and adamantinoma can be discriminated in a high percentage of patients. 
Comparison of mastectomy and lumpectomy for medial carcinoma of the breast. The recurrence and five year disease-free survival rates of 86 patients with carcinoma of the breast located in the medial quadrants who had either lumpectomy and radiotherapy or mastectomy were compared. Patients who had lumpectomy and mastectomy were comparable with respect to variables reflecting extent of the disease. One of 54 patients who had lumpectomy had a local recurrence and five had a recurrence regionally or at distant sites. In the group of 32 patients who had a mastectomy, one patient had a local recurrence and an additional four patients had a recurrence at other sites. The five year study disease-free survival rate was 83 per cent for the lumpectomy group and 78 per cent for the mastectomy group. These data suggest that, for medial quadrant lesions, there may be a disease-free survival advantage associated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy over mastectomy. Further study of this treatment modality for this subset of patients seems indicated. 
Cytostatic extravasation. A serious complication of long-term venous access. Totally implantable ports have gained popularity as venous access in the treatment of cancer. A case is reported with an uncommon but very serious complication, i.e., cytostatic extravasation secondary to a broken implanted catheter. Guidelines for implantation and remedies are recommended. 
Prevalence of chronic migraine headaches--United States, 1980-1989. Migraine headaches, which are characterized by painful, disabling, and recurring symptoms, have no known cause, treatment, or cure. Quality population-based data are needed to improve epidemiologic understanding of chronic migraine headaches. This report uses data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the prevalence of recent trends in the occurrence of chronic migraine headaches in the United States from 1980 through 1989. 
Diagnosis and laparoscopic grading of acute salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity in women of reproductive age. Findings of bilateral adnexal tenderness and signs of a lower genital tract infection (mucopus, or leukorrhea, or both) should prompt clinicians to consider the diagnosis of salpingitis in this group of women. Additional signs of infection, such as elevated temperature, palpable adnexal complex, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or c-reactive protein, and positive tests for either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis will improve the overall specificity of the clinical diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy offers an acceptable approach to documenting objectively inflammation of the upper genital tract. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered in all patients but may be especially helpful for those patients in whom a diagnosis is unclear. A laparoscopic grading system based primarily on tubal mobility and inflammation can be useful in predicting duration of in-hospital therapy and future tubal factor infertility. 
Economic analyses in hypertension: applications for healthcare providers. Hypertension affects millions of Americans. With healthcare dollars becoming more closely scrutinized, economic studies are playing an important role in helping decision makers choose who should receive treatment and which treatments and methods of administration are most cost-effective. This article provides an overview of the different methods used in economic evaluation and demonstrates the utility of each method using studies from the hypertension literature. 
Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood with CD10, TdT, and cytoplasmic mu lymphocyte positivity in bone marrow. Over three years, three children presented with anaemia, reticulocytopenia, and marrow erythroblastopenia. A pronounced lymphocytosis was also evident in two of the marrow aspirates, with increased numbers of cells bearing the immunophenotype TdT+, CD10+ HLA DR+, and cytoplasmic mu +, and reported to be compatible with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The clinical course of the illness was fully compatible with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC), and all three children remained well one to four years after initial presentation. It is concluded that increased numbers of lymphoid cells with a common or pre-B ALL phenotype may be found in bone marrow aspirates of children with TEC, and should not be misdiagnosed as acute leukaemia. 
Zinc in the management of tinnitus. Placebo-controlled trial. To assess any possible beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus we performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind investigation. Forty-eight patients with tinnitus were randomized to either placebo or the administration of zinc sulfate as sustained-release tablets of 22 mg Zn++ (Zinklet). The tablets were administered three times daily for 8 weeks. Every week the patients stated the severity of tinnitus on a number scale from 0 to 10. The levels of zinc and albumin in serum were determined both before and after treatment. Of 48 patients with tinnitus, hypozincemia was found in only one patient. The zinc level increased significantly in the patients treated with zinc. We could not demonstrate any beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus. One of the essential reasons for this finding could be that the zinc levels in serum were in the normal range previous to treatment. 
In situ fresh allograft replacement of an infected aortic prosthetic graft: eighteen months' follow-up. We report a case in which an allogenic aortic graft was used to treat the last one of a series of infectious graft complications. The original operation was a Dacron aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease in an institution other than ours. The patient was referred for the treatment of the infection of the prosthetic implant. We inserted a prosthetic bypass from the left axillary to the left deep femoral artery, as well as a crossover autogenous saphenous vein graft from the prosthesis to the right deep femoral artery; in the same operation the infected intraabdominal prosthesis was removed with closure of the proximal aortic stump. Subsequent stenosis of the vein graft made it necessary to insert a prosthetic bypass between the descending thoracic aorta and the two deep femoral arteries. Infection of the last named prosthesis made it necessary to remove it and replace it with a tailored allogenic arterial allograft between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and both deep femoral arteries. The patient had an uneventful recovery as the infection was controlled and both lower limbs were salvaged. Eighteen months later the allograft was patent without any signs of degeneration. Further clinical experience under appropriate conditions may prove the use of allografts effective in the treatment of selected cases of aortic prosthetic infection. 
Low-energy catheter electrical ablation for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Catheter electrical ablation using a relatively low level of energy--40 to 100 joules--was attempted in 12 consecutive patients with drug-refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). They had 19 monomorphic VTs, and ischemic heart disease was found as the underlying heart disease in one, nonischemic heart disease was found in nine, and no structural heart disease was seen in two patients. Electrical discharge was delivered at the site of the earliest endocardial activation in 17 VTs, and at the slow conduction area in two VTs. Among 19 VTs in 12 patients, 12 VTs (63%) in seven patients (58%) were successfully ablated and became noninducible during electrophysiologic study. There were no major complications, but transient atrioventricular block occurred in one patient and transient friction rub occurred in another. Delivered electrical energy and the time interval between the local electrogram and the surface QRS did not correlate with the clinical outcome of the procedure. However, "excellent" pace-mapped QRS morphology was obtained from the site of earliest activation or from the slow conduction area in 9 of 12 VTs in the successful cases but in only one of seven VTs in the unsuccessful cases. Low-energy catheter electrical ablation seems to be a satisfactory therapeutic procedure compared with the conventional method that uses an energy level of 200 joules or higher. 
Stereotactic management of colloid cysts: factors predicting success. Stereotactic aspiration is a valuable surgical alternative for colloid cysts when used alone or in conjunction with microsurgical resection. Since 1981, the authors have performed computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic aspiration as the initial procedure in 22 patients with colloid cysts; stereotactic aspiration alone was successful in 11 patients (50%). Of the 11 patients in whom aspiration failed, stereotactic endoscopic resection was attempted in three and was successful in one. Seven patients required a craniotomy and microsurgical removal of the cyst performed via a transcortical approach. The preoperative CT appearance in eight cases of a hypodense or isodense cyst correlated favorably with successful aspiration of the cyst in six patients. A hyperdense appearance on the preoperative CT scan in 14 cases was associated with subtotal aspiration in 13 patients; five required craniotomy for removal. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in eight patients provided excellent anatomical definition of the cyst and its relationship to other structures of the third ventricle, but it was not possible to correlate successful aspiration with cyst appearance on MR images with short or long relaxation time sequences. The authors' 9-year experience suggests that preoperative CT studies accurately determine size, predict viscosity, and help to define a group of colloid cyst patients for whom stereotactic cyst aspiration will likely be successful. Unsuccessful stereotactic aspiration was related to two features: the high viscosity of the intracystic colloid material (nine patients), or deviation of the cyst away from the aspiration needle due to small cyst volume (two patients). Because of its simplicity and low risk, stereotactic surgery can be offered to selected patients as the initial procedure of choice. Craniotomy can be reserved for those whose imaging studies predict failure or for those whose cyst cannot be aspirated. 
A therapeutic dilemma: suppressive doses of thyroxine significantly reduce bone mineral measurements in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with thyroid carcinoma. We measured lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm bone mineral (BMD) in 24 women (14 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal) who had been treated with total thyroidectomy and 131 Iodine ablation therapy for nonanaplastic thyroid carcinoma and 24 case controls. At the time of the study, all patients were free of cancer (negative 131 Iodine whole body scan and serum thyroglobulin levels less than 0.3 micrograms/L) and all were receiving doses of T4 sufficiently high to prevent a rise in a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration after an iv bolus of TRH. Femoral neck BMD were significantly reduced in both the premenopausal women (89 +/- 3.8% of case controls, 95% CI, 81 to 98) and postmenopausal women (77 +/- 3.9% of case controls; 95% CI, 68 to 86) receiving T4. Lumbar spine BMD and forearm BMD were unaffected in the premenopausal women, but significantly reduced in the postmenopausal women receiving T4 (lumbar spine BMD = 84 +/- 6.2% of case controls; 95% CI, 70 to 98 and forearm BMD = 89 +/- 5.6% of case controls; 95% CI, 76 to 101). Serum bone Gla-protein, a marker of bone turnover, was significantly increased in both the premenopausal and the postmenopausal women receiving T4 compared to case controls (P less than 0.001 for the difference between patient groups and controls). Whereas the cumulative dose of T4 was highly correlated with the femoral neck BMD in the premenopausal patients (r = 0.528; P less than 0.05); the presence of hypogonadism was the main determinant of the lumbar spine and forearm BMD. This data confirms that premenopausal and postmenopausal women receiving suppressive doses of T4 for thyroid carcinoma have diminished bone mineral measurements and are at risk for osteoporosis. 
Myocardial oedema and ventricular function after cardioplegia with added mannitol. Myocardial oedema may contribute to the impaired myocardial performance which commonly follows open heart surgery with cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest. The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion. In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated. The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group). The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion. It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest. 
Histopathologic comparison between human oral squamous cell carcinomas and their xenografts in nude mice. Tumor portions were obtained from 11 oral squamous cell carcinomas and used to produce tumors in a xenogeneic gnotobiotic nude mouse model system. The tumors that developed were examined histologically. The cellular features and tumor growth patterns were compared between the original oral squamous cell carcinoma (T0) and the tumor that developed in the xenogeneic host (T1). The T1 tumors were more highly differentiated in comparison with the T0 tumors. The T1 tumors exhibited less cellular pleomorphism and a more uniform pattern of stratification. The cells in the T1 tumors exhibited an increased mitotic index but did not contain abnormal mitoses. The T1 tumors usually exhibited nodular growth patterns rather than the infiltrating pattern exhibited by the parenchyma of the T0 tumors. The desmoplastic reaction was markedly reduced in the T1 tumors. The results indicated that the gnotobiotic nude mouse model system either selects for or induces a more differentiated pattern of tumor growth than that found in the original human oral squamous cell carcinomas. 
Acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis induced by hydrochlorothiazide [published erratum appears in Can Med Assoc J 1991 Sep 1;145(5):391] OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical features of 4 unpublished cases and 26 published cases of acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis induced by hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). DATA SOURCES: The unpublished cases were found in the database of the Drug Adverse Reaction Program, Health Protection Branch, Department of National Health and Welfare, and the database of the Programme conjoint de pharmacovigilance, in Quebec. The published cases were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: Reported cases were selected if they were sufficiently documented. All published cases were selected because a differential diagnosis had been made in each one. DATA SYNTHESIS: The onset was acute and dramatic; the average time to onset of symptoms was 44 minutes. Sex was a predominant risk factor, since 27 (90%) of the 30 patients were women. The average age was 56 years; thus, most of the women were postmenopausal. Over two-thirds of the patients had one to three positive prechallenges or rechallenges, 3 of the 52 documented adverse events occurred after a voluntary rechallenge, some were life-threatening and necessitated mechanical ventilation, and 1 was fatal. Treatment was supportive; avoidance of HCT was the only prevention. CONCLUSION: Acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis due to HCT is extremely rare and potentially fatal. Such a reaction can be diagnosed only if the clinician suspects it when presented with a case of unexplained acute pulmonary edema. 
Deglutition syncope with coexistent carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A 63-year-old man had symptomatic deglutition-induced atrioventricular (A-V) block. There was also a coexistent mixed type carotid sinus hypersensitivity presenting as A-V block. No A-V nodal dysfunction was revealed during electrophysiologic studies. The vasodepressor response to carotid massage implies a central vagal hyperresponsiveness, which can also explain the cardioinhibitory responses to swallowing and carotid sinus massage, both possibly unmasked by posterior myocardial infarction. 
Opposing actions of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone on insulin sensitivity. In vivo and in vitro studies of hyperandrogenic females. It has been hypothesized that the androgens testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may have opposing actions on insulin sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we selected patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and hypertestosteronemia and a group of individuals with adrenal hyperplasia (AH) and elevated DHEA and studied their 1) insulin and glucose responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, 2) insulin resistance by hypoglycemic responses to a standard dose of intravenous (IV) insulin, and 3) insulin binding and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) responsiveness to insulin in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T lymphocytes. PCO patients exhibited elevated basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels and had blunted hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin. Conversely, AH patients had hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin significantly greater than and basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels lower than the PCO patients and weight-matched control subjects. In vitro, T-lymphocyte insulin binding of the PCO patients was 40-60% below control values; in AH patients, insulin binding and PDH insulin sensitivity were above those of the control subjects. Testosterone levels in all study subjects were negatively correlated to T-lymphocyte insulin binding and positively correlated to basal insulin, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and insulin-glucose indices. DHEA levels were positively correlated to insulin binding and inversely related to basal insulin, insulin AUC, and insulin-glucose indices. In all instances, the parameters of insulin sensitivity were more strongly correlated to individuals' ratios of DHEA to testosterone than to either of these androgens alone. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Failure of right-sided coloanal anastomosis for treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. Report of a case. A patient with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum and distal colon underwent a left hemicolectomy, a mucosal proctectomy, and a coloanal sleeve anastomosis using the normal proximal colon. She experienced macroscopic recurrence of her disease within 2 months of the operation and eventually required excision of the remaining colon and an end ileostomy. Our experience and that of others would indicate that a right-sided coloanal operation is unsuitable for the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. 
Reactive occipital epileptiform activity: is it benign? Occipital epileptiform activity that is almost continuous and reactive to eye opening has been associated with a childhood epilepsy syndrome and basilar migraine with seizures. An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed. In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern. The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years. The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment. Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures. Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence. Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group. This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy. 
Methanol poisoning. A rodent model with structural and functional evidence for retinal involvement. Methanol ingestion can lead to visual impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, or death. The extent of ocular involvement has been difficult to determine because the toxicity is restricted to humans and nonhuman primates due to species differences in methanol metabolism. A rodent model of methanol toxicity recently developed by us was used to evaluate retinal dysfunction in methanol poisoning. Formic acidemia and visual toxic reactions developed in methanol-intoxicated rats. Electroretinographic analysis indicated a significant early deficit in b-wave amplitude followed by a temporally delayed, lesser reduction in a-wave amplitude. Histologic evaluation of the eyes 60 hours after methanol administration revealed generalized retinal edema and vacuolation in the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Ultrastructural examination showed swelling and disruption of the mitochondria in photoreceptor inner segments, optic nerve, and the retinal pigment epithelium. These studies document direct retinal involvement in this nonprimate model of methanol toxicity. 
Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Dopa-responsive dystonia: long-term treatment response and prognosis. We report observations on the treatment of 66 patients with presumed dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Forty-seven of these patients had hereditary disease; 19 had disease of sporadic occurrence. Initial diagnostic confusion with "cerebral palsy" or "spastic diplegia" existed in 16 patients. Several patients benefited from anticholinergic medications and a few from carbamazepine. Levodopa was the most effective treatment in all cases. In the majority, there was an excellent response, with continued long-term clinical stability on levodopa therapy for as long as 10 to 22 years. Four men with sporadic disease and 1 woman with a sister affected with adolescent-onset parkinsonism had similar initial treatment response, but developed "wearing-off" and a less satisfactory response to levodopa within the first few years of treatment. This indicates that some patients with clinical syndromes suggestive of DRD may not have an excellent prognosis on long-term levodopa treatment and may represent misclassified cases of childhood-onset parkinsonism. 
Characterization of estrogen receptor in human gastric cancer. Estrogen receptors (ER) were examined in cytosol, nuclear potassium chloride (KCl) extractable fraction, and nuclear KCl unextractable fraction by the dextran-coated charcoal adsorption method in various gastric cancer tissue. The overall ER-positive rate in the cytosol and nuclear fraction was 19.2%. The maximum binding site (Bmax) was 36.0 to 175.0 fmol/mg of protein, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.6 to 1.6 X 10(-9) in cytosol fraction. In the nuclear fraction, Bmax was 7.5 fmol/mg of DNA and Kd was 2.3 X 10(-9). Estrogen receptors were characterized in cytosol protein. In cytosol, the estrogen (E2)-ER complex was sedimented at approximately the 5S and 8S regions by 5% to 20% linear sucrose gradient centrifugation. A steroid specificity study of ER showed the presence of an binder in gastric cancer tissue. In conclusion, these results that gastric cancer tissue has E2 binding sites with the same biochemical characteristics as in breast cancer and endometrial cancer strongly suggest the hormonal dependency of gastric cancer. 
Anorectal varices--their frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Anorectal varices in portal hypertension have been little studied: Seventy eight per cent of 72 patients with portal hypertension had anorectal varices shown at flexible sigmoidoscopy. Significantly more patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension had these varices than patients with cirrhosis (89% v 56%, p less than 0.01). 
Jejunal biopsy in HIV-infected patients. Forty-nine HIV-infected patients were submitted to peroral jejunal biopsy in order to evaluate the presence of microorganisms and the histomorphometric aspects of the enteric mucosa with subsequent correlation of these findings to the appropriate clinical stage of the disease. Thirty-seven patients fulfilled the CDC criteria for AIDS, of whom 23 presented with diarrhea. Of the 12 patients who had not yet been given an AIDS diagnosis. 3 had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and 9 were asymptomatic carriers. Flat mucosa was observed in two patients (8.7%) with diarrhea and coccidea. Subtotal villous atrophy and severe lamina propria (LP) mononuclear infiltrate (13%) were found only in patients with diarrhea. Moderate to severe histologic changes were more frequently observed in this group, not always related to the presence of microorganisms. Crypt hyperregeneration was a constant finding. Intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count was decreased in patients with diarrhea. Specific infectious agents were unexpectedly rare for the tropical developing country population studied. The organism most commonly associated with diarrhea was Cryptosporidium sp. (21.7%). The etiology of diarrhea in a significant number of patients remains unclear. 
Surgical management of retinal detachment associated with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome. We operated on nine eyes in eight patients with retinal detachment associated with acute retinal necrosis (ARN) syndrome. The patients were treated with scleral buckling, vitreoretinal surgery, or a combination of these treatments. Vitrectomised eyes underwent combinations of lensectomy, membrane dissection, scleral buckling, air-fluid exchange, endolaser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and retinal tamponade with C3F8 gas or SF6 gas. Macular attachment was achieved in eight (89%) eyes. Vision improved in seven (78%) eyes, of which five (56%) achieved 20/200 or better vision. Three eyes that had received laser treatment posterior to areas of retinitis suffered retinal detachment despite this prophylactic treatment. Poor visual outcome resulted from viral infection of the optic nerve or macular involvement, macular hole formation, macular pucker, or hypotony. 
Differences in the use of procedures between women and men hospitalized for coronary heart disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Previous studies at individual hospitals have reported differences in the use of major diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for women and men with coronary heart disease. To assess whether these differences can be generalized, we performed retrospective analyses of coronary angiography and revascularization (coronary-artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) in women and men hospitalized for coronary heart disease in 1987, using abstract data on 49,623 discharges in Massachusetts and 33,159 discharges in Maryland. We used multiple logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds of the use of a procedure, controlling for principal diagnosis, age, secondary diagnosis of congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus, race, and insurance status. RESULTS. The adjusted odds of undergoing angiography were 28 percent and 15 percent higher for men than for women in Massachusetts and Maryland, respectively (95 percent confidence intervals for the odds ratios, 1.22 to 1.35 and 1.08 to 1.22). The respective adjusted odds of undergoing revascularization were 45 percent and 27 percent higher for men than for women (95 percent confidence intervals, 1.35 to 1.55 and 1.16 to 1.40). Because these differences could be related to differing thresholds for hospital admission, we performed a second analysis limited to patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction (11,865 discharges in Massachusetts and 6894 discharges in Maryland), a group in which all patients would be expected to receive hospital care. The male-to-female odds ratios in both states remained similar in magnitude and were statistically significant for angiography and revascularization. CONCLUSIONS. These findings demonstrate that women who are hospitalized for coronary heart disease undergo fewer major diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than men. These differences may represent appropriate levels of care for men and women, but it is also possible that they reflect underuse in women or overuse in men. Further study should assess the cause of these differences and their effect on patients' outcomes. 
Anterolateral transthoracic transvertebral resection of an intramedullary spinal arteriovenous malformation. Case report. The case is reported of a 16-year-old girl with an anterior thoracic spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM) who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and sudden change in lower-extremity strength. Spinal angiography revealed a Type II (glomus) intramedullary AVM at the T7-8 level fed by multiple branches of the anterior spinal artery. The AVM was successfully resected using an anterolateral transthoracic approach. The details of this approach and its use for surgery of anterior thoracic spine lesions are described. 
Fucosyltransferases: differential plasma and tissue alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. To determine whether abnormal metabolism of L-fucose in hepatocellular carcinoma is accompanied by alterations in the activities of fucosyltransferases, the latter were determined in plasma and liver tissue of patients with this disease and in cirrhotic and normal subjects. Activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases were all significantly greater in plasma from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma than in plasma from cirrhotic patients or normal subjects (p less than 0.025). The activity of each enzyme was dependent, to a similar extent, on Mn2+, Mg2+ and triton X-10, irrespective of the source, and all displayed pH optimums in the range of 7.5 to 8.0. In contrast, activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 fucosyltransferases were significantly lower (p less than 0.025) in homogenates prepared from tumorous liver tissue than in that prepared from nontumorous tissue from hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients, whereas for the alpha-6 enzyme the situation was reversed (typically, tumor tissue levels were 5 pmol/hr/mg; in nontumor tissue they were 2 pmol/hr/mg). Activities of galactosyl and mannosyltransferase in tumor tissue were greater in all cases than in nontumor cirrhotic tissue. Plasma fucosyltransferases are specifically elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma but different mechanisms appear to underlie the changes seen for alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Psychiatric aspects of chest pain in the emergency department. We estimate that a third of the patients who present to the ED with chest pain have a current psychiatric disorder and that psychiatric disorders among chest pain patients are associated with a high rate of ED utilization for chest pain evaluations. Physicians in the ED recognize only a small fraction of the psychiatric disorders, so appropriate treatment or referral may be infrequent. The proportion of chest pain patients with CAD who also have a psychiatric disorder may be in the range of 20% to 30%, justifying careful assessment of psychiatric disorders in CAD patients. We conclude that the psychiatric aspects of chest pain are sufficiently prevalent, clinically significant, and a contributor to unnecessarily high utilization of medical services. We call for clinical research to address these questions by outlining three areas of study that will advance our knowledge and care of the patient with chest pain. 
A prospective evaluation of intracoronary ethanol ablation of the atrioventricular conduction system. The clinical efficacy and complications associated with ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system by the selective infusion of ethanol into the AV node artery were prospectively assessed in 12 consecutive patients with medically refractory atrial arrhythmias. Six of the patients had previously failed to have permanent complete AV block created with direct current or radiofrequency catheter ablation. The AV node artery was cannulated with a 0.016 in. (0.041 cm) guide wire in all 12 patients. It was also possible to advance a 2.7F infusion catheter into the AV node artery in all patients. Transient AV block was induced by selective injections into the AV node artery of iced saline solution (8 patients) and of radiographic contrast agent (ioxaglate) (10 patients). The infusion of 2 ml of ethanol (96%) induced immediate complete AV block in all 10 patients who demonstrated AV block with ioxaglate. The escape rhythm exhibited a narrow QRS complex preceded by a His bundle deflection in nine patients and left bundle branch block in one patient. The immediate mean rate of the escape rhythm was 45.3 +/- 13.4 beats/min. In two patients who demonstrated reflux of contrast agent into the distal right coronary artery with selective injections into the AV node artery, transient ST segment elevation developed in the inferior electrocardiographic leads with the infusion of ethanol. There was no change in the left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value (0.53 +/- 0.12) to that measured after ablation (0.55 +/- 0.11) and no patient developed wall motion abnormalities. 
A carbon fiber implant to aid interbody lumbar fusion. Mechanical testing. A carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer implant has been designed to aid interbody lumbar fusion. The cage-like implant has ridges or teeth to resist pullout or retropulsion, struts to support weight bearing, and a hollow center for packing of autologous bone graft. Because carbon is radiolucent, bony healing can be imaged by standard radiographic techniques. The device has been mechanically tested in cadaver spines and compared with posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone. The carbon device required a pullout force of 353 N compared with 126 N for donor bone. In compression testing, posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with the carbon device bore a load of 5,288 N before failure of the vertebral bone. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone failed at 4,628 N, and unmodified motion segments failed at 6,043 N. The carbon fiber implant separates the mechanical and biologic functions of posterior lumbar interbody fusion. 
The effects of adenotonsillectomy on growth in young children. A history of poor weight gain can often be elicited in young children with chronic upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth. 
Emergency laryngectomy. From 1974 to 1990, 31 patients underwent emergency laryngectomy for airway obstruction due to laryngeal carcinoma, in an effort to avoid the complication of stomal recurrence. This group of patients had a greater proportion of multiregional tumours (35 per cent vs 13 per cent) than a comparison group of elective laryngectomies. In other respects the two groups were similar. Early post-operative mortality (6.5 per cent vs 3 per cent), stomal recurrence rates (4.2 per cent vs 4.8 per cent) and survival (53 per cent vs 55 per cent) were not significantly different between the emergency laryngectomy group and the comparison group undergoing elective laryngectomy. 
Evaluating quality, cost-effective health care. Vascular database predicated on hospital discharge abstracts. This population-based study examines all carotid endarterectomies (CE) performed by all surgeons in a single state over a 10-year period. The methodology is designed to determine morbidity rate, mortality rate, cost, and length of stay, as well as to understand the effect of pre-existing chronic disease, physician, and hospital volume on these outcome variables. The data source consisted of hospital discharge abstract data uniformly collected on all admissions (N = 5.9 million) to acute care hospitals in the state. In the decade 1979 to 1988, 11,199 patients underwent CE. Mortality rate from CE was 2.1%, and the postoperative stroke rate was 3.7% over this period. High physician volume decreased the mortality rate (p less than 0.05) and stroke rate (p less than 0.01) by 50% and significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced hospital cost and length of stay independent of patient complexity. Examination of cost data, adjusted for inflation, showed a decrease in mean cost for CE over the decade. Thus physicians are providing better care for less hospital dollars. Both patient and payor outcome is improved by concentrating CE patients in the hands of high-volume surgeons. Although the data suggests this trend is already evolving, the pace of this evolution can be expected to increase as payors recognize that regionalization of this procedure lowers costs. 
Necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum: unique case and review. The occasional pathogenicity of nondiphtheria corynebacteria in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals is now well established. Previously described sites of infection include heart valves, wounds, urinary tract, and lungs. This report of necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum illustrates the widening spectrum of infections caused by these organisms. A 54-year-old man developed respiratory distress and symptoms of upper airway obstruction unresponsive to inhaled bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, or intravenous erythromycin. A spirometry flow-volume loop demonstrated fixed upper airway obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed a circumferential inflammatory process partially occluding the tracheal lumen. Gram staining revealed gram-positive rods typical of corynebacteria, and cultures of tracheal tissue yielded C. pseudodiphtheriticum resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for exotoxin or cell-associated toxins. Treatment with intravenous penicillin resulted in resolution of the inflammatory process and eradication of the organisms, as assessed by subsequent cultures. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Same-day angioplasty and diagnostic catheterization: safe and effective but riskier in unstable angina. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed at the time of the diagnostic catheterization in 188 patients (215 lesions) at a University Hospital in order to assess the efficacy of this approach and the potential role it should play in the evaluation and treatment of patients. Patients either presented for diagnostic catheterization for evaluation of stable coronary disease (79 patients) or for unstable or new onset anginal symptoms (109 patients). Lesions were graded as to whether they were simple or complex; and post angioplasty films were reviewed for success rate, and degree of revascularization. Patients who were referred for stable anginal symptoms had a slightly higher success rate (91%) compared to those who were referred for new onset or more unstable symptomatology (85%, p = ns). Additionally, lesions morphology was judged to be more complex in unstable patients, as 67% had complex lesions with the presence of thrombus or ulcerated plaque in 56% of these stenoses. Angioplasty success was high for simple lesions in all patients, but was most unfavorable for complex stenoses in patients who presented with unstable symptoms (81% success rate). In patients who presented with new onset or unstable symptoms multivessel disease was present in 69% and angioplasty was more often geared at dilating a culprit stenosis leaving only 49% of these patients with complete revascularization. On the other hand, in 76% of those patients who presented with stable angina complete revascularization was a common outcome. Length of hospital stay was considerably shorter at 2.9 +/- 0.8 days in those patients who presented with stable symptoms. 
Neurohumoral activation in congestive heart failure. This article reviews the evidence that congestive heart failure is accompanied by an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration and that this is due not only to a reduced tissue clearance of the substance but also to a marked increase in sympathetic nerve activity. It also reports data that indicate that the sympathetic activation is associated with an activation of the renin-angiotensin system and an increased plasma level of vasopressin. At which degree of congestive heart failure these phenomena become manifest is not clear, but some studies suggest that the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems may be normal in asymptomatic congestive heart failure but already somewhat activated when this condition reaches New York Heart Association class II. There is also evidence that this activation, though initially compensatory, is eventually responsible for a number of adverse cardiovascular effects that account for the negative relationship between this event and survival. Finally, the article discusses the inability of the increased plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide that characterizes congestive heart failure to offset the adverse effects of the neurohumoral activation and the variable influence of drug treatment on this phenomenon. This is not impossible to achieve, however, because heart transplantation appears to rapidly normalize a major factor in the increased sympathetic activity observed before surgical intervention, that is, impairment of the arterial baroreflex. 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study design and baseline patient characteristics. ETDRS report number 7. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), a multicenter collaborative clinical trial supported by the National Eye Institute, was designed to assess whether argon laser photocoagulation or aspirin treatment can reduce the risk of visual loss or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The 3711 patients enrolled in the ETDRS were assigned randomly to either aspirin (650 mg per day) or placebo. One eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early argon laser photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation. Both eyes were to be examined at least every 4 months and photocoagulation was to be initiated in eyes assigned to deferral as soon as high-risk proliferative retinopathy was detected. Examination of a large number of baseline ocular and patient characteristics indicated that there were no important differences between randomized treatment groups at baseline. 
Clinical efficacy of sucralfate in the treatment of gastric ulcer. We performed a randomized, single-blind study in Japan to investigate the efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens of sucralfate granules, 2 g, twice daily (b.i.d. group, n = 30) and 1 g, 4 times daily (q.i.d. group, n = 27), on ulcer healing in 57 patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer. Endoscopy was performed after 4 weeks and, if complete healing was not achieved, again after an additional 4 weeks. Of 57 patients, 11 were excluded from the statistical analysis because of protocol violation (six in b.i.d. group, five in q.i.d. group). Of 46 patients eligible for the analysis of healing rates, four patients in the b.i.d. group (all at 8 weeks) and five patients in the q.i.d. group (two at 4 weeks and three at 8 weeks) were withdrawn due to patients' inconvenience. As the possibility that the withdrawals were due to the treatment failures could not be denied, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and generalized Wilcoxon test/logrank test for the calculation and evaluation of healing rates in this study, respectively. Healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were 50% and 94% in the b.i.d. group and 35% and 68% in the q.i.d. group. There was no significant difference in healing rates between the groups. No serious adverse effect was observed in either group. These results suggest that the 2 g b.i.d. dose of sucralfate in granule form is at least as effective as the conventional dose of 1 g q.i.d. in the treatment of active gastric ulcers and could lead to better patient compliance. 
Vasospasm in a coronary artery aneurysm. Coronary artery aneurysms are not believed to have enough intact smooth muscle to generate significant vasoconstriction. A case is presented illustrating vasospasm of a large fusiform aneurysm of a right coronary artery during angioplasty. Pathophysiology of aneurysms is discussed. 
A case of intracerebral air embolism secondary to the insertion of a Hickman line. Complications following the insertion of intravenous catheters are relatively uncommon. We report a potentially serious, hitherto unrecognized complication of Hickman line insertion, and discuss the condition. 
Difficult pediatric diagnoses. Bruising and bleeding [published erratum appears in Pediatr Clin North Am 1991 Oct;38(5):viii] An approach to the evaluation of a child who presents to the pediatrician with bruising is outlined. Important clues in the history and physical examination that suggest disorders of platelet number and function or coagulation abnormalities are presented. A scheme for using screening tests of coagulation and platelet function is followed by a brief summary of currently available therapies appropriate for bleeding episodes in children. 
Clinical and financial audit of diagnostic protocols for lesions of the cerebellopontine angle OBJECTIVE--To assess the diagnostic efficiency and costs of protocols used for investigating patients with suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle. DESIGN--Prospective evaluation of tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds, electronystagmography, and calorics. Positive test results were confirmed or refuted by high resolution computed tomography with intravenous enhancement. SETTING--Single general otolaryngology clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--270 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss requiring investigation to exclude a lesion of the cerebellopontine angle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Estimated costs of various diagnostic protocols and performance in detecting tumours of the cerebellopontine angle. RESULTS--Protocols including tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds as sifting tests before computed tomography were clinically acceptable and presented considerable savings over the use of computed tomography in all patients (74,000 pounds or 84,000 pounds v 122,000 pounds). The use of electronystagmography and calorics could not be justified on clinical or financial grounds. CONCLUSIONS--Audiological tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds followed by computed tomography constitute the most cost effective protocol for determining suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle. IMPLICATIONS--The cost effectiveness of diagnostic protocols should be evaluated throughout the health service. 
Acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis in a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension treated by both epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and nitroprusside. A 19-year-old girl was diagnosed as having primary pulmonary hypertension that was confirmed by right heart catheterization. Acute right heart failure was associated with syncope. Stabilization, while not achieved with intravenous epoprostenol (Prostacyclin) alone, was achieved with intravenous prostacyclin and nitroprusside. 
The treatment of ankle valgus by surface epiphysiodesis. Progressive ankle valgus in childhood requiring surgical correction is usually because of paralytic disease or conditions that produce a short distal fibula such as multiple exostoses or both. Surface epiphysiodesis of the distal medial tibial physis was used to correct valgus deformity in ten ankles in seven patients. This procedure has been found to be a simple and effective method of treatment. Measurement of the degree of valgus and calculation of the remaining growth of the distal tibial physis are recommended to determine whether this procedure will be effective. It is most often indicated in the presence of moderate valgus in children aged 11 to 14 years. 
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in obstructive apnea. Value of preoperative localization of site of upper airway narrowing during sleep. We hypothesized that those obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with upper airway collapse during sleep within the transpalatal airway would have a more favorable response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPP) than those patients with obstruction within the hypopharyngeal airway. We tested this hypothesis in seven OSA patients with transpalatal and seven with hypopharyngeal obstruction undergoing UPP. Preoperatively the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was different between palatal and hypopharyngeal obstructors, 37.8 +/- 6.0 (+/- SEM) and 63.9 +/- 6.3, respectively (p less than 0.05), but the apnea-associated arterial oxygen desaturation and the lowest sleep saturation level were not different between the two groups. Postoperatively the AHI was 17.6 +/- 7.2 in the palatal obstructors and 40.3 +/- 15.6 in the hypopharyngeal obstructors (both p less than 0.05 from preoperative AHI). The palatal obstructors had a significant decrease in the percentage of sleep time spent apneic and the hypopharyngeal obstructors had a significant decrease in the hypopnea, but not apnea, time following surgery. The palatal obstructors had a significantly higher postoperative arterial oxygen saturation than the hypopharyngeal obstructors. Two hypopharyngeal obstructors worsened postoperatively. In addition we found that regardless of the site of the obstruction preoperatively, all obstructions occurred at the level of the palate postoperatively. We conclude that patients with preoperative transpalatal obstruction had diminution in obstructive apneas and those with hypopharyngeal obstruction had diminution in hypopneas but not apneas. Oxygenation was better postoperatively in the palatal obstructors, and none worsened postoperatively. These results suggest that identification of the site of upper airway obstruction in OSA may be beneficial. 
A rare complication of mitral valve replacement. Intraoperative fracture of the right fibrous trigone following a superior approach to the left atrium. Case report. A rare complication of mitral valve replacement is reported. Following a superior approach, through the roof of the left atrium the mitral valve was replaced with a Bjork-Shiley prosthesis in a 52-year-old female, who had undergone previous closed commissurotomy. Fracture of the right fibrous trigone occurred at surgery, following the completion of mitral valve replacement. The lesion was successfully repaired on cardiopulmonary bypass under cardioplegic arrest, placing sutures, after an oblique aortotomy, from below the noncoronary aortic cusp. The postoperative course was uneventful, without occurrence of a-v block. We believe that a superior approach to the left atrium may be a valid alternative for mitral valve surgery in some selected cases. 
Primary embryonal-cell carcinoma of the parietal lobe. Case report. A case of primary embryonal-cell carcinoma of the parietal lobe is reported. The unusually chronic presentation of such a malignant tumor is described. The atypical computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of this lesion are presented. Review of the literature yielded no previous reports of a lobar embryonal-cell carcinoma. The rarity of intracranial germ-cell tumors presenting off the midline is discussed. 
The role of enhanced vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia: pharmacologic basis of inefficiency. The effects of pharmacologic modulation of vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 21 conscious dogs after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. Studies were done on spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 383 +/- 100 msec, n = 21), 24 to 72 hours after LAD occlusion, and on inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 251 +/- 30 msec, n = 6), 4 to 7 days after LAD occlusion. Edrophonium (1 mg/kg intravenously), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and methacholine (0.1 to 1 mg intravenously), a muscarinic agonist, had no significant effect on the rate or QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia, despite severe slowing of the sinoatrial rate. Similarly, atropine (up to 60 micrograms/kg intravenously) had no effect on the rate and QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia. In an attempt to enhance myocardial drug delivery to the ischemic and infarcted left ventricle, edrophonium (1 mg/kg) and methacholine (0.1 to 0.2 mg) were injected retrogradely through the great cardiac vein. This did not impart any significant therapeutic advantage over the systemic intravenous route. Sympathetic beta blockade did not affect the therapeutic outcome (n = 5) with either edrophonium or methacholine. It is concluded that direct or indirect enhancement of cardiac vagal activity has no effect on ischemic ventricular tachycardia in this model of subacute myocardial infarction. The lack of efficacy appears to be independent of myocardial drug delivery to ischemic ventricular site(s) and background sympathetic activity. Such a lack of efficacy may be caused by ischemia-mediated degeneration of vagal nerve terminals, by altered responsiveness of muscarinic receptors at infarcted arrhythmogenic myocardial sites, or both. 
Conventional MR neuroangiography. MR angiography of the brain plays an important role in the diagnosis of vessel thrombosis and dissection, giant aneurysms, and occult vascular malformations. This essay highlights some of the features of the intra- and extracranial circulation that make conventional MR neuroangiography valuable in the demonstration of vascular anatomy and vascular disease. 
Comparative study of glass and antimony electrodes for continuous oesophageal pH monitoring. Oesophageal pH monitoring data are influenced by numerous patient or technique related factors, or both. In this study, data recorded with glass microelectrodes or antimony electrodes, both with external cutaneous Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, connected to two different recording devices are compared. Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH less than 4) ranged from poor to excellent (0.55 to 1.00). Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r:0.93 to 1.00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0.90). Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor (0.55 to 0.70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes. The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes. 
Surgical pathology of gastrinoma. Site, size, multicentricity, association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and malignancy. Specimens from the pancreas and duodenum of 26 patients with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and 18 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and hypergastrinemia (17 with ZES) were screened immunocytochemically for gastrinomas. Location, size, multicentricity, and malignancy of the gastrinomas were evaluated. The MEN-1 patients had gastrinomas in the duodenum (nine of 18), pancreas (one of 18), and periduodenal lymph nodes (two of 18). No gastrinoma was identified in six patients. Most duodenal gastrinomas were multiple (five of nine) and smaller than 0.6 cm (six of nine). Lymph node metastases were present in eight of 12 patients. All 26 patients with sporadic ZES had a solitary gastrinoma; 14 were found in the pancreas and had a diameter greater than 2 cm. Ten patients had a duodenal gastrinoma, two with a diameter less than 0.6 cm. In two patients, only periduodenal "lymph node gastrinomas" were detected. Eighteen of the sporadic gastrinomas were malignant. These results suggest that duodenal location and multicentricity of gastrinomas are associated with the MEN-1 syndrome, and solitary gastrinomas, either in the pancreas or the duodenum, are predominantly seen in sporadic ZES. 
Relative effects of diarrhea, fever, and dietary energy intake on weight gain in rural Bangladeshi children. Quantitative studies of morbidity, food intake, and somatic growth were done prospectively during 14 mo for 70 children aged 5-18 mo in two Bangladeshi villages. When random-effect regression models were used, monthly changes in weight were inversely related to proportions of days in the month with fever and diarrhea and positively related to energy intake per kilogram body weight. Interestingly, weight changes did not vary with age in this interval. Estimates indicate that increasing energy intakes to the recommended World Health Organization level would have a significantly greater effect on weight gain than would the elimination of diarrhea and fever. With energy at recommended intake and diarrhea and fever prevalence as found in US children, weight gain is predicted to be near that of the international reference population. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving dietary intake may be as important as infection-control programs for improving growth of children in poor developing nations. 
Central retinal vein occlusion associated with drusen of the optic disc. A 43-year-old man had gradual visual changes OD. Funduscopic examination revealed central retinal vein occlusion OD. Complete ocular examination revealed bilateral drusen of the optic disc, confirmed by b-scan ultrasonography. Complete systemic evaluation showed no other etiology for the central retinal vein occlusion. Over a ten-year follow-up, in the absence of systemic disease or other local ocular anomalies, we concluded that central retinal vein occlusion can arise from external compression secondary to drusen of the optic disc. 
A method for allocation of hearing handicap. A three-stage method is proposed for allocation of hearing handicap. First, for a given injury or noise exposure period, the percentage of loss allocable for each ear is calculated as a simple ratio of hearing change (after age correction) to final hearing level. Second, final hearing handicap is divided between the two ears using a formula derived from the 1979 AAO-HNS/AMA standard. The percentage of hearing handicap allocable to a given period for each ear is simply the product of that ear's scores from the first two steps. 
Acceleration of chronic myeloid leukemia correlates with calcitonin gene hypermethylation. Calcitonin gene methylation at CCGG sites were determined in 39 chronic myeloid leukemia patients by isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease analysis. A total of 27 patients were analyzed while still in the chronic phase: 20 patients had a normal gene, and seven had a hypermethylated gene. There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes. The results suggest that the assessment of calcitonin gene methylation status may be a promising tool for monitoring chronic myeloid leukemia disease escalation. 
Single photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. 
Clinical pharmacology of calcium antagonists. There have been major advances in the understanding of the basic pharmacology of drugs acting upon voltage-dependent and receptor-activated calcium channels using patch-clamp techniques. The structure of the L channel is known and the (different) binding sites for various calcium antagonists have been identified using the methods of molecular biology. Although calcium slow-channel antagonists are very widely used in the treatment of hypertension, advances in the clinical pharmacology of angina and, to a lesser extent, cardiac arrhythmias, have not kept up with the basic research in molecular biology. All of the calcium antagonists in current use dilate arteries, and their therapeutic action largely depends on this property. There is evidence of differences in response between arteries and veins, and some degree of selectivity between vascular territories, but the goal of much more specific or localized vasodilation has not been achieved. The most prominent difference between the three main classes of antihypertensive drugs is the mild reflex increase of heart rate seen with the dihydropyridines and the bradycardia seen with verapamil. Most of the side effects of calcium antagonists are also based on vasodilatation, such as flushing and headache. The mild edema often seen with the dihydropyridines probably depends on the changes in capillary pressure brought about by arterial dilatation. Despite their undoubted efficacy as vasodilators, there are no studies thus far which allow any conclusions as to the long-term effect of calcium antagonists on the morbidity and mortality due to hypertension. 
Efficient immortalization of luminal epithelial cells from human mammary gland by introduction of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen with a recombinant retrovirus. When defined in terms of markers for normal cell lineages, most invasive breast cancer cells correspond to the phenotype of the common luminal epithelial cell found in the terminal ductal lobular units. Luminal epithelial cells cultured from milk, which have limited proliferative potential, have now been immortalized by introducing the gene encoding simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen. Infection with a recombinant retrovirus proved to be 50-100 times more efficient than calcium phosphate transfection, and of the 17 cell lines isolated, only 5 passed through a crisis period as characterized by cessation of growth. When characterized by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies, 14 lines showed features of luminal epithelial cells and of these, 7 resembled the common luminal epithelial cell type in the profile of keratins expressed. These cells express keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19 homogeneously and do not express keratin 14 or vimentin; a polymorphic epithelial mucin produced in vivo by luminal cells is expressed heterogeneously and the pattern of fibronectin staining is punctate. Although the cell lines have a reduced requirement for added growth factors, they do not grow in agar or produce tumors in the nude mouse. When the v-Ha-ras oncogene was introduced into two of the cell lines by using a recombinant retrovirus, most of the selected clones senesced, but one entered crisis and emerged after 3 months as a tumorigenic cell line. 
Effects of variable dose milrinone in patients with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. European Multicenter Trial Group. We studied 99 adult patients after elective cardiac surgery who had low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.5 L/min/m2) in spite of adequate cardiac filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 8 mm Hg). Patients received milrinone by loading dose (50 micrograms/kg over a 10-minute period), followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.375, 0.5, or 0.75 micrograms/kg/min (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) given for a minimum of 12 hours. Patients were allocated to each dosage group sequentially, not randomly. Hemodynamic measurements were made before the loading dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the start of milrinone therapy. Further measurements were made at 2 and 4 hours after treatment was stopped. Milrinone therapy was associated with a rapid, well-sustained, and highly significant increase in cardiac index in all three dose groups (p less than 0.001), and a similar fall occurred in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in all groups (p less than 0.001). Significant increases occurred in heart rate in all three groups (p less than 0.001). Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also fell significantly, although changes in this latter parameter were less predictable and more dose dependent. Few serious treatment-related adverse effects were seen. We conclude that intravenous milrinone is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of low output states after cardiac surgery. 
Biomechanical changes at the ankle joint after stroke. The resistance of the relaxed ankle to slow displacement over the joint movement range was measured on both sides of a group of hemiparetic stroke patients, in whom spasticity had been established for at least one year and who showed no clinical signs of contractures. The ankle joints of the age-matched normal subjects were flexible over most of the movement range, showing dramatically increasing stiffness only when the foot was dorsiflexed beyond 70 degrees, with a neutral range between 90-100 degrees, and a less dramatic increase in stiffness during plantarflexion. Hemiparetic patients showed identical curves to the normal subjects on the "healthy" side, ipsilateral to the causative cerebral lesion, but were significantly stiffer in dorsiflexion on the contralateral side, without change in the minimum stiffness range or during plantarflexion. Therefore significant changes in passive biomechanical properties occur at the affected ankle of hemiparetic subjects, predominantly as the result of a loss of compliance in the Achilles tendon, although an increase in the passive stiffness of the triceps surae may also occur. The contribution of these changes to the locomotor disability of hemiparetic patients is discussed. 
Abnormalities of the foot in patients with diabetes mellitus: findings on MR imaging. The MR appearances of foot problems in patients with diabetes mellitus are illustrated. MR has been found to be effective in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, the most common indication for imaging the feet of diabetic patients. MR has the ability to image numerous pathologic processes, especially subtle soft-tissue changes, that are not detectable with other imaging methods. 
Neurologic aspects of cobalamin deficiency. We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single patient. In 42 (27.4%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 (23.0%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients responded, and in 57 (47.1%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50% or greater after treatment in 91% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3%) episodes. The extent of neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the first 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Mortality in a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy: an updated analysis. OBJECTIVE--To reexamine the mortality experience of a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in comparison with that reported previously for the same cohort of women, paying particular attention to cardiovascular mortality, deaths from breast and endometrial cancer, and deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. DESIGN--Longitudinal cohort of 4544 long-term users of HRT amongst whom mortality is being monitored prospectively in comparison with expected rates in the female population of England and Wales (taking account of age and calendar period). SUBJECTS--4544 women, all of whom were recruited from specialist menopause clinics around Britain and had taken at least one year's continuous HRT at the time of recruitment to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, deaths from female cancers, deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. RESULTS--Overall mortality (based on 236 deaths over the entire study period from recruitment to December 1988) remained significantly lower than expected on the basis of national rates (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.47-0.66). When specific causes were considered, the only mortality ratios greater than unity were for injury, poisoning and violence (1.54, 95% CL 1.02-2.06), and for suicide and suspected suicide ('suicide') (2.40, 95% CL 1.68-3.11). Comparison of the ratios for the 112 additional deaths with those obtained in our previous analysis revealed that one of the few ratios to show any increase was that for breast cancer mortality. This rose from a significant deficit of 0.55 (95% CL 0.28-0.96) in the earlier period to 1.00 (95% CL 0.55-1.45) in the later period. There was also a suggestion of an increase in breast cancer risk with increasing duration since first use of HRT. Most of the other cause-specific ratios were very similar over the two periods. The ratio of death from all circulatory diseases was notably lower in the later analysis (RR 0.37, 95% CL 0.15-0.58) than in the earlier analysis (0.51, 95% CL 0.36-0.69), as were all of the subcategories of cardiovascular death. The mortality ratio for cancer of the ovary and uterine adnexa fell from 1.12 in the previous analysis to 0.63 (95% CL 0-1.41). The mortality ratio for 'suicide' also decreased, but was only slightly lower in the later period. As before, however, there was evidence of a relatively high prevalence of prior psychiatric problems amongst the recent 'suicide' deaths, suggesting that the excess of deaths from 'suicide' may be a manifestation of selection. CONCLUSION--These data are consistent with a beneficial effect of HRT on cardiovascular diseases, although updated information comparing progestogen-opposed and -unopposed treatment is not available. The increase in breast cancer mortality contrasts with the pattern for all other specific causes examined; taken together with the suggestion of an increase in breast cancer mortality with increasing interval since first exposure to HRT, this finding is somewhat worrying. 
Hereditary hyperparathyroidism and multiple ossifying jaw fibromas: a clinically and genetically distinct syndrome. A large previously reported family with hyperparathyroidism has been reinvestigated recently because of the occurrence of multiple ossifying jaw fibromas in two affected members of the third generation similar to the jaw tumors of four of five affected members of the first generation. These maxillary and mandibular tumors can be differentiated from the "brown tumors" of hyperparathyroidism because they can appear and enlarge even though the hypercalcemia is surgically corrected. These tumors are histologically distinct fibroosseous lesions without the giant cells seen in "brown tumors." The parathyroid enlargement was mostly uniglandular, with multiple tumors found occasionally. Studies in DNA linkage were performed within this large family and a similar family in Houston to determine if the gene for this syndrome, termed HRPT2, is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 11, to which the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 has been linked. (This linkage is supported by our findings in one family with MEN 1 reported here.) Linkage studies were also performed with markers on chromosome 10, to which the genes for MEN 2A and MEN 2B have been linked. Evidence against close linkage with chromosome 10 and chromosome 11 markers suggests that this clinically distinct syndrome is also genetically distinct. 
Association of a precore genomic variant of hepatitis B virus with fulminant hepatitis. A variant of hepatitis B virus has been described recently in HBsAg+ Mediterranean patients who lack HBeAg and who have an unusual and severe form of chronic hepatitis. This variant is unable to produce HBeAg because of the presence of a novel translational stop codon at the end of the precore region of the genome. By direct sequencing of DNA, generated by the polymerase chain reaction, we have evaluated the association between infection with this variant and the fulminant course of hepatitis B. Eighteen patients with fulminant hepatitis B were studied. Of the 15 cases from whose serum viral DNA could be sequenced, the variant was found in the admission sera of 8 of 9 HBeAg- patients but in none of 6 HBeAg+ patients who had fulminant hepatitis B. Patients harboring the variant progressed more rapidly into hepatic encephalopathy, but those infected with the variant strain alone had a greater likelihood of survival than those infected with the normal strain or a mixture. The mutant strain may emerge spontaneously during fulminant hepatitis as occurs in chronic hepatitis B infection during seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody. Alternately, and perhaps less commonly, patients may be infected with the variant ab initio. 
Accidental and intentional poisonings with ethylene glycol in infancy: diagnostic clues and management. Ethylene glycol has long been recognized as a potentially lethal poison and remains available today as automotive antifreeze and windshield deicer fluids. Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak levels measured one to four hours after ingestion. Metabolism of the parent compound and the production of several organic acids are responsible for the metabolic acidosis observed in ethylene glycol poisoning. Target organ cellular damage is seen in the kidney, brain, myocardium, pancreas, and blood vessel walls. Renal tubular deposition of calcium oxalate crystals is felt to be responsible for the development of the severe renal injury which may accompany ethylene glycol ingestion. The clinical course is quite varied and includes inebriation, hematuria, cardiorespiratory compromise, and neurologic effects. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment, including ethanol therapy and hemodialysis, is necessary to ameliorate the effects of ethylene glycol ingestion. Two cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, one accidental and one intentional, are reviewed. 
Psychological events are both risk factors in, and consequences of, chronic pain. This study questioned 2 assumptions often inherent in psychogenic explanations of pain: (1) that a relationship exists between pain and life events predating pain onset, and (2) that pain patients are a psychologically homogeneous group. Chronic pain sufferers in multiple settings and control subjects participated in this study in which the relationships between pain and 20 psychological variables were examined. Pain was defined and assessed in 3 different ways: (1) membership in a pain group, (2) number of specialists consulted for pain, and (3) pain intensity. Of the 20 psychological variables examined, only less emotional repression and greater "ergomania" (excessive work) were consistently associated with pain on all 3 pain criteria. In addition, pain patients were more likely to have had a relative with pain. Comparisons of pain patients in different settings showed that pain clinic patients reported having been more active throughout their lives, but were currently more depressed and experienced less life satisfaction than patients who were not in a specialized pain centre. These results are interpreted in the light of current multicausal views of pain and conclusions are drawn about the role of psychological variables both as risk factors in, and as consequences of pain. 
Modulation of alpha smooth muscle actin and desmin expression in perisinusoidal cells of normal and diseased human livers. It has been suggested that perisinusoidal liver cells (PSC) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive changes. Using light and electron microscopic immunolocalization techniques, a series of 207 normal and pathologic human liver specimens were evaluated for the expression of alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin and desmin in this and other nonparenchymal cell types. In normal adult liver tissue, PSCs were practically devoid of desmin and exceptionally stained for alpha-SM actin, whereas this actin isoform frequently was encountered in PSCs from the embryonic to the adolescent period. A broad spectrum of pathologic conditions was accompanied by the presence of alpha-SM actin containing PSCs; these were detected preferentially in periportal or perivenular zones according to the predominant location of the underlying hepatocellular damage. The occurrence of this PSC phenotype generally was associated with fibrogenesis and was in some cases detected earlier than overt collagen accumulation. Fibrous bands subdividing liver tissue in cirrhosis and focal nodular hyperplasia, as well as desmoplastic reaction to malignant tumors, contained alpha-SM actin-rich cells admixed with variable proportions of cells coexpressing desmin. In end stages, this population was less numerous than in active fibrotic or cirrhotic processes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, alpha-SM actin was localized in microfilament bundles of typical PSCs. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the appearance of alpha-SM actin and desmin-expressing myofibroblasts results at least in part from a phenotypic modulation of PSCs. 
Long term reduction in sodium balance: possible additional mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure OBJECTIVE--To assess the changes in sodium excretion and sodium balance after withdrawal of long term nifedipine. DESIGN--Single blind, placebo controlled study in patients receiving fixed sodium and potassium intakes. SETTING--Blood pressure unit of a teaching hospital in south London. PATIENTS--Eight patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension who had been taking nifedipine 20 mg twice daily for at least six weeks. INTERVENTIONS--Withdrawal of nifedipine and replacement with matching placebo for one week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urinary sodium excretion and cumulative sodium balance, body weight, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations, and blood pressure. RESULTS--During nifedipine withdrawal there was a significant reduction in urinary sodium excretion (day 1: -62.7 mmol/24 h; 95% confidence interval -90.3 to -35.0) and each patient retained a mean of 146 (SEM 26) mmol sodium over the week of replacement with placebo. Body weight and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations increased during the placebo period and seemed to be associated with the amount of sodium retained. Systolic blood pressure rose from 157 (9) to 165 (9) mmHg (95% confidence interval of difference -7.1 to 22.1) when nifedipine was replaced with matching placebo, and the rise seemed to be related to the amount of sodium that was retained. CONCLUSIONS--Nifedipine causes a long term reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension. This long term effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure. 
Distribution of porfiromycin in EMT6 solid tumors and normal tissues of BALB/c mice. The distribution of porfiromycin was studied in BALB/c mice bearing EMT6 mammary tumors. The levels of 3H in blood and most tissues peaked approximately 15 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of [3H]porfiromycin. The levels of radioactivity present in most of the tissues and in the tumors were similar at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration. Most of the normal tissues showed uniform, low grain densities when analyzed by autoradiography; the liver and the small intestine had the highest labeling densities. Only kidney, bladder, and tumor showed differential distributions of grains from [3H]porfiromycin. In the kidney, higher grain counts were found in cortex than in medullary regions; grains were uniformly distributed within each region. In the bladder, the highest labeling densities were found in regions near the lumen. Tumor regions that had some necrotic features or regions of necrosis that included some viable cells showed higher labeling intensities than healthy-looking tumor regions, probably because the abnormal microenvironments in these regions led to increased rates of activation of porfiromycin to electrophilic species. These findings show that porfiromycin can reach and be activated in tumor regions containing cells resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents and to x rays. The results also support the concept that agents such as porfiromycin can target cells in specific microenvironmental subpopulations of solid tumors. 
Electrophysiologic study in acute lead poisoning. A 2-month-old girl with acute lead poisoning demonstrated electrophysiologic evidence of neurotoxicity. Motor nerve conduction studies of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves revealed both axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potential studies of median and posterior tibial nerves demonstrated evidence of cortical involvement. Brainstem auditory evoked potential study disclosed the possibility of acoustic nerve involvement but no evidence of a brainstem lesion. Postmortem examination revealed cerebral edema and focal segmental demyelination of the median nerve. 
Pericardial cyst with partial erosion of the right ventricular wall. A case of pericardial cyst with partial erosion into the anterior wall of the right ventricle is presented. Cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary for excision of the cyst. This report helps to alert surgeons of the possible need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the removal of some pericardial cysts, especially in patients with signs and symptoms of infection and in whom preoperative imaging fails to show distinct margins between the cyst and cardiac structures. 
Current perception threshold screening for carpal tunnel syndrome. Screening for the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which is associated with excess ergonomic stresses of the wrist and hand, is a major concern in occupational medicine. CTS questionnaires, physical examinations, and quantitative sensory function determination through neuroselective current perception threshold (CPT) measurements were obtained from the median digital nerves of 16 assembly line workers who were symptomatic with hand pain. Median nerve evaluations by CPT detected sensory abnormalities in 75% of the workers, and abnormalities in 50% of the workers were detected by clinical evaluations (p less than .05, df = 22). CPT abnormalities were characterized as "hypoesthetic" in 25% and hyperesthesic in 42% of the workers. The noninvasive, nonaversive CPT technique provided sensitive and easily obtained quantitative measures. Regular use of this procedure in the occupational setting may assist in preventing the development of advanced CTS for it provides early detection of median nerve abnormalities. 
Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): comparison with Ph+ CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique. To better understand the Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its relationships with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a study was undertaken by the Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique. Thirty-five Ph- CML patients were investigated and compared with 55 chronic phase Ph+ CML and 100 CMML patients. There were 12 M-BCR positive (M-BCR+) and 23 M-BCR negative (MBCR+) patients. No clinical or biologic differences were found between Ph+ and Ph-, M-BCR+ patients. In the Ph- group, M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients differed significantly in age (47.7 +/- 6.6 v 67.0 +/- 6.1 years, respectively; P = .001), leukocytosis (153.4 +/- 135.1 v 58.5 +/- 37.7 10(9)/L, P = .002), relative monocytosis (1.8% +/- 1.2% v 5.6% +/- 1.4%, P = .048), absolute basophilia (8.5 +/- 9.7 v 0.9 +/- 1.5 10(9)/L, P = .001), percentage of immature myeloid precursors (IMP) in peripheral blood (29.0% +/- 9.5% v 15.3% +/- 8.1%, P = .001), and percentage of erythroblasts in bone marrow (BM) (6.5% +/- 3.5% v 14.6% +/- 3.6%, P = .001). Karyotypic abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome occurred in 0 of 12 M-BCR- at diagnosis and 7 of 23 M-BCR- Ph- CML (P = .033). None of the 13 investigated BCR- patients had detectable BCR/ABL transcripts using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and none had an N-RAS mutation. Cytologic findings showed a marked morphologic difference between M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients, especially in the monocytic lineage. Dysmyelopoietic features in CMML and M-BCR- patients were very similar, and the differences were of quantitative order only. Using four criteria (monocytosis, percentage of IMP, basophilia, and percentage of erythroblasts in BM), patients could be divided into typical and atypical CML and this classification correlated well with molecular findings. We conclude that, while Ph-, M-BCR+, and Ph+ CML are identical diseases, Ph-, M-BCR- CML, and CMML have many similarities and might be only different aspects of a same entity. 
Effect of cisapride on chronic idiopathic constipation in children. The efficacy of cisapride, a new prokinetic drug, as a treatment for chronic functional constipation of childhood was studied in 20 constipated children. Each subject had a stool frequency less than 4/week and/or total gastrointestinal transit time greater than 33 hr and was randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either cisapride (N = 10) or placebo (N = 10) for 12 weeks. Stool habits, total gastrointestinal transit time, and anorectal motility were evaluated in all children before and at the end of the treatment period. Cisapride significantly increased stool frequency from 1.2 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 1.9 stools/week (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05), whereas the lesser effect of placebo was not significant (1.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.8 +/- 0.8 stools/week; P = 0.4). Both treatments significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased laxative or suppository use. Total gastrointestinal transit time was decreased by cisapride (90.8 +/- 9.2 hr to 57.2 +/- 20.2 hr; P less than 0.05) but was not affected by placebo. Anorectal manometry showed that cisapride, but not placebo, significantly decreased the rectoanal inhibitory reflex threshold and the conscious rectal sensitivity threshold. It is concluded that cisapride improves gastrointestinal motility and bowel habits in children with chronic idiopathic constipation and may be useful in the management of some children with this disorder. 
Procurement and transplantation of colonized cadaver skin. Cadaver skin is an important adjunct to burn care. This study was designed to measure the percentage of its contamination prior to grafting and to determine the clinical safety of its use. Cadaveric homografts from 19 donors were harvested, frozen, thawed, and used as a biological dressing. Cultures were obtained at the time of harvest, after incubation in antibiotics, and at actual transplantation. The homografts were 43 per cent, 68 per cent, and 50 per cent contaminant-free, respectively. Two of 14 patients lost their homografts due to infection. However, no patient developed an infection or lost the homograft due to an organism identified during the pretransplantation processing. Therefore, contaminant-free and slightly contaminated cadaver skin can be used safely as homografts. 
Studies in autotomy: its pathophysiology and usefulness as a model of chronic pain. An interesting behavioral syndrome results in animals from the same or similar types of lesions that lead to deafferentation pain in humans; many neurectomized animals begin to scratch, bite, or self-mutilate their denervated limb, a phenomenon termed autotomy. The proposition that this behavior in animals is a response to the chronic pain of peripheral nerve injury has met with considerable controversy. If this issue were resolved, then a better understanding of the neurophysiology of autotomy might help elucidate the mechanisms of the human conditions. To determine the association between deafferentation and the autotomy behavior, we developed a pharmacologically induced functional deafferentation preparation using chronic perineural lidocaine infusion of the sciatic nerve. This 'chronic lidocaine' model's behavior was compared with that of the neurectomy model. While autotomy was noted in 80% of the latter group, no animal undergoing a chronic perineural infusion of lidocaine autotomized. We thus conclude that autotomy is not a response to non-painful sensory deafferentation, but rather that this behavior is a response to pain. We also studied the development of autotomy in a variety of other focal denervation preparations. On the basis of these data, we conclude that autotomy is not due to loss of sensory input on a functional basis nor to an action potential-mediated process. Rather, nerve damage which coincidentally involves sensory loss is necessary and sufficient for the development of this behavior. We suggest that interruption of a humoral feedback process homeostatically operating within the first order sensory neuron with its effect exerted post-synaptically leads to autotomy. The evidence supports the existence of a loss of a transportable, humoral autotomy inhibitory factor. 
Thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: a French collaborative study. A retrospective study was undertaken of 120 children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) seen in Paris and its immediate suburbs who fulfilled at least four of the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE, and in whom the disease was diagnosed before the age of 16 and between January 1975 and December 1987. Eleven of these children (eight girls and three boys) all more than 10 years of age (mean follow up 8.1 years; range 3-13) had thrombotic episodes (9%). Thrombosis was one of the presenting signs in seven patients; in five it was associated with typical symptoms of SLE, and in the other two the thrombotic episode was isolated and diagnosis of SLE was delayed one and three years. Of a total of 16 thrombotic episodes (six of which were recurrent), 14 involved the leg veins, and in four there was associated pulmonary embolism. There were two episodes that affected cerebral arteries. The American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE as well as the incidence of lupus anticoagulant, positive direct Coombs test, and vasculitis in this group of patients was compared with the incidence in patients with SLE but no thrombosis. Only lupus anticoagulant was significantly associated with thrombotic episodes: eight of 11 (73%) of patients with SLE and thrombotic (arterial or venous) episodes had lupus anticoagulant compared with only 10 of 74 patients (14%) with no history of thrombotic events in the same age group. 
Stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and vasopressin during retrograde mitral valvuloplasty. Acute mitral obstruction may lead to an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) due to increased atrial pressure and a large increase in arginine vasopressin (AVP) due to simultaneous arterial and ventricular baroreceptor unloading. We measured ANP and AVP concentration after transseptal puncture and during percutaneous retrograde mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PRMV) in 11 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years; nine women) with mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure. Atrial septal puncture per se resulted in a significant increase in ANP and AVP without a significant change in aortic pressure. Subsequent PRMV led to a further increase in ANP, a transient decrease in aortic pressure from 89 +/- 7 to 45 +/- 4 mm Hg, and a large (fivefold) increase in AVP. ANP and AVP were no longer different from baseline values 18 to 24 after the procedure. This study suggests that transseptal puncture and acute mitral obstruction are major stimuli to ANP release and that combined unloading of arterial and left ventricular mechanoreceptors is a very potent vasopressinergic stimulus. 
Cytokine messenger RNA stability is enhanced in tumor cells. Hematopoietic growth factors are produced by a number of human tumors. We extracted RNA from selected human tumor cells known to produce at least one hematopoietic growth factor and found high levels of abnormally stable cytokine messenger (m)RNA. Half-life experiments performed after preventing RNA synthesis by exposing cells to actinomycin D before RNA extraction showed stabilization of cytokine messages in tumor cells in liquid culture as well as in human tumor xenografts grown in mice. Exposure to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) caused enhancement of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) message level in lung cancer cells and in control fibroblasts but elevated levels persisted far longer in the tumor cells. In normal cells, an AU-rich sequence in the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs confers lability to the message. Although a beta-globin gene expression vector containing this region appears to produce unstable mRNA in lung cancer cells, cytokine mRNAs, which also contain this sequence, are very stable in the tumors we studied. This may indicate that another region of the cytokine mRNA molecule is of greater importance than the AU-rich region in determining mRNA stability in tumor cells. 
Expression of embryonic globins by erythroid cells in juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia. Juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia (JCML) is a rare hematopoietic neoplasia of early childhood with distinct hematologic and biochemical features. We studied the biologic properties and the globin synthetic profiles of JCML erythroid cells both in vivo and in vitro from a total of 24 patients. In these cases we observed the exuberant colony-forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) colony growth, as reported previously. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, we found significant erythroid colony growth in most of our cases (average: 1,182 burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFUe] per 10(5) plated cells, range: 40 to 6,927). This growth was by and large erythropoietin-dependent and was not greatly influenced by other added cytokines. By several criteria all erythroid colony growth detected in vitro was derived from JCML progenitors. The globin synthetic profile of JCML erythroid cells showed high levels of fetal hemoglobin both in vivo and in vitro (gamma/gamma + beta: 53% to 94% in reticulocytes, 62% to 98% in BFUe-derived cells). In addition (in seven cases studied) we detected embryonic globins (epsilon and zeta) at the protein and messenger RNA level, a novel finding for primary leukemic cells. We speculate that the transformed erythroid cells in JCML harbor a trans environment supporting expression of developmentally earlier genes (fetal, embryonic). However, in contrast to other acute or subacute leukemias, JCML erythroid cells also have the ability to reach full maturation to the red cell level, thus allowing detection of this primitive program in vivo. 
Midventricular obstruction associated with chronic systemic hypertension and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Midventricular obstruction is an uncommon finding previously defined by catheterization and angiographic techniques in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 10 consecutive patients (mean age 73 years) with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the unusual finding of a dynamic systolic obstruction located in the midportion of the left ventricle. All patients were known to have chronic hypertension, and none had a history or family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In each case, a well-defined, high velocity, turbulent jet was identified by Doppler color flow imaging and subsequently confirmed with conventional Doppler techniques. Septal and posterior wall thickness averaged 1.67 and 1.57 cm, respectively. Mean LV mass index was 199 g/m2 and ejection fraction averaged 78%. Peak systolic velocity obtained by continuous-wave Doppler averaged 2.7 m/s and appeared as either a "late-peaking" or a "spike and dome" configuration. Seven of 10 patients gave a history of syncope or severe presyncope at the time of echocardiographic examination. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, syncope or presyncope had resolved in 5 patients in whom medication was adjusted based on the ultrasound study, but persisted in 2 patients in whom diuretic therapy was continued. It is concluded that obstruction to systolic flow can occur at the mid-LV level in some patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy and avoidance of medication known to lower LV volume may relieve symptoms of transient inadequate cardiac output. 
Prognostic factors in the conservative treatment of ureteric stones. A prospective study was made of 125 ureteric stones in order to detect factors which would predict the successful outcome of conservative treatment. The factors studied were the duration of pain prior to presentation, pyuria, haematuria, surface regularity of the stone and the degree of obstruction as seen radiologically. In stones less than or equal to 10 mm in size, conservative treatment was successful when the duration of pain was less than 30 days (39/45), when there was no significant pyuria (53/82), when the stones had an irregular surface (44/65) and when obstruction was only partial (55/88). Since most of these factors were interactive, further statistical analysis showed that duration of pain was the only significant factor in predicting the outcome of conservative treatment. In stones greater than 10 mm in size these factors had no predictive value and only 2/23 were passed spontaneously on conservative treatment. 
A quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction. Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis. Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch. 
Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia: effects of three different supports. Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is a difficult problem to manage and it may be associated with pain and other complications. Measurements taken from x-rays have been used to obtain objective measures of shoulder subluxation, but have not been used to compare the effects of different shoulder supports. This study used x-ray measurements to evaluate different shoulder supports for subluxation in hemiplegia and to see if there was a significant difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling. The Harris hemisling gave good vertical correction of subluxation and compared closely to the uninvolved shoulder. The Bobath sling did not correct the subluxation as well, and the mean difference between the two slings was significant. The arm trough or lap board was less effective and tended to overcorrect. The Harris hemisling and arm trough or lap board had horizontal measurements similar to the uninvolved shoulders. The Bobath sling, however, distracted the glenohumeral joint horizontally and was more variable. The mean horizontal difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling was significant. These results support the effectiveness and specificity of shoulder support to decrease subluxation after hemiplegia. 
Prevention of portal hypertension and portosystemic shunts by early chronic administration of clonidine in conscious portal vein-stenosed rats. The hemodynamic effects, including mesenteric-systemic shunts of early chronic administration of clonidine, were studied in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein-stenosed rats. In rats receiving early chronic clonidine (600 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 by gavage), begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then administered continuously for 10 consecutive days, portal pressure (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and degree of mesenteric-systemic shunts (58% +/- 25%) were significantly lower than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 83% +/- 7%, respectively). The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. 
Spinal muscular atrophy is not the result of mutations at the beta-hexosaminidase or GM2-activator locus. The disease locus for the clinically heterogeneous childhood spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) maps to the chromosome 5 subregion, 5q11.2-13.3. The beta-subunit of beta-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase (hexosaminidase) (EC 3.2.1.52) (Hex B) maps to the same region, and the protein required for substrate recognition by this enzyme, GM2-activator protein, likewise maps to chromosome 5. We have investigated the possibility of allelic variation among some forms of SMA and hexosaminidase deficiency. Recombination between the Hex B and SMA loci eliminates this enzyme as a candidate site for defects causing the illness. Furthermore, we show that, despite previous evidence to the contrary, the GM2-activator locus does not map to chromosome 5, thereby eliminating it as a candidate gene for SMA. 
Randomized comparative study of hemaccel vs. albumin infusion after total paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Fifty-four cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites were treated with one-session large-volume paracentesis and randomly assigned to two groups. The first group was infused with human albumin, and the second group was infused with hemaccel at doses with comparable oncotic power. The two groups were compared for incidence of complications, recurrence of massive ascites after hospital dismissal and survival rate. The incidence of complications traditionally related to paracentesis, the probability of requiring readmission to the hospital for ascites (p = 0.48) and the probability of survival after entry into the study (p = 0.85) were the same for the two groups. A multivariate analysis of 16 parameters, including treatment modality, identified absolute unresponsiveness to diuretics as the only independent predictor of mortality. These results indicate that hemaccel infusion may safely replace albumin infusion after total paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. 
Preoperative hemostatic activity and excessive bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass. The rationale for predicting the risk of excessive postoperative bleeding by assessing the hemostatic status of a patient before cardiopulmonary bypass was investigated. A novel, rapid, overall test (hemostatometry) consisting of a physiologically relevant test of platelet function (shear-induced hemostasis) and coagulation was performed using nonanticoagulated blood and compared with the routine coagulation screen. Two hundred five patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization were studied 3 to 4 days before operation. Forty-nine bled excessively for nonsurgical reasons; none were predicted by the routine coagulation tests. Using a stepwise discriminant analysis, hemostatometry correctly predicted 31 of 49 (63%). Thirty of 156 predicted as bleeders by hemostatometry did not bleed. Thus, preoperative hemostatometry predicted 77% of the true outcome. The false predictions suggest, however, that certain bleeding abnormalities probably acquired during cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be predicted. These findings do not justify the routine use of preoperative tests in assessing the bleeding risk in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Estimates of radiation absorbed dose for intraperitoneally administered iodine-131 radiolabeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in patients with peritoneal carcinomatoses. Using a newly available model for determining estimates of radiation absorbed dose of radioisotopes administered intraperitoneally, we have calculated absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissues based on a surgically controlled study of radiolabeled antibody distribution. Ten patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis received intraperitoneal injections of the murine monoclonal antibody B72.3 radiolabeled with 131I. Biodistribution studies were performed using nuclear medicine methods until laparotomy at 4-14 days after injection. Surgical biopsies of normal tissues and tumor were obtained. The marrow was predicted to be the critical organ, with maximum tolerated dose [200 rad (2 Gy) to marrow] expected at about 200 mCi (7.4 GBq). In patients with large intraperitoneal tumor deposits, the tumor itself is an important source tissue for radiation exposure to normal tissues. Local "hot-spots" for tumor-absorbed dose were observed, with maximum tumor-absorbed dose calculated at 11,000 rad (11 Gy) per 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) administered intraperitoneal; however, tumor rad dose varied considerably. This may pose serious problems for curative therapy, especially in patients with large tumor burdens. 
Use of hydroxyurea in chronic myeloid leukemia during pregnancy: a case report. The concomitant occurrence of pregnancy and chronic myeloid leukemia is uncommon. The use of hydroxyurea in chronic myeloid leukemia during pregnancy is unknown. We report on a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in whom hydroxyurea was used during pregnancy with a successful outcome for both mother and fetus. 
Evidence for the segregation of a major gene in human susceptibility/resistance to infection by Schistosoma mansoni. Severe clinical disease caused by the major human parasite Schistosoma mansoni is the consequence of high and prolonged infections. Epidemiological studies indicate that, for individuals having frequent contacts with cercaria-infested waters, both infection intensities and reinfection after treatment depend, in large part, on their intrinsic susceptibility/resistance to infection, suggesting the role of genetic factors in human resistance to S. mansoni. To investigate whether a major gene controls human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni, segregation analysis of infection intensities, adjusted for the factors relevant in schistosomiasis (water contact, age, sex), was performed on 20 Brazilian pedigrees (269 individuals), using both the unified mixed model and the regressive model of analysis. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a codominant major gene controlling human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni. Parameter estimates indicate a frequency of .20-.25 for the deleterious allele; thus, about 5% of the population is predisposed to high infections, 60% is resistant, and 35% has an intermediate, although fairly good, level of resistance. These findings provide a genetic basis for earlier observations on the lower resistance and the predisposition to reinfection of certain individuals. In addition to the detection of a major gene effect, the data suggest that immunity to S. mansoni develops progressively during childhood to reach a maximum around the age of puberty. The implications of these results for the strategy to be used in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and to control parasite transmission are discussed. 
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma in a recurrent thoracic chordoma: case report and literature review. Malignant transformation in a recurrent chordoma in the thoracic region is extremely uncommon. One new case, as well as a review of spinal chordomas that have undergone malignant transformation, is reported. Such cases emphasize the importance of the aggressive initial surgical treatment of spinal tumors. 
Effect of NG-monomethyl L-arginine on endothelium-dependent relaxation in arterioles of one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Dose-response curves to topically applied acetylcholine, bradykinin, and nitroprusside were obtained by intravital microscopy in arcading arterioles of the spinotrapezius muscle of control (n = 9) and one-kidney, one clip hypertensive (1K1C) rats (n = 11) of 4 weeks' duration before and during superfusion with the specific inhibitor of nitric oxide formation NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA) (10(-4) M) and both LNMMA (10(-4) M) and indomethacin (2.8 x 10(-5) M). Resting arteriolar tone was higher in 1K1C rats than in controls, and vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin, but not to nitroprusside, was reduced (p less than 0.05) in 1K1C rats compared with controls. LNMMA increased arteriolar tone (p less than 0.05) and inhibited the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin (p less than 0.05) in controls but not in 1K1C rats. LNMMA did not alter the response to nitroprusside in either group. Addition of indomethacin to LNMMA increased arteriolar tone and markedly reduced the response to bradykinin, but not to acetylcholine or nitroprusside, in both groups. These findings suggest that resting arteriolar tone is increased in 1K1C rats partially because of the decreased basal release or synthesis of nitric oxide. Responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and bradykinin were attenuated in 1K1C rats, possibly because of changes in synthesis or release of nitric oxide for acetylcholine and of prostacyclin for bradykinin, because the response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroprusside did not differ between the groups. 
Mutations of the p53 gene in lymphoid leukemia. p53 is currently considered to be a tumor suppressor gene product, and its alterations are suggested to be involved in several human malignancies. Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias. 
Effects of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure on atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin release during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 1. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have increased diuresis during sleep, which decreases with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment. These changes have been attributed to an increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide in obstructive sleep apnoea, and its decrease with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 2. In order to clarify the change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals from nine patients with obstructive sleep apnoea during two nights when the patients were either untreated or treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnographic monitoring, including transcutaneous oximetry, and measurement of oesophageal pressure were performed simultaneously. Plasma arginine vasopressin was also measured. 3. The plasma level of arginine vasopressin did not change. The level of atrial natriuretic peptide was high and exhibited secretion bursts in six out of the nine patients; it drastically decreased with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 4. Across the patients, the mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was correlated with the degree of hypoxaemia and the degree of oesophageal pressure swings during the sleep apnoeas. 5. Within the patients, cross-correlation studies suggested that the atrial natriuretic peptide secretory bursts were related either to the oesophageal pressure swings or to the apnoea-related hypoxaemia. 6. We conclude that release of atrial natriuretic peptide decreases with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in those patients with obstructive sleep apnoea who have increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide before treatment. 
Mastoid surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital 1986-1988. Eighty-three children between ages 0-12 years had mastoid surgery in the three year period 1986-88. The indications were acute mastoiditis (30 children), uncontrolled chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) (24 children), cholesteatoma (22 children) and a miscellaneous group (7 children). Forty-seven per cent of those with acute mastoiditis were under one year but the 27 per cent with cholesteatoma as the precipitating cause were 4-12 years. Twenty-three per cent had significant complications. Typmano-mastoid surgery was employed to resolve uncontrolled CSOM. Children were between 2-12 years and 62 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Seventy-nine per cent of the tympanic membrane grafts were successful. The children with cholesteatoma were between 3-12 years and 76 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Eight of them only presented after the onset of acute mastoiditis. One child had a definite congenital cholesteatoma. Only one had a pars flaccida origin of the cholesteatoma sac and only eight an origin from the postero-superior pars tensa. All had open cavity surgery. When the cavity was lined by temporalis fascia, healing was improved markedly. 
Cytotoxic activity in plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study evaluates an assay of cytotoxic effect of plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Plasma from 20 recently diagnosed ALS patients induced hemolysis of normal red blood cells with a significantly greater intensity than that of normal controls. After at least 1 month of treatment with prednisone and azathioprine, the hemolytic activity of ALS plasma was reduced but was still higher than that of control plasma. 
Longitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. 
Adrenal pheochromocytoma presenting with persistent abdominal and flank pain. Pheochromocytoma is classically associated with paroxysms of headache and hypertension. Its presentation, however, may be more varied and subtle. We present a case of an adolescent female who complained of right upper quadrant and flank pain. A right adrenal pheochromocytoma was diagnosed and subsequently removed. The pertinent literature is discussed. 
Return of interdigestive motor complex after abdominal surgery. End of postoperative ileus? Gastrointestinal mechanical activity was studied in 13 patients after different surgical procedures in a fasted and fed state and after pharmacological stimulation. Mechanical activity was recorded by means of a multi-pressure sensor probe placed intraoperatively into the jejunum. Abdominal surgery abolished normal motility only for a short period of time. The time for the reappearance of regular recurring activity fronts varied with the type of the surgical procedure from 3 hr after cholecystectomy to the sixth postoperative day after colon resection. The fed pattern occurred after the first postoperative interdigestive motor complex in all experiments. Stimulation was observed with ceruletide, which induced contractile activity in the small intestine during postoperative ileus. No coordinated caudad propagating activity was observed. The postoperative interdigestive motor complex did not correlate in time with the first passage of flatus and stool in our patients. Thus, the restoration of motility in the small intestine did not coincide with the clinical relief from the so-called "physiological" postoperative ileus. 
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome in acute traumatic quadriplegia: case reports and literature review. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a condition in which the third portion of the duodenum is intermittently compressed by the overlying superior mesenteric artery, resulting in gastrointestinal obstruction. Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine positioning, and using a spinal orthosis, all of which are common among acute traumatic quadriplegic patients. This paper presents three patients, aged 24, 16, and 20 years, with traumatic quadriplegia treated with supine positioning and cervical orthoses, who had postprandial nausea and emesis, bloating, and abdominal pain during rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic series demonstrated abrupt duodenal obstruction to barium flow in all three patients. Two of the patients had complete relief of symptoms with conservative management, and one required surgical duodenojejunostomy. Enhanced awareness of this condition may result in improved recognition of this disease as a cause of persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal disturbances in quadriplegic persons, thereby optimizing its treatment and reducing its potential morbidity. 
Significance of anti-phospholipid antibodies in patients with lupus nephritis. Anti-phospholipid antibodies (APA) as markers or mediators of thrombosis in lupus could be of pathogenetic significance in nephritis, since glomerular capillary thrombi are an indicator of subsequent renal dysfunction. Isotype specific APA antibodies were measured, using cardiolipin as the antigen, in 76 patients with lupus nephritis. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had elevated IgG APA. Overall, 43% of patients showed raised levels of at least one isotype. In general, APA had specificity for anionic phospholipids. In vitro lupus anticoagulant activity was associated with all three isotypes of APA, but only the IgM isotype correlated with the biological false positive test for syphilis. APA were not associated with thromboses or neurological involvement, and only the IgA isotype correlated with thrombocytopenia. We confirmed an association between the presence of intraglomerular thrombi and serum IgG APA. However, we found no association between APA and renal histological pattern, or long-term renal function. Our data, therefore, do not support a major pathogenetic role for APA in the nephritis of lupus in treated patients. 
Submaximal exercise thallium-201 SPECT for assessment of interventional therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing has been shown to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic value of early submaximal stress testing and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after interventional therapy. Scintigraphic results from 56 patients with infarctions, who underwent acute thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or both, were compared with late (6 weeks) functional outcome as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography and with results of discharge coronary angiography. A linear correlation was found between the extent of thallium-201 SPECT perfusion defect and late ventricular function (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01). Forty-two percent of patients with large SPECT perfusion defects had normal left ventricular ejection fractions, suggesting an overestimation of infarct size by early imaging. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of coronary artery stenosis in noninfarct territories was 57% and 46%, respectively, indicating limited diagnostic definition of extent of underlying coronary artery disease. Results of follow-up coronary angiography showed a significant relationship between the size of the initial perfusion defect and early restenosis or reocclusion of the infarct artery. Thus the extent of early thallium-201 perfusion defects correlates with late functional outcome but appears to overestimate the degree of injury. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing allows only limited characterization of underlying coronary artery disease. Early assessment of infarct size may identify a patient population at high risk for reocclusion of the infarct artery. 
Intelligence at six years in relation to neonatal bilirubin levels: follow-up of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Clinical Trial of Phototherapy. Results of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Randomized Controlled Trial of Phototherapy were examined for the relationship of neonatal bilirubin level to neurological and developmental outcome at 6-year follow-up. This analysis focused on 224 control children with birth weight of less than 2000 g. Bilirubin levels were maintained below previously specified levels by the use of exchange transfusion only (24%). Rates of cerebral palsy were not significantly higher for children with elevated maximum bilirubin level than for those whose level remained low. No association was evident between maximum bilirubin level and IQ (Full Scale, Verbal, or Performance) by simple correlation analysis (r = -.087, P = .2 for Full Scale) or by multiple linear regression adjusting for factors that covary with IQ (beta = -.15, P = .58). IQ was not associated with mean bilirubin level, time and duration of exposure to bilirubin, or measures of bilirubin-albumin binding. Thus, over the range of bilirubin levels permitted in this clinical trial, there was no evidence of bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system. Measures used to control the level of bilirubin in low birth weight neonates appear to prevent effectively the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. 
Inverted colonic diverticulum: air contrast barium enema findings in six cases. A polypoid elevation of the colonic wall was identified on air contrast barium enema in six patients. The abnormality in each case was found to be an inverted colonic diverticulum. Inverted diverticula appeared as broad-based, smooth, sessile polyps measuring 1.5-2.0 cm. In five of the six patients a characteristic central umbilication and/or evidence of barium within the polyp could be identified. The diagnosis was confirmed in three patients by demonstrating an everted diverticulum replacing the suspected lesion. In the remaining three patients, two of whom had normal findings on colonoscopy, the diagnosis was strongly suggested by the presence of barium extending into the substance of the mass. Additional radiologic maneuvers or a second study may permit accurate diagnosis if the possibility of inverted diverticulum is considered. However, even when the diverticulum cannot be demonstrated, a central umbilication or barium within a smooth intraluminal projection should suggest inverted diverticulum and prevent unnecessary endoscopy or inadvertent diverticulectomy. 
Persistent polyclonal B lymphocytosis with Epstein-Barr virus antibodies and subsequent malignant pulmonary blastoma. Persistent polyclonal B lymphocytosis (PPBL), a rare benign lymphoproliferative disorder, occurred in a 25 year old woman. The lymphocytes showed the phenotype cIgM+, FMC7+, CD19+, CD20+, which was similar to that seen in Waldenstrom's macroglobinaemia, but the proliferation was repeatedly shown to be polyclonal both immunologically and by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies. Eleven years after presentation the patient developed a malignant pulmonary blastoma, a rare pulmonary tumour of combined epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The failure to develop a lymphoid malignancy over 11 years together with immunological and genetic evidence of polyclonality confirms that PPBL is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. The subsequent occurrence of a nonhaemopoietic malignancy suggests that benign lymphoid proliferations, like their malignant counterparts, may predispose to the development of neoplasia. A role for Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of one or both of these rare conditions is suggested by the finding of raised Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen titres. 
Family history in patients with transient ischemic attacks. To determine the influence of family history on vascular disease, we surveyed hospital patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack. Of 117 respondents, 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for stroke. Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction, and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of stroke. As expected, there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger (aged less than 70 years) patients (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.014). This association was reversed for stroke (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.017). Older (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of stroke; 14 (74%) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of stroke had a positive family history of stroke. The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of stroke compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes, differing stroke subtypes in older age groups, or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction. This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease. Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain. 
Concomitant benefit of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreas fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Preoperative irradiation improves both the resectability and curability of carcinoma of the pancreas head area and should improve patient survival. We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation. 
Hypertension, cardiac disease, and compliance in minority patients. In minorities, as in the general population, hypertension is taken seriously because it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Until recently, our understanding of the role that hypertension plays in the heart disease seen in minorities has been limited by a paucity of prospective data regarding the prevalence, natural history, and pathophysiology of the disease process in minority populations. In the last few years large-scale epidemiologic studies and well-controlled clinical studies alike have confirmed usually high rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics. The severity of end-organ damage, both cardiac and renal, that is seen in these patients--especially when coupled with the severe cerebrovascular damage that is also more common in black and Hispanic hypertensives--mandate that more effective public health measures be taken to reduce the incidence of hypertension in these patient populations. Because hypertension is usually without significant clinical symptoms, noncompliance with drug therapy and high dropout rates are common in all patient populations. They are strikingly higher in inner-city populations, however, where illiteracy, poverty, homelessness, and high rates of chemical dependency combine to exacerbate an already serious problem in treating hypertensive patients. Inner-city patients are, increasingly, black and Hispanic patients, and these patients are more likely to be underinsured or uninsured, to be functionally illiterate in English, to be disinclined to seek health care, and to be less capable of following a prescribed regimen than the populace as a whole. The nature of the therapeutic regimen itself is probably the most important determinant of compliance, and compliance with drug therapy will be improved if the clinic chooses a simplified drug regimen and avoids drugs that produce intolerable side effects. Once-a-day--or, with transdermal clonidine, one-a-week--single-drug therapy may not be possible in all patients, but multiple drug therapy and multiple daily dosing schedules should be avoided wherever possible. 
Fetal death associated with measles virus infection of the placenta. A case of fetal death at 25 weeks' gestation, which was associated with maternal measles infection, is described. Immunohistochemical study revealed measles virus antigen in the syncytial trophoblastic cells and decidua but not in the fetus. Results suggest that fetal death was caused by measles virus infection in the placenta. As far as we know, this is the first report in which a measles virus antigen was detected in the placenta by the immunohistochemical method. 
Effect of mitral regurgitation on pulmonary venous velocities derived from transesophageal echocardiography color-guided pulsed Doppler imaging. The effect of mitral regurgitation on pulmonary venous flow velocity was studied in 66 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. Nine patients were studied intraoperatively before and after surgery, so that 75 pulmonary venous flow tracings were analyzed. Fifty-four patients had no significant (0 to 1+) mitral regurgitation and 21 had significant (2 to 3+) mitral regurgitation. Comparison of both groups revealed significant differences in the pulmonary venous flow pattern. In patients with no significant mitral regurgitation, the peak systolic velocity was higher (55 +/- 16 vs. -4 +/- 16 cm/s; p less than 0.0001) and the peak diastolic velocity was lower (43 +/- 13 vs. 59 +/- 17 cm/s; p less than 0.01) when compared with values in patients with significant mitral regurgitation. Consequently, the peak systolic/diastolic velocity ratio was significantly higher in the patients without significant mitral regurgitation (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.4 +/- 1.3; p less than 0.0001). The same trend was noted with respect to the systolic and diastolic velocity integrals. As the degree of mitral regurgitation increased, the peak diastolic velocity and diastolic velocity integral increased, whereas the peak systolic velocity and systolic velocity integral decreased. In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the systolic flow became reversed (retrograde). The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow for severe mitral regurgitation was 90% (9 of 10), the specificity was 100% (65 of 65), the positive predictive value was 100% (9 of 9), the negative predictive value was 98% (65 of 66) and the predictive accuracy was 99% (74 of 75). 
Role of extended aortoplasty related to the definition of coarctation of the aorta. One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta. Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg. Numerous methods of repair were used. The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late. Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%). We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure. A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation. Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects. We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as "the procedure of choice," providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation. 
Improvement of outcome for infants of birth weight under 1000 g. The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The two year outcome of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight 500 to 999 g), born in the state of Victoria over two distinct eras, 1979-80 and 1985-7, were compared. In the 1979-80 era, 25.4% of the ELBW infants survived to 2 years of age; only 12.5% of liveborn ELBW infants survived to 2 years with no neurological disabilities. In the 1979-80 era, ELBW infants born outside the level III centres in the state were significantly disadvantaged in both mortality and neurological morbidity. By 1985-7, the two year survival rate of ELBW infants rose significantly from 25.4% to 37.9%. By 1985-7, the proportion of ELBW infants who survived to 2 years free of neurological disabilities increased from 12.5% to 26.2%. Despite the improved survival, the absolute number of 2 year old children survivors with severe neurological disabilities remained constant at 8/year in both eras. By 1985-7, fewer ELBW infants were born outside the level III centres, their survival rate remained lower, but the severe neurological disability rate in survivors was no longer significantly higher. There has been a concomitant improvement in both survival and reduction in neurological morbidity. 
Comparison of accuracy of transesophageal versus transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of mitral valve prolapse with ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet). The accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography was compared with that of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet) in 27 patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who underwent valve repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation. Confirmation of the presence of ruptured chordae resulting in a flail leaflet was available at surgery in all cases. The echocardiographic studies were read blindly by 2 independent observers with any differences resolved by a third. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 63 +/- 13 years. Men (n = 20) outnumbered women (n = 7) (p less than 0.02), and tended to be younger (p = 0.06). Flail leaflets were identified in 20 of 27 patients. In 1 patient, both leaflets were involved and in the remaining 19 patients posterior leaflets (15 patients) were more frequently affected than anterior leaflets (4 patients). Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified all 20 patients with flail leaflets, but 1 false positive study occurred among the 7 patients without a flail leaflet. In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography identified only 12 of 20 patients with flail leaflets, with no false positive studies. Transesophageal echocardiography was more accurate, correctly classifying 26 of 27 (96%) cases versus 19 of 27 (70%) by the transthoracic approach (p less than 0.01). This study suggests a higher incidence of chordal rupture to the posterior leaflet in patients with MVP and demonstrates improved accuracy of transesophageal over transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of flail leaflets. 
Effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal repair in rats with experimental chronic diarrhea. Nucleic acid synthesis in tissues of rapid growth is preferentially done using dietary purines and pyrimidines via the salvage pathway. In the case of a low protein intake, dietary nucleotides may be semiessential for cell replication of gut, lymphocytes, and bone marrow, and especially in those intestinal diseases in which the mucosa is altered, dietary nucleotides may have a role in intestinal development. The effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal weight and length, gut mucosal weight, intestinal protein and DNA contents, and lactase, maltase, and intestinal mucosal activities was assessed in a controlled way. Weanling (21-day-old) rats were separated into two groups of 36, each receiving blindly a basal diet containing glucose polymers (C) or a basal diet with lactose as the main carbohydrate (L) for 15 days. Those fed with L developed a syndrome of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. Ten rats of each group were sacrificed at that time. The rest of the animals of each group were separated into two subgroups. The first was fed with the C diet and the second with the C diet supplemented with 50 mg/100 g of each of the following nucleotides: AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and IMP (CN). Thus the subgroups CC, CN, LC, and LN were formed. Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks and gut separated into three segments corresponding to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of diet or segments. DNA and lactase, maltase, and sucrase activities increased in the LN group with respect to LC especially in jejunum and ileum but there were not any differences between CC and CN. 
The interpretation of dysprosody in patients with Parkinson's disease. Prosodic features in the speech production of 21 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were tested. The appreciation of vocal and facial expression was also examined in the same patients. Significant intergroup differences were found in the prosody production tasks but, in contrast to previous results, not in the receptive tasks on the recognition and appreciation of prosody and of facial expression. The discrepancy between the production and recognition of prosodic features does not support the suggestion that dysprosody in Parkinson's disease is necessarily a disorder of processing emotional information that could be misinterpreted as a dysarthria. 
Quality of life in long-term survivors of CNS tumors of childhood and adolescence. Clinical reports of small numbers of pediatric brain tumor patients observed for brief periods suggest that long-term survivors continue to have major handicaps into adulthood. To quantify these late effects we interviewed 342 adults (or their proxies) who had CNS tumors diagnosed before the age of 20 between 1945 and 1974, survived at least 5 years, and reached 21 years of age. Survivors were 32 years old on average at follow-up. When compared with 479 matched siblings as controls. CNS tumor survivors were more likely to have died or to have become mentally incompetent sometime during the follow-up period. They were more likely to be at risk for such adverse outcomes as unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 25.7], to have a health condition that affected their ability to work (OR, 5.9; CI, 3.7 to 9.4), to be unable to drive (OR, 28.8; CI, 6.9 to 119.9), or to describe their current health as poor (OR, 7.8; CI, 1.7 to 35.7). Unfavorable outcomes were more frequent in male survivors than in females, in those with supratentorial tumors compared with infratentorial ones, and in those who received radiation therapy. As clinicians consider improving therapies, they should anticipate late effects, such as those we observed, and attempt to target subgroups for interventions that may improve subsequent quality of life. 
Verapamil and migraine prophylaxis: mechanisms and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers have demonstrated efficacy in investigative use for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches. In particular, verapamil, with its low side-effect profile, appears to be a promising alternative to the currently available agents for prophylactic treatment of chronic recurring headaches. Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis. A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache. 
Relation of cellular drug resistance to long-term clinical outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The clinical relevance of cellular drug resistance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is unknown. The relation between in-vitro sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs at initial diagnosis and long-term clinical outcome was investigated in 44 children with ALL. The short-term MTT assay was used to assess sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, colaspase (asparaginase), daunorubicin, and thioguanine (instead of mercaptopurine which is unstable in vitro). For vincristine and colaspase there was no difference in outcome (probability of continuous complete remission) between sensitive and resistant patients. However, the probability of continuous complete remission was significantly lower in patients with resistant cells than in those with sensitive cells for thioguanine (p less than 0.01), daunorubicin (p less than 0.02), and prednisolone (p less than 0.05). For prednisolone there was a significant worsening of the prognosis (p less than 0.05) from the extremely sensitive patients through an intermediate group to the most resistant group. The prognostic significance of cellular drug resistance was independent of white-blood-cell count, age, sex, and hepatosplenomegaly. Leukaemic cells from boys were more resistant to thioguanine than those from girls. Thus, the short-term highly efficient MTT assay can help to predict long-term response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL. 
Rationale for a primary prevention study using low-dose aspirin to prevent coronary and cerebrovascular disease in the elderly. The benefits of prophylactic aspirin therapy to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. The rationale for developing a multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) prevents cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in persons aged 70 years and over with no evidence of pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease is described. Sample size calculations have indicated that 15,000 subjects would be required over a 4-year follow-up period in order to demonstrate a 20% reduction in overall cardiovascular mortality at the 0.01 level with a power of 0.8. Such a large-scale community-based clinical trial has never been conducted in Australia in this age group. Therefore the PACE (prevention by low-dose aspirin of cardiovascular disease in the elderly) pilot study has been developed to test recruitment strategies and methods and ascertaining disease end-points. 
Myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and autologous bone marrow infusions for treatment of neuroblastoma: factors influencing engraftment. Bone marrow harvested from cancer patients for autologous bone marrow reinfusion (ABMR) after myeloablative treatment may be injured, in both its proliferating and stromal cell pools, by either previous treatment or manipulation at the time of harvest. We have examined the relative effects of seven covariates on hematologic recovery after ABMR in children with neuroblastoma (NBL) using univariate and step-up analysis. We measured recovery by times to achieve (1) white blood cell counts greater than 1,000/microL; (2) absolute neutrophil counts greater than 500/microL; and (3) platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL without transfusion. In univariate analysis, recovery was significantly associated with the amount of prior chemotherapy and the interval between last chemotherapy and marrow harvest. Patient sex, the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused, harvest-to-freeze interval, and use of purging were marginally associated. After adjusting for potential confounders in a multivariate model, the amounts of chemotherapy and granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused were independently significant predictors of time to total white blood cell count recovery; chemotherapy courses and chemo-to-harvest interval were predictors of neutrophil count recovery; and sex, use of purging, and harvest-to-freeze interval were marginal predictors of platelet recovery. The speed of hematologic recovery after ABMR seems to depend mainly on pre-existing factors and marginally on manipulation of the marrow after harvest. These factors may affect both proliferating and stromal cell pools. 
Golf for the mature athlete. Golf is a different sport from all others discussed in this issue in one important aspect: Almost all of its practitioners play more, rather than less, as they mature. A great many of them play better, too. This additional play and skill can be highly satisfying to the participants; however, it puts them at risk for a number of overuse syndromes directly caused by the motion requirements of golf. In addition, the repetitive nature of the activity can exacerbate pre-existing and age-related orthopedic pathology as well. There is no substitute for attention to the preplay aspects of golf (warm-up, flexibility, and strengthening). 
Treatment of acute cluster headache with sumatriptan. The Sumatriptan Cluster Headache Study Group BACKGROUND. Attacks of cluster headache are difficult to treat. Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine1-like receptors, has proved effective in the treatment of migraine. The clinical similarities between migraine and cluster headache and positive results from an open pilot study in patients with cluster headache indicated that sumatriptan should be evaluated more rigorously in the treatment of this condition. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in 49 patients with cluster headache. The patients received, in random order, a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan for one cluster-headache attack and placebo for another attack. The results for the two attacks could be fully evaluated for 39 patients. A response to treatment was defined as complete or almost complete relief of headache (no pain or mild pain) within 15 minutes after the injection. RESULTS. In the 39 patients, the severity of headache decreased in 74 percent of the attacks within 15 minutes of treatment with sumatriptan, as compared with 26 percent of the attacks for which placebo was given (P less than 0.001). Thirty-six percent of the patients were free of pain within 10 minutes after the administration of sumatriptan, as compared with 3 percent after placebo (P less than 0.001); by 15 minutes these numbers had increased to 46 percent and 10 percent, respectively (P less than 0.001). Thirteen percent of the patients required oxygen as an additional treatment 15 minutes after receiving sumatriptan, as compared with 49 percent of those who received placebo. The severity of functional disability and the incidence of ipsilateral conjunctival injection also decreased more in response to sumatriptan than placebo. Sumatriptan was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS. Sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute attacks of cluster headache. 
An overview of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. This symposium reviewed the risk factors and problems associated with venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, especially those patients having total hip replacement. The importance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was emphasized by a theoretical analysis indicating that venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement not only saves lives but is also effective. A discussion of the pharmacology of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) included a review of its role, clinically and experimentally, in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Three of the discussants presented their favorable experiences with LMWH in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement. It can be concluded that LMWH does reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement without causing an increase in blood loss. If its effectiveness and safety remain substantiated, LMWH may soon become the preferred agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 
Sexual headaches: case report, review, and treatment with calcium blocker. A case is reported in which a patient with sexual and orgasmic headaches was treated successfully with a calcium channel blocker, diltiazem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful treatment of sexual headaches with calcium channel blockers reported in the English medical literature. The literature on sexually related headaches is reviewed, and classification, evaluation, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of sexual headaches are discussed. 
Natural history of isolated atrial flutter in infancy. To clarify the natural history of isolated (i.e., without associated congenital cardiac anomalies) atrial flutter in infancy, we reviewed the clinical course in nine patients who were seen with this arrhythmia in the first year of life (range 1 day to 4 months). Atrial flutter was identified by the typical sawtooth pattern in leads II, III, and aVF of the surface electrocardiogram or the pattern of atrial flutter on an atrial electrogram recorded through the esophagus. The mean cycle length of the atrial flutter was 151 msec (atrial rate 397 beats/min). Six of the nine patients had other perinatal problems, such as immune and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (two patients), pneumonia (one patient), anemia (five patients), or low birth weight (one patient). In all patients the rhythm reverted to normal, either spontaneously (two patients), with overdrive pacing (four patients), or after oral digoxin therapy (three patients). No consistent temporal relationship between digoxin administration and conversion was observed; conversion was instantaneous in the four patients who received atrial overdrive pacing. Four patients were discharged receiving digoxin therapy (6 months to 1 year). One patient had supraventricular tachycardia after discharge that was controlled with digoxin. No recurrence of atrial flutter was observed among the nine patients during a mean follow-up of 6.8 years (range 0.2 to 20 years). We conclude that isolated atrial flutter in infancy is rare, has a good prognosis, may be related to transient perinatal events, and often spontaneously converts to normal sinus rhythm; however, when it does not, it will respond to transesophageal pacing. Acute and chronic digoxin therapy is probably unnecessary. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
Introduction: physiologic adaptations to exercise training in cardiac patients: contemporary issues and concerns. This symposium dealt with contemporary issues and concerns in cardiac rehabilitation. Selected topics included: the potential of exercise training to enhance coronary collateral circulation; safety and efficacy of high intensity training; influence of beta-blocking agents on exercise prescription and trainability; value of physical conditioning in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac transplantation; and the effect of exercise on serum lipids and lipoproteins. Each article attempted to assimilate the physiologically germane literature in an area and provide the reader with associated clinical and practical implications. 
Malignant schwannoma associated with xeroderma pigmentosum in a patient belonging to complementation group D. A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D. He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities. Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype. They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve. This may be the first case of a peripheral nervous tissue neoplasm in xeroderma pigmentosum. 
Symptomatic Chiari malformation in adults: a new classification based on magnetic resonance imaging with clinical and prognostic significance. Thirty-five consecutive adults with Chiari malformation and progressive symptoms underwent surgical treatment at a single institution over a 3-year period. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan before and after surgery. Images of the craniovertebral junction confirmed tonsillar herniation in all cases and allowed the definition of two anatomically distinct categories of the Chiari malformation in this age group. Twenty of the 35 patients had concomitant syringomyelia and were classified as Type A. The remaining 15 patients had evidence of frank herniation of the brain stem below the foramen magnum without evidence of syringomyelia and were labeled Type B. Type A patients had a predominant central cord symptomatology; Type B patients exhibited signs and symptoms of brain stem or cerebellar compression. The principal surgical procedure consisted of decompression of the foramen magnum, opening of the fourth ventricular outlet, and plugging of the obex. Significant improvement in preoperative symptoms and signs was observed in 9 of the 20 patients (45%) with syringomyelia (Type A), as compared to 13 of the 15 patients (87%) without syringomyelia (Type B). Postoperative reduction in syrinx volume was observed in 11 of the 20 patients with syringomyelia, including all 9 patients with excellent results. Magnetic resonance imaging has allowed a classification of the adult Chiari malformation in adults based on objective anatomic criteria, with clinical and prognostic relevance. The presence of syringomyelia implies a less favorable response to surgical intervention. 
Combination thrombolytic therapy: a comparison of simultaneous and sequential regimens of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy for acute myocardial infarction has been associated with a high incidence of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, and a relatively high in-hospital mortality. In contrast, the combination of t-PA and urokinase, when given intravenously prior to coronary angiography, appears to be associated with a low incidence of post-rescue angioplasty reocclusion. In order to determine whether intraprocedural urokinase, given at the time of rescue coronary angioplasty for failed t-PA therapy, improves long-term patency of the infarct vessel to the same extent as preangiographic, combination t-PA/urokinase therapy, three thrombolytic treatment strategies were retrospectively compared. The first group included 86 patients undergoing rescue angioplasty after t-PA monotherapy (t-PA alone). The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients who received intravenous or intracoronary urokinase during rescue angioplasty following unsuccessful t-PA therapy (sequential t-PA/urokinase therapy), and with those of 34 patients undergoing rescue coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful therapy with the combination of intravenous t-PA and urokinase (simultaneous therapy). There was no difference in postangioplasty patency rate of the infarct-related artery between the three groups. However, the sequential t-PA/urokinase regimen was associated with a subsequent reocclusion rate that was lower than the rate that occurred in the t-PA monotherapy group but higher than the rate in the simultaneous t-PA/urokinase group (13 versus 29 versus 2%, respectively; p = 0.003). 
Atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli in stroke patients. In 539 consecutive stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation department, we studied the possible role of atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by analyzing a series of relevant clinical data in patients with and without atrial fibrillation and in patients with and without venous thromboembolic complications. Deep venous thrombosis as well as advanced age and cardiac disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, in a model of simultaneous logistic regression carried out on the presence of absence of venous thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation was the only significant risk factor. In view of the morbidity and mortality linked to deep venous thrombosis, our findings argue for preventive anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and merit further study. 
Large mediastinal mass secondary to an aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft aneurysm. A case of a 62-year-old man with a large mediastinal mass who had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting 17 years earlier is presented. Computed tomography showed a 13-cm extrinsic cystic mass believed to represent a pericardial cyst or teratoma. Intraoperatively, the patient was noted to have an aneurysm of his right coronary artery bypass graft. We were able to find 4 other cases seen in this manner. 
Replacement of cholesterol gallstones by murideoxycholyl taurine gallstones in prairie dogs fed murideoxycholic acid. The effect of two hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid (3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid, on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic pathology and gallstone composition was studied in the prairie dog. Cholesterol gallstones were induced by feeding a diet containing 1.2% cholesterol for 75 days. The animals were divided into six groups, and gallstone regression was studied as follows: groups 2 and 5, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol; groups 3 and 6, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% ursodeoxycholic acid; groups 4 and 7, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% murideoxycholic acid. Animals in groups 2 to 4 were killed after an additional 6 wk; animals in groups 5 to 7 were killed after an additional 12 wk. Gallstone dissolution did not occur in any group. The gallstones in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were typical cholesterol aggregates, as determined by polarized light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The gallstones of the murideoxycholic acid group were large, solitary, dark stones that appeared radiopaque under 22 kVp x-ray examination. Scanning electron microscopy showed that in these stones the cholesterol crystals had been replaced by an amorphous material, both within the stone and on the stone surface. Chemical analysis indicated that at the end of 12 wk the calcium/sodium salt of the taurine conjugate of murideoxycholic acid (murideoxycholyl taurine) comprised 70% of the stones; protein, cholesterol and small amounts of other bile salts were also present. In vitro studies confirmed the insolubility of the sodium and calcium salts of murideoxycholyl taurine. These studies indicate that the hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, did not achieve gallstone dissolution under the conditions used. In the animals fed murideoxycholic acid, an insoluble calcium salt of murideoxycholyl taurine replaced cholesterol as the major constituent of gallbladder stones. This is the first example of an insoluble dihydroxy taurine-conjugated bile acid; administration of the unconjugated bile acid induced precipitation of a kind of gallstone not previously reported. The final result was transformation of cholesterol stones to bile salt stones. 
Functional evaluation following microvascular oromandibular reconstruction of the oral cancer patient: a comparative study of reconstructed and nonreconstructed patients. Over the past decade, the use of free flap transfers in head and neck surgery has led to remarkable advances in the reliability and the ultimate results of oromandibular reconstruction. Stable and retentive dental restorations have been achieved using enosseous implants placed directly into the vascularized bone flaps. However, the functional assessment of patients who underwent primary mandibular reconstruction with these techniques has not been previously reported. A group of 10 reconstructed and 10 nonreconstructed segmental hemimandibulectomy patients were compared using a battery of tests to assess their overall well-being, cosmesis, deglutition, oral competence, speech, length of hospitalization, and dental rehabilitation. In addition, objective measures of the masticatory apparatus (interincisal opening, bite force, chewing performance, and chewing stroke) were used to compare these two groups as well as normal healthy subjects and edentulous patients restored with conventional and implant-borne dentures. The results show a clear advantage for the reconstructed patients in almost all categories. Persistent problems and future directions in oromandibular reconstruction are discussed. 
In vitro study of the interaction of doxorubicin, thiotepa, and mitomycin-C, agents used for intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer. Several cytotoxic agents have been identified as effective in the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, including doxorubicin, thiotepa and mitomycin-C. An in vitro study was conducted to assess the interactions of these three drugs against a well differentiated human bladder tumor cell line, RT-4, to identify and evaluate synergistic combinations among these agents. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a colorimetric assay based on the capacity of viable cells to metabolize a tetrazolium dye, MTT, to produce a colored formazan product. The analyses of drug interactions were done by the isobolographic method (construction of isoeffect plots). The combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa was found to be the most synergistic, followed by the combination of doxorubicin and mitomycin-C. The combination of mitomycin C and thiotepa demonstrated an unpredictable effect. These findings suggest the combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa has potential advantage for chemotherapy of superficial bladder tumors. 
Is fetal cellular rhabdomyoma an entity or a differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma? A study of patients with rhabdomyoma of the tongue and sarcoma of the tongue enrolled in the intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma studies I, II, and III. A tumor of the tongue with features consistent with the diagnosis of fetal cellular rhabdomyoma was seen in an 18-month-old infant. The tumor recurred 10 and 22 months after initial resection. The histologic condition of the first recurrence was similar to the original tumor except for some increased nuclear irregularities and mitotic activity. No adjunctive therapy was administered initially or after the first recurrence. The second recurrence showed mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This case represented a unique model of a highly differentiated striated muscle tumor converting to a moderately differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, and illustrated differential diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing between fetal cellular rhabdomyoma and differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient was compared with eight children and adolescents with primary sarcomas of the tongue who entered the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) I, II, and III protocols. The tumors of all eight arose at the base of the tongue. There were five embryonal, one alveolar, and one mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and one undifferentiated myxoid sarcoma. Five rhabdomyosarcomas were poorly differentiated, and two had a moderate degree of myogenesis. These sarcomas of the tongue represent approximately 0.34% of all cases entered in IRS studies. 
Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty for osteosarcoma and other aggressive bone tumors. Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty is a reconstruction alternative after limb salvage for aggressive bone tumors. It combines an off-the-shelf implant with a fresh-frozen allograft and has several potential advantages over conventional techniques. Good clinical results can be achieved with acceptable morbidity. The procedure can be performed successfully even in patients receiving chemotherapy. Nonunion was the most common complication encountered but was amenable to autogenous iliac bone graft. The procedure can be customized to meet the needs of the patient, making custom implant manufacturing delay and expense unnecessary. 
Group C streptococcal bacteremia: analysis of 88 cases. Eighty-eight cases of group C streptococcal bacteremia were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had underlying diseases (72.7%), predominantly cardiovascular disease (20.5%) or malignancy (20.5%). The infection originated most often from the upper respiratory tract (20.5%), the gastrointestinal tract (18.2%), or the skin (17.1%). Prior exposure to animals or animal products was reported in 23.9% of cases. The most common clinical manifestations of group C streptococcal bacteremia were endocarditis (27.3%), primary bacteremia (22.7%), and meningitis (10.2%). Of streptococcal isolates, 61.4% were not speciated, 19.3% were Streptococcus equisimilis, 17.1% were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and two (2.3%) were Streptococcus equi. The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics, and most patients were treated with beta-lactam agents. Mortality was high (25.0%), especially among older patients and patients with endocarditis, meningitis, and disseminated infection. Group C streptococcal bacteremia does not differ from bloodstream infection caused by other beta-hemolytic streptococci with regard to clinical presentation, treatment, or outcome. 
Thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery: a multicenter review of 602 cases. A multicenter review of 602 procedures was performed to evaluate the effects of thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty on the superficial femoral artery. Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. 
Acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors induced by interleukin-1 alpha: effects independent of tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein synthesized in response to the endotoxin bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is the classical mediator of acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. We have demonstrated that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), with a spectrum of activities very similar to those of TNF, also causes acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. Both TNF and IL-1 induce a cascade of events including the synthesis or release of each other. The present studies were thus undertaken to determine whether the hemorrhagic necrosis induced in tumors by IL-1 alpha is due to TNF. Kinetic parameters of IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage were similar to those observed with recombinant murine TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) or LPS in RIF-1 fibrosarcomas in C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) mice. However, the amount of TNF found in the sera or tumors of animals treated with LPS was more than 20-fold higher than in mice treated with IL-1 alpha, and LPS induced similar degrees of hemorrhagic necrosis, which was measured by determining the packed volume of red blood cells by 59Fe labeling. A low but significantly hemorrhagic dose of IL-1 alpha induced no detectable TNF in tumors. Pretreatment with 250 micrograms of neutralizing antibody to TNF had no effect on IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage, whereas TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced hemorrhagic effects were significantly reduced. These results demonstrate an important antitumor activity of IL-1 alpha that appears to be independent of TNF. 
Estrogen and progesterone binding by acoustic neuroma tissue. Tissue samples from 37 acoustic neuromas were assayed for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor binding by radioimmunoassay using a dextran-coated charcoal method and Scatchard plot analysis. Twenty-one of the samples were from men, and 16 of the samples were from women. Seven of 37 samples (19%) were positive for estrogen receptor and six of 36 samples (17%) were positive for progesterone receptor. Three of 37 samples (8%) were positive for both receptors. There was no correlation of estrogen receptor positivity with the sex of the patient. These results indicate that estrogen or progesterone receptor binding activity or both are present in a small subset of acoustic tumors. Evidence is lacking, however, that binding of estrogen to the receptor results in growth changes in the tumor. The empirical use of antiestrogen treatment in acoustic neuroma does not appear to be justified at the present time. 
Nontraumatic surgical emergencies in children. Clinical conditions that require operative intervention are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Common causes such as pyloric stenosis, intussusception, inguinal hernias, torsion of the testicle, and ingested foreign bodies are discussed, and aids in diagnosis and early intervention are addressed. Conditions that mimic surgical problems also are mentioned. 
Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Changes in the characteristics of myocardial infarction patients: 1980 vs 1988. This study examined myocardial infarction cases in an urban community hospital in the years 1980 and 1988. There were 56 well-documented heart attacks in 1980, and 80 in 1988. The sex ratio changed from 43/13 (male/female) in 1980 to 34/46 in 1988 (p = .0001). The percentage of diabetics increased from 27% in 1980 to 44% in 1988 (p = .044). The diabetics were older on average than the nondiabetics (69.7 years vs 65.1 years, p = .017). During the two years, 30 patients died in the hospital. Those who died were, on average, older than the survivors (71.4 years vs 65.4 years, p = .012) and were more likely to be white than black. More women than men died in 1988 (12 out of 13, p = .014), but the overall effect of sex on survival for both years was not significant. These results demonstrate a substantial change in the demographics of myocardial infarctions in the last decade. 
Prognostic significance of the proportion of Ki-67-positive cells in adult T-cell leukemia. The authors examined peripheral blood samples from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 which detects a nuclear antigen present in actively proliferating cells. In patients with chronic ATL, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly lower than in acute ATL patients (median values, 3.3% versus 18.9%, P less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant inverse correlation between the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and the length of survival (P less than 0.001). Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels also showed a significant inverse correlation with survival, but this was less strong than that for Ki-67 (0.01 less than P less than 0.02). Thus, Ki-67 positivity appears to indicate the aggressiveness of ATL, and can possibly be used for the clinical classification of ATL patients as well as for the prediction of prognosis. 
Serum levels of Hyskon during hysteroscopic procedures. Hyskon hysteroscopy fluid is used with the hysteroscope as an aid in distending the uterine cavity and in visualizing its surfaces. We correlated the amount of Hyskon used during hysteroscopy with both the instillation pressures generated within the uterine cavity and with serum levels of Hyskon in 11 healthy subjects. Serum levels in excess of 1000 mg% were measured at 30 min when an amount of Hyskon greater than 300 mL was used. Intrauterine Hyskon absorption and/or injection during hysteroscopy were found even after volumes of Hyskon as small as 50-100 mL were used. Serum levels were significantly higher with the larger amounts of Hyskon used in ablative procedures (P less than 0.01), as compared with serum levels seen with the smaller amounts of Hyskon used for diagnostic procedures. The injection pressures should be low to minimize the amount of intravascular injection. In cases in which extensive ablative procedures are necessary, we suggest that a two-stage procedure be considered. Because of the hypertonicity of Hyskon, intravascular volume expansion that may be larger than that seen during transurethral prostatectomy occurs. 
Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. Sarcomas arise primarily from mesenchymal structures at any site in the body, even within visceral stroma and neurovascular bundles. Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas. 
Objective antitumor activity of acivicin in patients with recurrent CNS malignancies: a Southwest Oncology Group trial. Acivicin (AT-125) is a glutamine antagonist with dose-limiting, schedule-dependent CNS toxicity and predictable CSF penetration after intravenous administration. Because of these properties, a trial in CNS malignancies was initiated. Thirty-two patients with recurrent or residual malignant astrocytomas were treated with AT-125. The majority of patients had glioblastoma multiforme (24) and had received prior nitrosoureas (21). The median age was 50 years, and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status was 2. The major determinant of response was based upon radiologic criteria using computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor mass was measured in two perpendicular planes, which yielded the largest cross-sectional area. Standard solid tumor criteria for response were used. All responding patients also had a stable or tapered dose of corticosteroids with stable or improved performance status and neurologic examination. There were four objective responses (12%): one complete remission (3 1/2+ years) and three partial remissions (57, 86, and 322 days). Two patients had improvement in disease that did not meet requirements for a partial remission. Toxicity was mild and primarily consisted of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Two patients were removed from study due to neurotoxicity (depression and hallucinations). The strict response criteria used in this trial were not those that have been used in testing other active agents such as carmustine (BCNU). We conclude that AT-125 has objective antitumor activity in malignant astrocytomas and warrants further study. 
Irresectable hepatoma treated by intrahepatic iodized oil doxorubicin hydrochloride: initial results. In this study we describe the investigation and treatment of 14 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were treated with intra-arterial infusion of iodized oil and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Five of these patients were alive after 1 year. Twelve patients showed a fall in alpha-fetoprotein, and in seven of these patients, the fall in alpha-fetoprotein was greater than 50%. 
Eye movement behaviour of patients with cerebral microangiopathy and macroangiopathy in simple visual detection tasks. Patients with cerebral microangiopathy (n = 17), acute and chronic left hemisphere (LH) stroke (n = 18, n = 21) and normal controls (n = 41) were studied in 2 simple visual detection tasks, one with predictable, the other with unpredictable targets. Eye movements were registered by means of infrared light reflections (pupil-corneal reflection method); the points of visual fixation were continuously calculated by a microprocessor system. Patients with cerebral microangiopathy showed primarily difficulties in holding attention, as reflected by pathologically short durations of gaze on target, frequent unsuccessful anticipations and a high overall number of fixations. In contrast, acute LH stroke patients were characterized by a deficit in shifting attention, as reflected by prolonged latencies and long search durations due to many intervening search fixations. By means of a nonparametric discriminant analysis procedure, about 90% of patients with microangiopathy and about 80% of acute LH stroke patients were reliably distinguished from normal controls. The differences between these two patient groups were most pronounced in the simpler task with predictable targets. Among those patients discriminated from normals, about 96% were correctly reclassified as belonging either to the microangiopathy or to the acute LH stroke group on the basis of their abnormal eye movement variables alone. 
Endogenous prostaglandin endoperoxides and prostacyclin modulate the thrombolytic activity of tissue plasminogen activator. Effects of simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptors in a canine model of coronary thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that simultaneous inhibition of TxA2 synthase and blockade of TxA2/PHG2 receptors is more effective in enhancing thrombolysis and preventing reocclusion after discontinuation of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) than either intervention alone. Coronary thrombosis was induced in 35 dogs by placing a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary flow was measured with a Doppler flow probe. 30 min after thrombus formation, the animals received saline (controls, n = 10); SQ 29548 (0.4 mg/kg bolus + 0.4 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); dazoxiben (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2 synthase inhibitor (n = 9); or R 68070 (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a drug that blocks TxA2/PGH2 receptors and inhibits TxA2 synthase (n = 8). Then, all dogs received heparin (200 U/kg) and a bolus of t-PA (80 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (8 micrograms/kg per min) for up to 90 min or until reperfusion was achieved. The time to thrombolysis did not change significantly in SQ 29548-treated dogs as compared with controls (42 +/- 5 vs. 56 +/- 7 min, respectively, P = NS), but it was significantly shortened by R 68070 and dazoxiben (11 +/- 2 and 25 +/- 6 min, respectively, P less than 0.001 vs. controls and SQ 29548-treated dogs). R 68070 administration resulted in a lysis time significantly shorter than that observed in the dazoxiben-treated group (P less than 0.01). Reocclusion was observed in eight of eight control dogs, five of seven SQ 29548-treated dogs, seven of nine dazoxiben-treated dogs, and zero of eight R 68070-treated animals (P less than 0.001). TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, measured in blood samples obtained from the coronary artery distal to the thrombus, were significantly increased at reperfusion and at reocclusion in control animals and in dogs receiving SQ 29548. R 68070 and dazoxiben prevented the increase in plasma TxB2 levels, whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were significantly increased with respect to control and SQ 29548-treated dogs. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of TxA2 synthase and blockade of TxA2/PGH2 receptors is more effective than either intervention alone in this experimental model in enhancing thrombolysis and preventing reocclusion after t-PA administration. 
Systemic hypertension alters vasomotor function in experimental vein grafts. Hypertension is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis, a disease that is important in the pathophysiology of vein graft failure. Hypertension can also alter arterial vasoreactivity. The vasomotor function and histologic characteristics of autogenous vein grafts in hypertensive rabbits were assessed in this study. Hypertension was induced in 13 male New Zealand white rabbits by use of the Goldblatt one clip two kidney method. The right carotid artery was divided and bypassed with the reversed right external jugular vein 7 days later in these animals and in 13 normotensive controls. Blood pressure and renal function were assessed serially, and all the grafts were harvested after 28 days. Three grafts in each group were examined by light microscopy. The responses of the remaining grafts to norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and angiotensin II were determined in vitro under isometric tension. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and calcium ionophore (A23187) was assessed in precontracted grafts. The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased after the Goldblatt procedure was performed. Intimal hyperplasia was observed in both groups, but the grafts in the hypertensive groups showed increased adventitial and medial fibrosis and a reduced number of vasa vasora. The grafts in the hypertensive rabbits were hypersensitive to all agonists as indicated by a significant reduction in their median effective dose values, and their maximal responses to all agonists were also significantly reduced. No graft relaxed in response to acetylcholine, and whereas precontracted grafts in normotensive rabbits had a maximal relaxation of 24% +/- 6% of precontraction with A23187, this was absent in the grafts in the hypertensive rabbits. The results suggest that angiotensin-induced hypertension may adversely affect vein graft patency by inducing hypersensitivity to physiologically important agonists and reducing the effect of receptor-independent endothelium-derived relaxation on vasomotor tone. 
Early experience with low speed rotational angioplasty. OBJECTIVE--Preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of the low speed rotational angioplasty catheter system (ROTACS). DESIGN--Open prospective trial. SETTING--Department of cardiology in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--Eleven patients (10 with chronic stable angina and one with acute coronary occlusion after conventional angioplasty) in whom a coronary angiogram showed occlusion or critical stenosis of the coronary artery (right in seven patients, circumflex in two, and left anterior descending in two). The nature or severity of the lesion ruled out conventional coronary angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS--An attempt was made to cross the lesion with a rotating guide wire with a blunt swelling at its tip. Where necessary progress was assessed by simultaneous injection of contrast into both main coronary arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Progress of the ROTACS through the lesion that allowed a guide wire to pass into the distal vessel was regarded as a device specific success. When a guide wire crossed the lesion aided only by the support of the ROTACS without the use of rotation this was counted as a success that was not device specific. Failure to cross the lesion and any associated complications were noted. RESULTS--The ROTACS crossed only two of the 10 chronic lesions (20% device specific success rate); however, the support it provided enabled a guide wire to cross a further two lesions and allowed subsequent successful angioplasty in four of the 10 patients. One of these four patients presented after five months with recurrent angina requiring bypass grafting. The other three were symptom free at follow up seven months after the procedure. In the one patient with acute coronary occlusion the ROTACS was advanced over the guide wire to allow passage of an angioplasty balloon where this had previously proved impossible. An excellent final result was obtained and this patient remains symptom free. Three of the six patients in whom the ROTACS was unsuccessful had coronary artery dissection without sequelae. Three patients required subsequent elective coronary bypass grafting for control of symptoms while the other three remain well on medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The ROTACS may extend the range of patients with coronary artery occlusion or critical stenosis who can be treated non-surgically. The low device specific success rate (20%) achieved in this study indicates that it should be compared with other simpler mechanical devices that may be just as effective. 
Management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms. A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality. 
Takayasu's disease and atherosclerosis. The aortic arch syndrome characterised by diminished or absent pulses in the arteries arising from the aortic arch has many etiologies, such as syphilitic aortitis, dissection of the aorta, atherosclerosis and Takayasu's arteritis. The diagnostic criteria of Takayasu's arteritis often do not mention histological investigations. We observed a case of an aortic arch syndrome, presenting as a classical case of Takayasu's arteritis but caused by a severe form of atherosclerosis. 
Marginal ulcer following gastric bypass for morbid obesity. Four hundred twelve patients underwent gastric bypass for treatment of morbid obesity between 1981 and 1985 at the University of Florida Affiliated Hospitals. Thirty-four patients (8.2%) developed marginal ulcers, considerably higher than the 0-3 per cent ulcer occurrence commonly reported in the literature. Factors predisposing to ulcer formation include: (1) a large gastric pouch; (2) a vertically oriented pouch; and (3) staple-line dehiscence. Twenty-two of 34 patients (65%) with symptomatic marginal ulcers were noted to have staple-line disruption. Twenty-one of these patients (95%) eventually required operative therapy for their ulcers compared with four of 12 patients (33%) with an intact gastric staple line. Surgical therapy consisted of takedown of the Roux-en-Y limb with resection of the ulcer and gastrogastrostomy. Staple-line dehiscence is a significant etiologic factor in the development of marginal ulcer following gastric bypass and when present constitutes an indication for reoperation. 
Valve extension with glutaraldehyde-preserved autologous pericardium. Results in mitral valve repair. Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue. For this reason, glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989. Ages ranged from 2.5 to 60 years (mean 19 +/- 15). The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever (69%), bacterial endocarditis (17%), congenital (8%), endomyocardial fibrosis (4.5%), and trauma (1.5%). The autologous tissue was fixed in a 0.62% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes. Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion. Associated mitral valve repair techniques (Carpentier's techniques) were mandatory in all patients. The period of follow-up extended from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.1 +/- 2.5 years). There were no operative deaths in this series, and there was one late death (2%). In the six patients (12%) who underwent reoperation, there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch. Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80% of the patients. This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction, allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced. It permits use of an adult-size prosthetic ring in children. Glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair. 
Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis fails to prevent gallbladder mucin hypersecretion in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog Gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog is preceded by an increase in mucin secretion by the gallbladder epithelium, and mucin hypersecretion is believed to promote cholesterol gallstone formation by accelerating the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Some studies have suggested that gallbladder mucin hypersecretion is mediated by increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis, but other observations are difficult to reconcile with this view. An organ culture technique was used to measure mucin secretion in normal prairie dog gallbladder in response to exogenous prostaglandins and agents that increased or decreased endogenous prostaglandin production. Incubation with indomethacin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis with virtually complete inhibition at 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin. However, indomethacin had no effect on gallbladder mucin secretion at concentrations as high as 10(-5) mol/L, and significant inhibition of mucin secretion was only found at 10(-4) mol/L indomethacin, a concentration that also produced a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release from cultured explants. Incubation of gallbladder explants with the calcium ionophore A23187 significantly stimulated endogenous prostaglandin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, increasing synthesis of prostaglandins E and F to as much as 278% +/- 20% and 335% +/- 21% of basal values, respectively; however, the same concentrations of A23187 did not stimulate mucin secretion. Incubation of gallbladder explants in the presence of exogenous prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin F2a in concentrations as high as 10(-6) mol/L also did not stimulate mucin secretion. Prairie dogs fed a lithogenic 1.2% cholesterol diet showed a significant increase in gallbladder mucin secretion after 1 week (117.5 +/- 10.2% of control, P less than 0.05), and 4 of 5 had formed cholesterol monohydrate crystals after 3 weeks. Long-term treatment with indomethacin, 1.2 mg.kg-1.day-1, failed to inhibit gallbladder mucin hypersecretion (129.2 +/- 10.7% of control after 1 week) or cholesterol monohydrate crystal formation (3/5) in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Furthermore, incubation of explants with 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin failed to prevent in vitro mucin hypersecretion in cholesterol-fed animals. These findings suggest that prostaglandins do not regulate gallbladder mucin secretion in the prairie dog, and it is unlikely that increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis are responsible for mediating gallbladder mucin hypersecretion during cholelithiasis in the prairie dog. 
Types of posterior capsular breaks and their surgical implications. We studied the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of posterior capsular breaks in 28 cataract patients during planned extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation surgery. In the age-related cataract group (17 cases), the posterior capsular breaks were fresh, caused by the irrigation-aspiration cannula. Located in the upper part of the posterior capsule, they had thin margins and tended to enlarge with continued irrigation. Nine (52.9%) of these breaks could be plugged with viscoelastic, and after dry aspiration, a posterior chamber lens was implanted successfully. Posterior capsular breaks in traumatic cataracts (11 cases) were preexisting but were detected only during surgery. Centrally located, they had thick fibrosed margins and remained the same size during irrigation- aspiration. The minimal vitreous herniation seen in four (35.3%) of these cases was managed by automated partial anterior vitrectomy through the break. A posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted in all these cases. 
The protective role of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis. The low incidence of atherosclerosis and other degenerative diseases including stone disease in the Greenland Eskimo has been attributed to their high consumption of oily fish with its high concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Man cannot synthesis EPA from the precursor essential fatty acid, linolenic acid, and can only assimilate preformed EPA present in fish and fish oil, to bring about a change in the pathway of eicosanoid metabolism from the n-6 to the n-3 series. With a westernised diet the oxygenated products of renal prostaglandin synthesis are metabolites of the n-6 series and these are known to play an important role in several pathophysiological states including stone disease. Our previous studies have shown a relationship between prostaglandin activity and urinary calcium excretion and it would seem that the initiating factor/s for stone formation trigger the mechanisms for prostaglandin synthesis resulting in the biochemical abnormalities associated with stone disease. The Eskimo may be protected from these events by possession of an eicosanoid metabolism that follows an n-3 pathway. To test this hypothesis experiments were performed using an animal model of nephrocalcinosis. The animals were divided into three groups; one group was given an intra-peritoneal injection of 10% calcium gluconate daily for 10 days to induce nephrocalcinosis; a second group was fed MaxEPA fish oil before and during the calcium gluconate injections and a third group only received an intra-peritoneal injection of N saline. A group of 12 recurrent, hypercalciuric/hyperoxaluric stone-formers were treated with fish oil for eight weeks to study the effects on solute excretion. Nephrocalcinosis, which was readily produced in the control animals, was prevented in the experimental animals by pre-treatment with fish oil and urine calcium excretion was significantly reduced. The urinary calcium and oxalate excretion in the recurrent, hypercalciuric stone-formers was significantly reduced with fish oil treatment over an eight week period. There were no untoward side-effects. These studies indicate that the incorporation of EPA in the diet as a substitute metabolic pathway could be a unique way of correcting the biochemical abnormalities of idiopathic urolithiasis. 
Acute atherosis in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, small-for-gestational-age infants, and diabetes mellitus. A clinicohistologic study of acute atherosis in late complicated pregnancy was undertaken. Maternal vessels in the placental basal plate, underlying the amniochorial membranes and in placental bed biopsy specimens, were examined histologically. The earliest histologically convincing lesion acceptable as acute atherosis was fibrinoid necrosis with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, while lipophages were a late phenomenon. Any maternal uterine vessel that had not undergone physiologic vascular changes could be affected by acute atherosis. Acute atherosis was not seen in normal pregnancies or in pregnancies of diabetic women but was seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, or both. In pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age infants, acute atherosis was not seen in the vessels in the decidua parietalis. 
Comparison of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the postoperative assessment of residual acoustic tumor. Ten patients with surgically confirmed residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas, imaged by both computerized tomography (CT) with iodine contrast and magnetic resonance (MR) with and without gadolinium enhancement, are reviewed to identify the strengths and limitations of MR as compared with CT imaging. MR imaging offers superior anatomic resolution in multiple imaging planes without ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and has adverse effects on some patients. CT imaging offers good anatomic resolution, but in only one or two planes. CT is both less expensive and generally well tolerated, but allergy to the iodine contrast is not uncommon. The cases presented demonstrate the adequacy of CT imaging of residual tumor. However, in some cases MR imaging provided important additional detail. MR imaging also demonstrated postoperative changes within the brain stem and cerebellum. In our experience, CT imaging remains a satisfactory, unambiguous approach to the assessment of known postoperative residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas. MR imaging provides superior resolution, however, and should be used when better definition of tumor detail is needed for management decisions or when multiple follow-up scans are anticipated, so that the exposure to ionizing radiation is limited. MR is also useful to investigate postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Postoperative changes and residual tumors are more difficult to interpret on MR than on CT. Guidelines are proposed to help distinguish residual tumor from postoperative changes and scarring. 
Biased estimates of expected acute myocardial infarction mortality using MedisGroups admission severity groups This study examines whether the MedisGroups admission severity groups give unbiased estimates of 30-day mortality in 3037 Medicare-aged patients who were hospitalized in 1985 through 1986 with acute myocardial infarction. The average observed death rate for all acute myocardial infarction patients in the study who were in a given admission severity group was used to estimate the expected death probability for each case in a given group. (This is the same method used by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for risk adjusting hospital mortality by diagnosis related groups in that state.) When compared with observed deaths, estimates of expected mortality were significantly biased for many patient attributes (eg, age, location of acute myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart failure, serum potassium level, serum urea nitrogen level, pulse rate, and blood pressure). These results are consistent with a conclusion that the MedisGroups scoring algorithm omits some important risk variables, inappropriately includes some other variables reflecting postadmission status, and gives the wrong weights to some appropriate risk variables. To the extent that these findings are also applicable to current MedisGroups scoring algorithms and to other conditions and procedures, MedisGroups admission severity groups cannot fairly adjust for interhospital case mix differences in outcome studies. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Congestive heart failure secondary to an arteriovenous fistula from cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are well known to cause high output cardiac failure. AV fistulae from cardiac catheterization are as rare as 0.01% in the transfemoral approach. We describe here what we believe is the first reported case of high output cardiac failure from an AV fistula due to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patient had reversal of the congestive heart failure with surgical correction of the fistula. 
Stroke in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The thrombosis in myocardial infarction clinical trial and a review of placebo-controlled trials. The frequency of stroke among patients in six recent placebo-controlled trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is reviewed. Three trials used streptokinase and three used tissue plasminogen activator as the thrombolytic agent. While thrombolytic therapy greatly reduces the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction, it increases the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage. 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Cytoreduction and sequential resection: a hope for unresectable primary liver cancer. For decades, unresectable primary liver cancer (PLC) determined by operation was incurable. However, a retrospective study of 24 years' materials with unresectable PLC indicated that 5-year survival of unresectable PLC has increased from 0% in 1966-1977 (n = 137) to 16.9% in 1978-1989 (n = 345). This encouraging improvement was mainly a result of cytoreduction therapy followed by sequential resection. Multimodality combination treatment with hepatic artery ligation, plus hepatic artery infusion with chemotherapy, plus radioimmunotherapy (or radiotherapy) yielded the highest sequential resection rate (30.6%) and 5-year survival (28.0%) as compared with double combination and single modality treatment. The 5-year survival of 33 patients receiving sequential resection after cytoreduction therapy was 63.2%. It is suggested that cytoreduction and sequential resection might offer a hope for surgically verified unresectable PLC. 
Intracranial aneurysms in sickle-cell anemia: clinical features and pathogenesis. Intracranial aneurysms are an unusual complication of sickle-cell anemia; only 15 patients have been described in the world literature. An additional 15 patients with sickle-cell anemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms are presented. There was a high incidence of multiple aneurysms (60%); some of which were in unusual locations. The clinical and pathological features of this series of patients have provided a paradigm for acquired aneurysm formation that may be applicable to other intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy and clip ligation; the perioperative management of these patients is discussed. Of these 13, eight had a good recovery, three were left with moderate disability, one patient died of surgical complications, and one died of complications related to sickle-cell anemia. Two of the 15 patients died of SAH. The authors propose that endothelial injury from the abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium is the initiating event in arterial wall injury. Subsequently, there is fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina and degeneration of the smooth-muscle layer. Hemodynamic stress at these loci of arterial wall damage results in aneurysm formation. This hypothesis also explains other cerebrovascular manifestations of sickle-cell anemia, namely vaso-occlusive disease and hemorrhage without aneurysm formation. Pathological material from this series and data from the literature are presented to support this hypothesis. 
Vitamin B6 is effective therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-nine women completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean "difference in nausea" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05). 
Results of surgery for extratemporal partial epilepsy that began in childhood. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable extratemporal seizures originating in childhood are described. Candidates for surgery were selected on the basis of clinical criteria, neurodiagnostic imaging, and an electroencephalographic investigation that included the use of sphenoidal electrodes and long-term monitoring. Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used. Our results, with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement, are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process. Sixty-three percent of the 35 patients (76.5% of those operated on after the introduction of long-term electroencephalographic monitoring) became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75%. The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy, even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe. 
Visual acuity in infants after vitrectomy for severe retinopathy of prematurity [published erratum apppears in Ophthalmology 1991 Jul;98(7):1005] During the course of the Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP), 98 infants (129 eyes) from the randomized segment of the trial developed total retinal detachment from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) before the 1-year examination. The authors report as a case series the results of acuity card assessment of monocular grating acuity at 1 year in 53 infants (71 eyes) postvitrectomy and in 45 infants (58 eyes) who had retinal detachments but who did not undergo retinal reattachment surgery. The decision to undertake and the surgical technique used for a retinal reattachment procedure was not part of the randomized CRYO-ROP trial. Two eyes of one infant had pattern vision at the lowest measurable threshold after vitrectomy. None of the remaining eyes that had undergone vitrectomy and none of the eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy showed evidence of pattern vision. The relatively poor visual outcomes in this case series suggest that efforts are well-spent in attempting to prevent retinal detachment in ROP. 
Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy and primary sclerosing cholangitis. We report the first case of human T-lymphotropic type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) linked with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The patient, a 44-year-old woman, also suffered from ulcerative colitis and polyarthritis. Two years and nine months after the clinical onset of PSC, the coexistence of HAM was shown by neurological manifestations characterized by slowly progressive symmetrical myelopathy, predominantly involving pyramidal tracts, and positive antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid. 
Operative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. 
Hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation after coronary artery bypass grafting. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients may remain at risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias. The hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation and the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine pretreatment were studied after CABG surgery and overnight mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) patients who had tracheal extubation after pretreatment with a placebo; group 2 patients who received lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) before tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic data, electrocardiographic tracings, and arterial blood gases were obtained before tracheal extubation, during suctioning, and 1, 5, and 20 min after tracheal extubation. Group 1 patients displayed significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, right atrial pressure, and cardiac index during suctioning and within 1 min of tracheal extubation, returning to preextubation level by 5 min. There were no significant changes in pulmonary and systemic resistance indices. Hemodynamic changes in group 2 patients were similar to those in group 1. Both in the absence and presence of lidocaine, tracheal extubation caused hemodynamic responses that were small in magnitude and brief in duration. These responses were not associated with electrocardiographic or enzymatic evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or with ventricular dysrhythmias. Compared with the well-documented hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, we found that extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery was associated with less pronounced responses. This may be related to avoidance of laryngoscopy and possibly accommodation to the endo-tracheal tube. These modest hemodynamic responses of extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery were not modified by intravenous lidocaine. 
The effect of positive reinforcement on hourly compliance in nasal continuous positive airway pressure users with obstructive sleep apnea. Previous reports have described compliance with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) only in terms of the number of patients able to use it beyond their initial trial night or those continuing after some home use. Because of a possible difference between the level of compliance (mean number of hours of use per 24 h) needed for symptomatic relief of OSA versus cardiovascular improvement, the level of hourly compliance in chronic nCPAP users may be important. The first part of this study prospectively examines compliance in a stable population of OSA patients already using nCPAP for 6 months to 2 yr. The second part is a prospective randomized, crossover study examining the effect of weekly (three times) then monthly (twice) positive reinforcement on hourly compliance of new nCPAP users for 3 months versus no reinforcement for 3 months. Positive reinforcement consisted of telephone discussions with the patients about the severity or complications of OSA, benefits of nCPAP, and suggestions about minimizing side effects. Using self-assessment scales, each patient reported the perceived level of improvement from the untreated to the treated condition and the prevalence and severity of side effects from the nCPAP therapy. The level of compliance in stable, chronic nCPAP users with OSA was 6.1 +/- 2.2 h/24 h (n = 9). For the new nCPAP users during the nonreinforced period, the mean compliance was 6.0 +/- 2.8 h/24 h; that during the reinforcement period was 6.0 +/- 2.7 h/24 h (NS). There was no significant correlation between perceived improvement in OSA symptoms or between the perceived side effects of nCPAP versus hourly compliance. 
Prostatic abscess after transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. We report a case of a diabetic man who had bilateral prostatic abscesses after ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate. As is typical of prostatic abscesses, the diagnosis was not evident at presentation. We discuss the morbidity of transrectal biopsy and recommend consistent antimicrobial prophylaxis. We also recommend transrectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of such abscesses, and support the standard treatment of drainage and parenteral antimicrobial therapy. We anticipate that the incidence of prostatic abscess will increase due to the increasing number of men undergoing transrectal biopsy in the current age of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. 
Trunk orientation as the determining factor of the 'contralateral' deficit in the neglect syndrome and as the physical anchor of the internal representation of body orientation in space. The present study examines which egocentric coordinate system determines the border between the disturbed 'contralateral' and the normal 'ipsilateral' side in patients with hemineglect. Based on the observation of significantly longer reaction times for saccades towards stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) in right brain-damaged patients with hemineglect, stimuli were presented randomly to the LVF or RVF and the corresponding saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were compared. Beginning with the standard body position generally used for the investigation of neglect patients, where the midlines of head, trunk and visual field are parallel and oriented straight towards the middle of the projection screen, the spatial relation between orientation of head and trunk midlines and location of the target stimuli was systematically varied while holding the retinal projection of the stimuli constant. The deficit in SRTs towards the LVF in 4 right brain-damaged patients with left-sided hemineglect could be compensated for by turning the patients' trunk to the left, such that both LVF and RVF-stimuli were projected to the right, ipsilateral side of trunk space. The results suggest that the spatial orientation of the trunk midline divides our normal perception of space into an egocentric 'left' and an egocentric 'right' sector and seems to be the decisive factor for determining the neglected 'contralateral' part of space in patients with brain-damage. They indicate that the trunk midline constitutes the physical anchor for calculation of the internal egocentric coordinate frame for representing body position with respect to external objects. The hypothesis of Ventre et al. (1984) that deficient reactions to contralaterally located stimuli in neglect patients could be the result of a displacement of these egocentric coordinates towards the non-neglected, ipsilateral side is discussed. 
Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. Traditionally, the treatment of esophageal strictures in children has been done with mercury bougies in a prograde fashion or with Tucker dilators passed along a guide wire in a retrograde manner. An alternative approach has used a balloon dilatation catheter passed over a guide wire previously placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Over the past 5 years, this technique has been used in 43 procedures for both discrete and diffuse strictures. The interventions were performed in a total of 15 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years. In all cases, there was improvement of the preceding symptoms following dilatation. This report details the experience with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, emphasizing the indications, contraindications, and potential complications associated with balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. 
A lesson from the controversy about heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression. To summarize the literature review, the heart rate adjustment appears to be able to perfectly discriminate patients with different numbers of diseased coronary vessels in one center, to increase the diagnostic accuracy of three-vessel or left main disease in eight centers, and unable to improve accuracy in seven centers. To explain those differences, several methodological and statistical biases have been considered. However, a recent report regarding the application of the method in eight centers and a meticulous literature review could not explain the superior performance in some laboratories. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
Psychosis following temporal lobe surgery: a report of six cases. Six consecutive patients who had had temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy, and been referred for psychiatric assessment of psychotic symptoms, are reported. Their symptoms (a delusional depression, four schizophrenia-like illnesses, and a case of Capgras' syndrome) are discussed in relation to the possible role of their operations, all of which were on the right hemisphere. 
Diastolic mitral regurgitation with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities: relation of mitral flow velocity to transmitral pressure gradients in conscious dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation is a common finding that can be detected with use of Doppler echocardiographic techniques in patients with atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. With use of simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler techniques, mitral flow velocity, mitral valve motion and transmitral pressure gradient were studied during 50 cardiac cycles each of spontaneous or atrial paced first- and second-degree AV block in five lightly sedated dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation was detected during atrial relaxation on all beats in which ventricular contraction was delayed greater than 190 ms. In all dogs the diastolic regurgitation was associated with a reverse transmitral pressure gradient (3.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) that occurred primarily as the result of a decrease in atrial pressure with atrial relaxation. These reverse pressure gradients were as large as the maximal forward transmitral gradients in early diastole (2.9 +/- 0.9 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) and larger than the maximal forward pressure gradients at atrial contraction (1.7 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). The maximal reverse pressure gradient during atrial relaxation was also as large as the reverse pressure gradient in mid-diastole (2.7 +/- 0.9 and 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, respectively), associated with deceleration of early diastolic mitral flow. Peak diastolic mitral regurgitation velocity coincided with the maximal reverse transmitral gradient and was usually larger than anterograde mitral flow velocity. 
A prospective comparison of class IA, B, and C antiarrhythmic agents in combination with amiodarone in patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachycardia BACKGROUND. Clinical experience suggests that combinations of antiarrhythmic agents provide more effective control of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than does therapy with single agents. METHODS AND RESULTS. Antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of three class I antiarrhythmic agents, one from each subclass A, B, and C, were assessed in single use and in combination with amiodarone in patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachycardia that was not suppressed by monotherapy with these agents. Thirty-one patients underwent an electrophysiology test on four occasions: at baseline; after 2-4 days of treatment with quinidine, mexiletine, or encainide; after 2 weeks of treatment with 1,200 mg/day amiodarone; and last, after 2-4 days of treatment with both amiodarone and the previously tested class I agent. The combination of a class I agent and amiodarone prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in only one of 31 (3%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia became hemodynamically stable in 11 of 31 (34%) patients because of a marked prolongation in the tachycardia cycle length. It increased from 323 +/- 39 to 423 +/- 84 msec (n = 11, p less than 0.01) by adding encainide to amiodarone therapy, and it showed a tendency to lengthen when quinidine was added to amiodarone (from 373 +/- 77 to 425 +/- 58 msec; n = 10, NS). Each class I agent increased amiodarone-induced depression in myocardial conduction, but the extent of the additional depression seemed to differ among the three subclasses. Ventricular refractoriness was increased by all class I agents when used in combination with amiodarone, although not by mexiletine or encainide when used alone. CONCLUSIONS. Class I antiarrhythmic agents slow ventricular conduction and increase ventricular refractoriness when used in combination with amiodarone. When amiodarone and class I drugs by themselves do not suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia, the combination of amiodarone and a class I agent seldom results in noninducibility; however, it often lengthens the ventricular tachycardia cycle length and may render the ventricular tachycardia hemodynamically stable. 
Interleukin 4 is important in protective immunity to a gastrointestinal nematode infection in mice. Parasitic helminths typically induce components of immediate-type hypersensitivity, including elevated serum IgE, eosinophilia, and mucosal mast cells. These responses are T-cell-dependent and associated with rapid expulsion of parasitic worms from a sensitized host; existing experimental systems have failed to define the precise role of cytokines in these responses. We report here that anti-interleukin 4 or anti-interleukin 4 receptor antibodies block the polyclonal IgE response to a parasitic nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and abrogate protective immunity to the infection. In contrast, anti-interleukin 5 antibody prevented H. polygyrus-induced eosinophilia but did not prevent protection. These data provide evidence that a specific cytokine affects the physiology and survival of a parasitic nematode in the host. 
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in systemic sclerosis and primary pulmonary hypertension. Reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by a high inspired oxygen concentration is a common, but not universal phenomenon in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of varying etiology that may determine their response to long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy. We therefore determined changes in PVR during oxygen therapy in two patient populations not previously studied: systemic sclerosis (n = 8, mean age +/- SEM, 44.5 +/- 5.4 years) and primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 7, mean age +/- SEM 38 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were hypoxemic (arterial oxygen tension, on air 9.5 +/- 1.2 kPa for SSc and 8.3 +/- 0.6 kPa for PPH, p greater than 0.05). Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic arterial pressure, PaO2 and cardiac output by thermodilution were measured at three, 20-min intervals while inspiring air and again after inspiring 60 percent oxygen for 30 min. The PVR fell significantly with oxygen in patients with SSc from 797.6 +/- 179.2 to 610 +/- 151.6 dynes/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.01), and this fall correlated with baseline PAP and PaO2 prior to oxygen therapy (r = 0.86, p less than 0.025; r = 0.77, p less than 0.05, respectively). In patients with PPH, there was no significant fall in PVR with oxygen (from 969 +/- 80.2 to 851.9 +/- 91.2 dynes/s/cm-5, p greater than 0.05) and no predictor of a vasodilator response in individual patients. In SSc, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes more consistently to elevated PVR than in patients with PPH. 
Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to tumor with normal exam, responsive to carbamazepine. Trigeminal neuralgia is most commonly idiopathic, although it can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Tumors are rare causes of trigeminal neuralgia. A case is presented of trigeminal neuralgia with normal neurological examination and responsive to carbamazepine, secondary to a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Literature relative to neoplastic etiologies of trigeminal neuralgia is reviewed. The role of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia is considered. A normal neurological examination and responsiveness to carbamazepine do not exclude tumor as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. 
Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in elderly patients in a primary care setting. Despite the aging of our population, there remains a paucity of information about gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the elderly. To assess the prevalence and characteristics of GER within this patient population, questionnaires evaluating symptoms associated with GER were administered to 313 consecutive patients 62 yr old or older from a primary care setting. Fourteen percent of these patients reported having at least weekly heartburn. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was accomplished in 54 of the 313 patients surveyed. Twenty percent (11/54) of this subgroup exhibited increased acid contact time (pH less than 4 for more than 6% of the monitoring period). Twenty-two percent (12/54) complained of heartburn, yet only six individuals (11%) exhibited both symptomatic and objective indications of acid reflux. Surprisingly, 31% (17/54) of the patients studied exhibited significant alkalinity within the distal esophagus (pH greater than 8 for greater than 1.5% of the monitoring period). Whereas 29% of these patients (5/17) reported heartburn, 40% of those reporting heartburn (2/5) had acid GER as well as excessive alkalinity. In contrast to patients with acid GER--none of whom reported pulmonary symptoms--24% (4/17) of these patients with esophageal alkalinity reported wheezing, nocturnal cough, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of the four patients with significant distal esophageal exposure to both acid and alkali, two reported heartburn and a third reported dysphagia. In addition to the somewhat higher prevalence of acid reflux than anticipated, a surprisingly high prevalence of esophageal alkalinity was observed. 
Impact of intraoperative echocardiography on surgical management of congenital heart disease. Intraoperative echocardiography was performed by epicardial, 2-dimensional, low- and high-pulsed repetition frequency, continuous-wave Doppler and color flow mapping in 50 patients. Forty studies were performed before and 44 studies after cardiopulmonary bypass. Studies before cardiopulmonary bypass agreed with preoperative evaluation. After cardiopulmonary bypass, studies revealed that 11 of 25 patients who underwent repair of ventricular septal defects had residual ventricular septal defects, and 1 of 25 patients who underwent atrial septal repair had 1 residual atrial communication. One patient with a "Swiss cheese" ventricular septum underwent repeat cardiopulmonary bypass to close residual ventricular septal defects. The patient with a residual atrial communication required immediate reoperation because of a right to left shunt after a modified Fontan procedure. Eight of 10 remaining residual ventricular septal defects spontaneously closed 1 to 41 days after operation. Assessment of postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative valvular regurgitation in 21 valves revealed good correlation (p less than 0.01). However, 1 patient required reoperation for mitral valve replacement on the sixth postoperative day. The correlation was fair between postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative residual stenotic pressure gradients in 12 surgically repaired stenotic lesions. This study shows that little additional information is added to a comprehensive preoperative evaluation by precardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography. Postcardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography is useful in identifying residual shunts. Assessment of stenotic gradients and valvular regurgitation must be interpreted in light of a changing hemodynamic state. 
Intensive combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation leads to the reappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fifteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or alpha-interferon therapy were included in this study. Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission. 
Is combined modality therapy appropriate for apparently localized carcinoma of the prostate? In a pilot study at the authors' institution, 17 patients with stage C carcinoma of the prostate had preoperative therapy with diethylstilbestrol. After 8 to 12 weeks of DES at 3 mg per day, the surgical margins, seminal vesicles, and pelvic lymph nodes were free of tumor in seven patients. In one patient, no residual tumor could be found despite an extensive search, and in two other cases, only small foci of atypical cells could be found. The authors suggest a trial of the proper role of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in stages B2 and C prostatic carcinoma. 
Reconstitution of an active surface CD2 by DNA transfer in CD2-CD3+ Jurkat cells facilitates CD3-T cell receptor-mediated IL-2 production. To investigate the requirements for CD2 expression in the activation of T lymphocytes via the CD3-TCR complex, we produced and characterized a series of CD2-variants of the IL-2 producing Jurkat leukemia cell line, J32 (surface phenotype, CD2+, CD3+, CD28+). These mutants were derived by radiation and immunoselection, and were cloned under limiting dilution conditions. A total of 3 out of 30 of these mutants selectively lost the expression of both CD2 surface molecules and CD2 mRNA, and retained the expression of the CD3-TCR complex and the CD28 molecule. A mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 antibodies (9.6 + 9-1) failed to stimulate activation of these variants as measured by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and by IL-2 production. The CD2- mutants stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb revealed an 8- to 32-fold decrease in IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation as compared with the parental cells. No alteration of CD3-TCR-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was observed in the CD2- mutants. Reconstitution of CD2 expression by gene transfer in two J32 CD2- mutants restored IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation in responses to both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3-TCR mAb. These results are the first direct demonstration of the requirement for CD2 molecules in optimizing IL-2 response in human T cells stimulated via CD3-TCR complex. 
The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid in an animal tumor model. This study used an established rabbit tumor model with squamous carcinoma to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of technetium-99m-(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid. A total of 54 rabbits were studied (25 with no tumor; 29 with tumor). Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a bi-exponential blood clearance in rabbits with no tumors (28 and 325 min) and in rabbits with tumors (27 and 352 min). There was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in mean clearance times between the two groups and clearance appeared unaffected by tumor mass. Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a bi-exponential cumulative urine excretion with no apparent difference in half-times between non-tumor and tumor rabbit groups (200 and 240 min, respectively). Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid had a major organ biodistribution in rabbits which included bone, kidneys, bladder and the blood pool. The major route of excretion was via the urine. There was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in organ biodistribution between rabbits with no tumors and rabbits with tumors and there was no evidence of active uptake of technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid by either squamous carcinoma or inflammatory tissue. 
Coordination of swallowing and respiration in unconscious subjects. We investigated the coordination of swallowing and breathing in 11 unconscious patients with an endotracheal tube in place during the recovery period from general anesthesia. Swallows occurred during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases with no preponderant occurrence during either phase. When a swallow occurred during inspiration, the inspiration was interrupted immediately and was followed by expiration, but the durations of both inspiration and expiration were progressively increased as the time from the onset of inspiration to the onset of swallowing was progressively delayed. A swallow coinciding with the expiratory phase progressively prolonged the duration of the expiration that had been interrupted as the timing of swallowing was progressively delayed. Repeated swallows invariably and in a predictable manner caused changes in the breathing pattern. Thus when the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively high, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, shallow, and rapid breaths. When the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively low, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, deep, and slow breaths. When the frequency of repeated swallows was irregular, the breathing patterns were characterized by inconsistent changes in tidal volume and respiratory frequency. Our results indicate that, in unconscious subjects, some mechanisms integrating respiration and swallowing are operative and responsible for changes in breathing patterns during swallowing. 
Antihypertensive drug therapy and survival by treatment status in a national survey. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, an investigation of a cohort originally examined during the period 1971-1975, provided an opportunity to assess the frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in the United States during the period 1982-1984. For most age-sex-race subgroups, the frequency of medication use during 1982-1984 was higher than that observed during 1976-1980 based on the NHANES II. In the interval 1982-1984, diuretic agents were the most frequent medications prescribed (47% of drugs prescribed), and beta-blockers were second (17%). At the time of the initial survey in 1971-1975, participants had their blood pressures measured and a history of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension ascertained. Follow-up for vital status was 93% complete by 1984 (average length of follow-up, 9 years). In white men and women aged 50 years and older, the relative risk of death increased steadily, from those with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) but no history of hypertension to those treated for hypertension but whose blood pressure was still elevated. Regardless of history or treatment, those with an elevated blood pressure had about a 25-30% excess risk of death. Evidence from these national studies shows a high frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in 1982-1984 and suggests the importance of adequate blood pressure control for optimal survival. 
Thromboprophylaxis in patients with hip fractures: a prospective, randomized, comparative study between Org 10172 and dextran 70. A prospective, randomized, assessor-blind trial has been undertaken to compare the thromboprophylactic effect and safety of the heparinoid Org 10172 (a mixture of low molecular-weight sulfated glycosaminoglycuronides) and dextran 70 in patients operated on for hip fracture. Prestudy biostatistical calculations led to the need for 260 patients. Three hundred eight patients were randomized and 19 were excluded after randomization, the majority because of postponed surgery. Analyses were made on the 289 patients on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as on the 247 patients given correct prophylaxis. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was based on bilateral ascending phlebography on postoperative days 10 through 12. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis on an intention-to-treat basis was 10% in the Org 10172 group and 30% in the dextran 70 group and, on the basis of correct prophylaxis, 12% and 31%, respectively, both differences being significant (p less than 0.001). Two-month mortality rates were equal in the groups. Three fatal pulmonary emboli were seen in the dextran group. Significantly more patients in the dextran group received postoperative transfusions; no other differences in various hemorrhagic parameters were seen. Thus it can be concluded that Org 10172 has a significantly better thromboprophylactic effect than does dextran in patients with hip fractures without significant side effects. 
Evaluation of the abdomen in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography scan or peritoneal lavage always indicated? STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the necessity of intensive evaluation of the intoxicated patient with normal mentation for intra-abdominal injury after blunt torso trauma. DESIGN: Retrospective study; trauma registry and medical records. SETTING: Level I regional trauma center serving a population of 2.3 million. PARTICIPANTS: Adult victims of blunt trauma more than 17 years old, admitted between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, with suspected blunt abdominal injury and serum ethanol of more than 100 mg/dL and Glasgow Coma Score of 15. INTERVENTION: All patients had serum ethanol levels measured in mg/dL and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and/or diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). RESULTS: Criteria were met by 92 patients. Eighty-nine underwent CT scans, two had DPL, and one had both. Of 17 patients complaining of abdominal pain and/or tenderness on palpation, six (35.3%) had blood in the peritoneal cavity demonstrated by CT scan or DPL and underwent celiotomy. All 75 patients without abdominal pain or tenderness had negative CT scan or DPL, with no missed injury. CONCLUSION: In the intoxicated blunt trauma patient with normal mentation, the physical examination is a reliable indicator of abdominal injury. Elevated alcohol level, per se, should not be considered an absolute indication for DPL or abdominal CT. 
Reversibility of blue-gray cutaneous discoloration from amiodarone. A 45-year-old man had severe blue-gray cutaneous discoloration during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, this drug regimen was discontinued, and long-term anticoagulation and digoxin therapy were used. The patient was advised to avoid exposure of his skin to sunlight, and a bleaching agent was prescribed. After 18 months of follow-up, the blue-gray hyperpigmentation had diminished. Although photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone occur in more than 50% of patients, blue-gray cutaneous discoloration occurs in less than 10% of patients on prolonged therapy with amiodarone. The presence of high concentrations of iodine, detected by electron probe analysis, suggests that the cutaneous deposits are amiodarone itself or a metabolite. The slow rate of elimination of amiodarone and a high uptake by fat-associated tissues may explain the delayed disappearance of cutaneous photosensitivity and late resolution of the blue-gray discoloration. Our current case supports the reversibility of these adverse effects on long-term follow-up. 
Duodenobronchial fistula. Duodenobronchial fistulas are an extremely rare subgroup of abdominobronchial fistulas, which include bronchobiliary, gastrobronchial, enterobronchial, colobronchial, and splenobronchial fistulas. Only one case of a duodenobronchial fistula has been previously reported. Duodenobronchial fistulas occur as a complication of a duodenal injury. The characteristic symptoms are a cough that produces copious bilious secretions, shortness of breath, and fever. The diagnosis is made by contrast gastrointestinal studies. Treatment requires an abdominal approach with interruption of the fistula at its duodenal origin and control of the inciting inflammatory process. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, thoracic drainage or pulmonary resection should not be needed. 
Valgus high tibial osteotomy. A long-term follow-up study. One hundred twenty-eight knees in 107 patients with osteoarthrosis treated by valgus high tibial osteotomy were clinically reviewed. Patients were reviewed from three to 15 years postoperatively (mean, 7.5 years). The revision rate in the osteoarthrotic population was 10.9%. Patients who were older than 60 years of age at the time of surgery had results comparable to those patients who were younger than 60 years of age at the time of surgery. Women and men appeared to have a similar prognosis; 79.6% good and excellent results up to nine years; at ten to 15 years, 70% good and excellent. 
Ischemic necrosis: a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of spontaneously ruptured enterocystoplasty. Spontaneous enterocystoplasty rupture represents a devastating and potentially fatal late complication. Previously proposed mechanisms of rupture include catheter trauma, chronic infection, avulsion of adhesions between the bowel patch and peritoneum, and chronic overdistension with elevated intravesical pressures. We have witnessed this complication 4 times in 3 patients 5 weeks to 46 months postoperatively. Tissue specimens from 3 episodes in 2 patients with detubularized sigmoid enterocystoplasties were available for histological examination. All patients had a neurogenic bladder from myelomeningocele, all had an AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter and all had a documented history of chronic distension from inadequate emptying of the augmented bladder. At exploration, all of the ruptures were found within the bowel segment near the bladder apex in an area remote from the anastomotic line. In each case tissue specimens from the rupture site showed marked vascular congestion, intramural hemorrhage, abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages, myofiber atrophy and intravascular thrombi. These features are interpreted to reflect the sequelae of vascular compromise and ischemia. We propose that enterocystoplasty rupture results from ischemia, possibly due to chronic overdistension and subsequent vascular compromise. This mechanism may account for many of the previously reported cases of enterocystoplasty rupture. 
Cranial vault and gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst in a young woman. The case of a young woman (20 years) with a gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst (110 x 90 x 65 mm) is presented. The first manifestation was a grand mal seizure followed by symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The origin of the cyst was in the diploe of the right cheek, frontal, temporal, and parietal bones. An osteoplastic craniotomy was performed, and more than 100 fertile daughter cysts were removed, together with the wall of the cyst. A modification in the standard operative procedure is proposed for gigantic cysts that emerge from the diploe of the cranial vault and extend intracranially. Therapy with dexamethasone and phenobarbital was instituted preoperatively and continued postoperatively. The 3-month follow-up showed no relapse. 
Interrupted aortic arch with tetralogy of Fallot. A report of an unsuccessful surgically treated case. Interrupted aortic arch is a complete discontinuity of two segments of the aorta. Although associated with a number of conditions, it does not occur in association with pulmonary stenosis. We report a case unsuccessfully treated but from which we have learnt a lesson. 
Amiloride delays the ischemia-induced rise in cytosolic free calcium. An increase in cytosolic free calcium (Cai) has been shown to occur early during ischemia in perfused rat, ferret, and rabbit hearts. It has been proposed that this increase in Cai may occur as a result of exchange of Nai for Cao, which occurs as a result of an increase in Nai arising from exchange of Nao for H+i. The latter exchange is stimulated by the intracellular acidification that occurs during ischemia. To test this hypothesis, we examined Cai, Nai, ATP, and pHi during ischemia in rats in the presence and absence of 1 mM amiloride, a Na-H exchange inhibitor. Cai was measured using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (5F-BAPTA)-loaded rat hearts. Nai was measured using 23Na NMR, and the shift reagent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetramethylenephosph onate (Tm[DOTP]-5) was used to separate Nai and Nao. ATP and pH were determined from 31P NMR measurements. During 20 minutes of ischemia, amiloride did not significantly alter the ATP decline but did significantly attenuate the rise in Nai and Cai. After 20 minutes of ischemia, time-averaged Cai was 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM (mean +/- SEM) in amiloride-treated hearts compared with 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM in nontreated hearts. After 20 minutes of ischemia, Nai in the untreated heart was threefold greater than control, whereas in the amiloride-treated heart, Nai was not significantly different from control. These data are consistent with the involvement of Na-Ca exchange in the rise in Cai during ischemia. 
Management of the pregnant woman with spinal cord injuries. This paper forms part of an ongoing prospective study of pregnancy and labour in women with spinal cord injuries and combines a prospective and retrospective analysis of 17 pregnancies in 15 women with spinal injuries. The management and outcome in those 17 pregnancies is reviewed. 
Severe lactic acidosis related to acute thiamine deficiency. The authors report a case of severe lactic acidosis in a 3-year-old boy, after 20 days of total parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation. This child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent a period of severe refractory lactic acidosis (pH between 6.81 and 7.00 and a serum lactate level up to 38 mmol/liter) leading to cardiac arrest. After the initial resuscitation and the subsequent treatment of shock and vitamin K deficiency, acute peritoneal dialysis was instituted to correct the severe lactic acidosis. Initial low plasma thiamine levels confirmed the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. An associated transient pancreatic dysfunction was also noted. The patient's overall course with thiamine replacement therapy led to a complete recovery within 5 days and no sequelae were noted after 12 months. 
Concomitant pelvic irradiation, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in the treatment of advanced cervical carcinoma. This was a Phase II study of 24 late (FIGO) Stage IIb and 39 Stage III patients. External beam radiotherapy was given daily, five days a week, using 15 x 15 cm parallel opposed pelvic fields. The first 20 patients had 45.00 Gy mid-plane dose in 20 fractions, Days 1-28, the last 43 patients had 50.40 Gy in 28 fractions, Days 1-43. This was followed by an intracavitary boost of 17.00 Gy to Point A in two fractions over seven days. The first seven patients had concomitant 5-fluorouracil (5FU) 1 g/m2/day (maximum 1.5 g/day) Days 2-5, 30-33 and 57-60, with mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 (maximum 15 mg) Days 2 and 57. Two patients had WHO Grade 4 cytopenia, and only two were able to have full dose intensity. The 5FU dose was reduced to 0.8 g/m2/day, for Days 2-5 and 30-33; mitomycin C was given on Day 2 only. Treatment morbidity with the reduced chemotherapy intensity was comparable with that of radiotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 6-44). Median survival was 35 months. The results were compared with historical controls treated using the same radiation method alone. Two-year survival for late Stage IIb patients was 67% with the combination and 72% with radiotherapy alone; for Stage III, 67% and 49% respectively. Two-year pelvic control for late Stage IIb was 87% (combination) and 84% (radiotherapy alone) and for Stage III, 61% and 55% respectively. In contrast to reports from other centres, these results do not show an overall significant improvement on radiotherapy alone. A Phase III study may not be practicable. 
Chest wall motion during epidural anesthesia in dogs. To determine the relative contribution of rib cage and abdominal muscles to expiratory muscle activity during quiet breathing, we used lumbar epidural anesthesia in six pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs lying supine to paralyze the abdominal muscles while leaving rib cage muscle motor function substantially intact. A high-speed X-ray scanner (Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor) provided three-dimensional images of the thorax. The contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing was assessed by a comparison of chest wall configuration during relaxed apnea with that at end expiration. We found that expiratory muscle activity was responsible for approximately half of the changes in thoracic volume during inspiration. Paralysis of the abdominal muscles had little effect on the pattern of breathing, including the contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing, in most dogs. We conclude that, although there is consistent phasic expiratory electrical activity in both the rib cage and the abdominal muscles of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs lying supine, the muscles of the rib cage are mechanically the most important expiratory muscles during quiet breathing. 
Usefulness of a pericardial friction rub after thrombolytic therapy during acute myocardial infarction in predicting amount of myocardial damage. The TAMI Study Group. To evaluate the clinical incidence and outcomes of patients with pericarditis after thrombolytic therapy, 810 patients were prospectively studied during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis was defined as the presence of a pericardial friction rub during the hospital course. Only 5% of patients developed a rub during AMI, a low percent compared with that in the prethrombolytic era. A pericardial friction rub more often occurred in the setting of an anterior wall AMI. Patients with, compared to those without, a pericardial friction rub had lower ejection fractions (45 vs 51%, p = 0.002); worse regional left ventricular function (-3.2 vs 2.7, standard deviation per chord); higher in-hospital mortality (15 vs 6%, p = 0.056); a higher frequency of power failure (83 vs 57%); a higher frequency of anterior wall location of the AMI (53% of cases, p = 0.002); and a higher frequency of 3-vessel disease. Therefore, although the frequency of a pericardial friction rub was low (5%) compared with that in the prethrombolytic era, its occurrence denotes more extensive myocardial damage with a worse clinical outcome. Perhaps with successful reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel, transmural myocardial necrosis is prevented and with it the development of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a pericardial friction rub. 
Analysis of anti-tumor antibodies in mice and rabbits induced by monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies. Eight different mouse monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies (mAb2) generated against a mouse monoclonal anti-human melanoma proteoglycan Ag (MPG) antibody (mAb1), MEM136, were tested for their ability to induce anti-MPG responses in mice and rabbits. All Ab2 were idiotypically cross-reactive and combining site-specific as demonstrated by competitive cross-inhibition studies and their ability to inhibit the binding of MEM136 to the melanoma cells, Colo38. However, only two Ab2, IM32 and IM06, were able to induce specific anti-TAA-specific (Ab1') responses in rabbits. When IM32 and IM06 were tested in allogeneic stains of mice for the induction of anti-MPG responses, only IM32 produced an Ab1' response. In mice, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 is idiotypically cross-reactive with its Ab1. Furthermore, the IM32-induced murine Ab3 and MEM136 recognized a similar MPG epitope on the melanoma cells because the Ab3 inhibited the binding of MEM136 to melanoma cells. The Ab3 induced by IM32 and IM06 in rabbits also recognized a similar epitope as the Ab1. In rabbits, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 and IM06 were idiotypically cross-reactive with each other. However, additional studies indicated that the majority of Ab3 induced by IM32 were IM32 Id-specific and lacked IM06 idiotopes. Further experimentation indicated that IM32-induced rabbit Ab3 were biologically active as demonstrated by the ability of the Ab3 to inhibit melanoma cell invasion in a Matrigel assay. 
Sphincter-sparing surgery. Since World War II, a variety of technical innovations have been introduced to preserve the anal sphincter in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis or tumors of the rectum. Studies of anorectal physiology have yielded guidelines for preserving continence and minimizing morbidity. For example, preservation of the anal rectal angle is essential; the rectal mucosa can be removed without impairing neural mechanisms; construction of a reservoir increases rectal compliance. Following these guidelines, surgeons have introduced new techniques and applications benefiting a larger and more varied patient population. Some technical problems remain, however, and patient selection criteria for restorative rectal surgery need to be refined. 
Stenting of coronary arteries: has a modern Pandora's box been opened? Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including coronary stenting. Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty. 
Low incidence of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis in London confirmed by hepatitis C virus serology To see whether the introduction of screening tests for post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in the UK would be worth while, the incidence of such hepatitis was assessed among patients receiving blood during operations at five hospitals served by the North London Blood Transfusion Centre. 387 patients, who each received blood or blood components from an average of 3 donors were followed up prospectively and blood samples were taken every 2 weeks for 3 months and then each month for a further 3 months. 229 patients also provided a sample at 12 months. All available patient and donor samples were tested for alanine aminotransferase concentrations and for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by ELISA. Repeatedly anti-HCV positive samples were submitted to supplementary HCV assays. 1 of the 387 patients showed biochemical evidence of acute post-transfusion NANBH after exclusion of non-viral causes. Anti-HCV developed in this patient and the seroconversion was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction. Serum from 1 of the 8 donors whose blood he received was positive for anti-HCV by all three methods. In another patient HCV seroconversion was shown by ELISA but alanine aminotransferase concentrations remained normal throughout follow-up. His samples and those of his 2 donors were negative for HCV by the polymerase chain reaction. A third patient showed rises in alanine aminotransferase compatible with post-transfusion NANBH, but serology and polymerase chain reaction assays for HCV were negative for her samples and those of her donors. Anti-HCV reactivity likely to be false positive (negative by both confirmatory tests and no adverse effects in recipients) was seen in 6 of 1283 donors. This study, despite its being carried out in the part of the UK with the highest frequency of infectious markers in blood donations, has shown a very low incidence of post-transfusion NANBH. 
Mechanisms of gastric mucosal injury and protection. This article emphasizes and reviews the premise that because the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury is multifactorial, several protective mechanisms should also be considered in analyzing gastric mucosal defense. The first part of the article reviews the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury by major etiologic factors such as hypoxia and chemical and biological agents, and emphasizes the common endogenous mediators of damage (e.g, endothelins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, monoamines, free radicals, proteases, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids--in decreasing potency). The second part of the review is devoted to the gastroprotective mechanisms that are analyzed by anatomical (histologic) location and biochemical processes. The endogenous mediators of acute gastroprotection include prostaglandins, sulfhydryl (SH) compounds, non-SH antioxidants, polyamines, and epidermal growth factor, whereas the protective and mediatory role of glucocorticoids, somatostatin, pentagastrin, histamine, gangliosides, and calcitonin gene-related peptide need further studies. A list of endogenous and exogenous chemicals that exert biphasic, damaging, and protective effects on the gastric mucosa in also included. The final common pathway of acute gastroprotection at the structural and functional level seems to be the preservation of subepithelial microvascular integrity leading to maintenance of mucosal blood flow that allows the energy-dependent rapid restitution (cell migration) from surviving gastric neck cells to repair the superficial epithelial defect. Very new data on the contribution of a histodilutional barrier and release of proteases to gastroprotective processes are also discussed. 
Successful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. 
Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique. Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management. If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision. The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma. 
Radionuclide esophageal transit study in detection of esophageal motor dysfunction: comparison with motility studies (manometry) Radionuclide esophageal transit study (RETS) has been developed to assess motor function of the esophagus. The purpose of this study was to compare RETS to esophageal motility studies (EMS) in detection of motility disorders. A total of 109 consecutive patients without previous history of surgery on the esophagus underwent both RETS and EMS within one month of each other. Final diagnosis was divided into three categories: I--primary esophageal motor disorders (n = 39); II--reflux disease (n = 48); and III--non-cardiac chest pain and/or dysphagia (n = 22). Using EMS as the standard, the results of RETS were as follows: sensitivity for detection of motor dysfunction was 97%, 92%, and 77% for Groups I, II, and III, respectively, while specificity was 91% for Group II and 100% for Group III. Global sensitivity was 92% and specificity was 88%. No clinically significant motor disorders were missed by RETS. In conclusion, RETS is a useful noninvasive test for the screening of patients with symptoms thought to be of esophageal origin. 
Staging carcinoma: its value in cancer of the larynx. Three thousand four hundred and forty-five cases of cancer of the larynx were examined and 3,235 assigned to their TNM group. While good correlation with prognosis could be seen, the value of the detailed subsite (as opposed to the main laryngeal regions) was limited to defining T1a and T1b and aiding that of T2. T status gives some indication of prognosis, but the N status is of almost overriding importance. 
Bovine internal thoracic artery graft. Successful use at urgent coronary bypass surgery. Bovine internal thoracic artery grafts (Bioflow) were successfully utilized in two patients for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). One patient was an 80-year-old man with severe varicose veins and a calcified ascending aorta. Heart failure occurred after triple CABG with bilateral internal thoracic and gastroepiploic arteries. The addition of a Bioflow graft to the circumflex artery restored good cardiac function. The second case was a 54-year-old man whose patent old saphenous vein graft was accidentally injured at reoperation. Emergency use of the Bioflow to bypass the right coronary artery in combination with the right gastroepiploic artery graft to the anterior descending artery resulted in an excellent outcome. The two Bioflow grafts were patent at the 20th and 10th postoperative days, respectively. These cases strongly suggest the efficacy of Bioflow during emergency situations in CABG. 
Hepatitis B and C viruses and their interaction in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum taken from patients in a case-control study in Athens, Greece, was used to examine the interactive roles of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC. 
Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp. A case report with complete spontaneous regression. A wide, hemorrhagic lesion occurred on the face and scalp of a 75-year-old woman who had no history of previous trauma to the region. Histology showed features consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Clinical and radiologic investigations failed to show any sign of internal involvement. The lesion completely regressed without any therapy within a few months from onset, and the patient is alive and free of disease 36 months after the first observation. Repeated clinicoradiologic investigations failed again to prove visceral diffusion of the tumor. Spontaneous regression of an angiosarcoma is an exceptional event, and only one similar case has been reported in the literature. 
Mast cells are critical for the production of leukotrienes responsible for neutrophil recruitment in immune complex-induced peritonitis in mice. Mast cells are secretory cells strategically located in the vicinity of blood vessels where they can readily initiate and modulate various inflammatory processes, including plasma exudation and leukocyte infiltration. We have previously shown that 50% of the neutrophil influx during immune complex peritonitis in mice is due to mast cells. Eicosanoids are important mediators of various inflammatory processes including neutrophil infiltration. The possibility that mast cells are essential for the production of leukotrienes (LT) involved in the elicitation of neutrophils in immune complex peritonitis was investigated in mast cell-deficient, WBB6F1-W/WV, and normal, WBB6F(1-)+/+, mice. The time course and amounts of immunoreactive PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and TX3B2 released into the peritoneal exudates were similar in both sets of mice. LTB4 and LTC4 levels, however, were twofold higher in +/+ than in W/WV mice 2 h after stimulation. HPLC analysis of the peritoneal exudate confirmed the presence of leukotrienes. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 blocked leukotriene production in a dose-dependent manner in both sets of mice. However, this compound caused a significant reduction (60%) of neutrophil infiltration only in WBB6F(1-)+/+ but not in the mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/WV mice restored the effect of A-63162 on PMN recruitment. These data suggest that mast cells in the vicinity of blood vessels are important for the synthesis of leukotrienes responsible for PMN recruitment. 
Preliminary experience with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with third-trimester bleeding. Fifteen patients with third-trimester bleeding, in whom transabdominal ultrasound had failed to identify a definitive source of bleeding, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified three cases of placenta previa. In four patients, intrauterine blood was identified in hematomas. One hematoma was associated with a previa, two progressed to acute abruptions, and one was associated with a clot at the marginal cord insertion. Blood was seen leading away from the placenta in a case that progressed to an acute abruption. It was also seen in the region of the cervix in two patients with placenta previa. One patient had a normal MRI but had a fresh clot at delivery, which presumably formed after the imaging. In the remaining seven patients, MRI scans were negative and the placentas were normal at delivery. Our preliminary results suggest that MRI is helpful in evaluating patients with unexplained third-trimester bleeding. 
Development of systemic lupus erythematosus after interferon therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. A 19-year-old man with Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy for 45 months had systemic lupus erythematosus disease features: malar rash, migratory arthralgias, elevated antinuclear antibodies, elevated antinative DNA, hypocomplementemia, lymphopenia, and proteinuria. After discontinuation of the IFN and initiation of corticosteroids, there was gradual recovery of symptoms, a decline in antinative DNA and antinuclear antibodies to normal levels, and a decrease in proteinuria. The potential association between IFN therapy and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the role of IFN in other autoimmune diseases, is discussed. 
Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. 
Angioplasty of an oversized venous bypass graft using two fixed wire systems. Oversized saphenous vein bypass grafts may be inadequately dilated using currently available coronary angioplasty catheters. The hugging balloon technique has been previously described for lesions in large saphenous vein grafts. We report the initial use of the hugging balloon technique using two fixed wire angioplasty catheters in an oversized saphenous vein graft. 
Pituitary gonadal functioning in male alcoholics in an Indian psychiatric hospital. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and hepatic functions were measured in 38 male alcoholics and in 24 male control subjects. Significant elevation of serum LH and a trend of low serum testosterone were noted with scant evidence of advanced liver disease. None of the alcoholics had clinical stigmata of hypogonadism and feminization. 
Renal atrophy or infarction in children with neuroblastoma. Twelve children with adrenal or upper abdominal paraaortic neuroblastoma developed unilateral or bilateral renal atrophy or infarction. At presentation, the children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 9.7 years. Neuroblastomas were stage II (n = 1), III (n = 2), IV-S (n = 2), and IV (n = 7). Treatment varied but included surgery, chemotherapy, localized abdominal irradiation, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Six children developed ipsilateral renal atrophy, five experienced ipsilateral or bilateral acute perioperative renal infarction, and one developed contralateral renal infarction unrelated to surgery. During treatment, two patients required hemodialysis; both subsequently died. Creatinine concentrations in eight patients have been in the normal range. Two patients have had mildly but persistently elevated creatinine levels. Renal damage from primary effects of the tumor can develop in children with adrenal or upper abdominal neuroblastoma. Treatment, especially surgical resection of the primary tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can compound such damage. 
Insular carcinoma: a distinct thyroid carcinoma with associated iodine-131 localization Insular carcinoma, once considered a poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer, has been reclassified as a distinct thyroid neoplasm. Since this neoplasm is composed of follicular epithelial cells, it may concentrate radioiodide (131I) making postoperative 131I imaging for detection of metastases and radiotherapy possible. A 20-yr review of 35 cases diagnosed as anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma at this medical center revealed five patients with insular carcinoma. Four patients showed postoperative 131I localization and received therapeutic doses of 131I. Three of the four showed extrathyroidal 131I localization in neoplastic lesions. In one patient, the resolution of metastatic lesions by magnetic resonance and 131I imaging suggests that 131I may have an important therapeutic role in this aggressive neoplasm. 
Transmural distribution of myocardial edema by NMR relaxometry following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. To determine the distribution and extent of myocardial edema resulting from ischemia and reperfusion, seven open-chest dogs underwent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 2 hours (group I), and 10 underwent occlusion for 2 hours and reperfusion for 2 hours (group II). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema. There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01). These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001). Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups. Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium. Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion. We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion. 
Role of endothelium-derived prostanoid in angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction. To test the hypothesis that prostanoids contribute to angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction, we compared the effect of angiotensin II on isometric tension development by rings of descending thoracic aorta bathed in Krebs' bicarbonate buffer with and without indomethacin (10 microM) to inhibit cyclooxygenase, CGS13080 (10 microM) to inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis, or SQ29548 (1 microM) to block thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors. The comparisons were made in rings of aorta taken from normotensive rats and from rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 12 days and 90-113 days after coarctation. These rings released thromboxane B2, which was found to be endothelium dependent, increased in hypertensive rats, and stimulated by angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in normotensive rats and in hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. The angiotensin II (10(-6) to 10(-5)M)-induced contraction of aortic rings was increased by about 30% at 12 days after coarctation and decreased at 90-113 days after coarctation. Removal of the endothelium increased the contractile effect of angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in aortic rings of normotensive rats and hypertensive rats at 90-113 days after coarctation but decreased the effect in aortic rings of hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. In rats at 12 days after coarctation, the angiotensin II (10(-6) M)-induced contraction of aortic rings with endothelium was attenuated by indomethacin and SQ29548 but not by CGS13080. These data suggest that a prostanoid-mediated and endothelium-dependent mechanism of vasoconstriction contributes to the constrictor effect of angiotensin II in aortic rings of rats in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension. 
Temporary closure of the abdominal wall by use of silicone rubber sheets after operative repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Management of patients after operative repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be further complicated if primary closure of the abdominal wall cannot be technically accomplished or is associated with profound increases in intraabdominal and peak inspiratory pressures. We recently treated five patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and one patient with a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm whose abdominal incisions had to be closed with a Dacron reinforced, silicone sheet. All patients were hemodynamically unstable either at admission to the hospital or became so during operation. Four patients required the insertion of a silicone rubber sheet at the primary operation because of massive retroperitoneal hematoma or edema of the bowel wall or both. Incisions in two patients were closed primarily, but the patients required reexploration and secondary closure with silicone rubber sheets because of the development of marked increases in peak inspiratory pressures, intraabdominal pressures, and decreased urinary output. Four of the six patients subsequently underwent successful removal of the silicone rubber sheets with delayed primary closure of the abdominal wall, and two others died before removal. The patient with the ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm died on postoperative day 20 because of pulmonary sepsis but had a healed abdominal incision. The three surviving patients have been discharged. A silicone rubber sheet may be necessary for closure of the abdominal wall after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients where primary abdominal wall closure is impossible or where it results in compromise in respiratory or renal function. 
Immunohistochemical study of thyroid peroxidase in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic human thyroid tissues. An immunohistochemical study using two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 30 and MoAb 47) against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was performed on surgical specimens of human thyroid carcinoma (n = 65), adenoma (n = 70) and Graves' disease (n = 10). Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control. Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma. Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type. Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type. These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO. Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors. 
Body surface isopotential mapping of the entire QRST complex in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Correlation with the location of the accessory pathway. Body surface potential maps were recorded during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing at the time of electrophysiologic studies in 42 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The locations of the accessory pathways were determined by epicardial mapping during surgery in 34 patients and by multicatheter endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in eight additional patients. During delta wave inscription, the shape and extension of areas of the negative and positive potentials on the thorax correlated better with the preexcitation site (69% of patients) than with the localization of the minimum potential alone (45.2% of patients). Typical potential distributions were present from the beginning of the delta wave and remained stationary during the first half of the QRS complex. During marked preexcitation, the superposition of atrial activity on the delta wave produced a mixed pattern in the earliest maps. However, these alterations of early delta thoracic potential distribution did not persist longer than 30 msec. The spread of the negative potentials during the last half of the QRS complex also characterized each localization: right-sided preexcitation reproduced the depolarization sequence of left bundle branch block, left-sided preexcitation reproduced that of right bundle branch block, and posterior pathways resembled left anterior fascicular block. Anterior left ventricular and more anterior left lateral ventricular preexcitations mimicked a right bundle branch block-left posterior fascicular block pattern. There was good correlation between the body surface potential map obtained during the ST segment and the site of the right-sided preexcitation. However, in left-sided preexcitations, ST patterns concordant with delta wave patterns were found less frequently than in right-sided preexcitations. 
Amantadine toxicity presenting with complex ventricular ectopy and hallucinations. Amantadine hydrochloride is a commonly prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic range. Toxicity is related to the anticholinergic properties of the drug and primarily affects the cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems. We report the case of an adolescent who ingested 1.3 grams of amantadine and developed complex ventricular arrhythmias and altered mental status. The arrhythmias were completely suppressed with intravenous lidocaine. This case supports the hypothesis that lidocaine is effective for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias secondary to amantadine toxicity. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. Predominant finding of aggressive duodenal ulcer disease. We reviewed our experience with endoscopically evaluated severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following open heart surgery. Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases. No significant complications of endoscopy were observed. Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%). Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases. Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs. We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. 
Nonketotic hyperglycinemia: treatment with NMDA antagonist and consideration of neuropathogenesis. Patients with neonatal-onset nonketotic hyperglycinemia have high-glycine content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is believed to be a cause of intractable neurologic manifestations. The glycine receptor was believed to be inhibitory in the central nervous system; however, a newly discovered glycine receptor is of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor type, which cannot be antagonized by strychnine. The NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, was administered to a patient with nonketotic hyperglycinemia; he demonstrated some improvement in hyperirritability, voluntary movement, and electroencephalographic findings. Strychnine therapy had been administered before this trial of NMDA antagonist, but without improvement. The respiratory condition improved with the reduction of the CSF glycine level after withdrawal of sodium valproate. Our findings indicate that high-glycine content in CSF may affect the brain in different ways via NMDA and classic glycine receptors. 
Survival and valve failure after aortic valve replacement. A prospective evaluation of 412 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1985 was performed in an attempt to identify the determinants of survival and valve failure. A variety of valves were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves including: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 37), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 261), Hancock pericardial (n = 78), and Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 36). Thirteen patients died in the hospital (3.2%) and 47 patients died in the follow-up period producing an actuarial survival of 81% +/- 3% at 48 months. Survival was independently predicted by advancing age, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and the presence of endocarditis (p less than 0.05 by Cox regression analysis). The majority of patients were symptomatically improved (New York Heart Association class I or II: 21% preoperative, 88% postoperative). Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and reoperation for valve-related complications were 95% +/- 2%, 95% +/- 2%, and 92% +/- 2% at 48 months, respectively. These valve-related complications occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those with a Hancock pericardial valve (freedom from structural valve dysfunction, 89% +/- 5%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 84% +/- 9%; reoperation, 78% +/- 10%; p less than 0.05 by Cox regression). Freedom from thromboembolism was 88% +/- 2% at 48 months; it was significantly lower in patients with a preoperative thromboembolic event and was not influenced by the type of prosthesis inserted. Freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 85% +/- 8% at 48 months and was not influenced by any preoperative factors. 
Iliopectineal bursitis: an unusual cause of iliofemoral vein compression. The iliopectineal bursa is the largest bursa in the region of the hip joint. Enlargement of the bursa occurs in several conditions and may be manifested by groin pain, a pelvic or inguinal mass, or lower extremity edema due to compression of the external iliac or common femoral vein. A case of lower extremity edema secondary to external iliac/common femoral vein compression caused by an enlarged iliopectineal bursa is presented. The pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis, and forms of therapy are discussed. 
Efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the management of intermittent claudication. Treating chronic arterial occlusive disease with heparin is controversial because of the risks associated with long-term anticoagulant therapy. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (mw about 5000 Dalton), which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage, seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism. Therefore, 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose (15,000 UaXa) of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time. After six months, LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity (by lengthening the pain-free walking time by 25%) but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern (by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates). LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the anti-Xa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time (+20%). No LMW heparin-treated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects. These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs. 
Coarctation: do we need to resect ductal tissue? A review of the literature as well as a retrospective review of 100 neonates undergoing operation for coarctation at Children's Hospital in Boston between 1972 and 1984 has not established clear superiority for either resection and end-to-end anastomosis or subclavian flap aortoplasty with respect to risk of recurrent coarctation. However, there is histological evidence that the juxtaductal coarctation shelf is composed of smooth muscle of ductal origin, which subsequently fibroses. This abnormal tissue may be at risk for late aneurysm development, particularly if balloon dilatation angioplasty is required. The fact that this abnormal tissue is not removed by the subclavian flap procedure is one of the inherent disadvantages of that procedure. Other disadvantages include the need to sacrifice the left subclavian artery and the fact that, unlike resection and end-to-end anastomosis, the subclavian flap procedure does not lend itself to augmentation of the hypoplastic distal aortic arch. Furthermore, occasionally a secondary coarctation membrane is present within the distal aortic arch, and though it is readily detected during the resection procedure, it can be missed with the subclavian flap procedure. Based on these considerations rather than on a demonstrated superiority of either procedure, my colleagues and I currently prefer resection and end-to-end anastomosis over subclavian flap aortoplasty. 
Differences of pathophysiology in experimental meningitis caused by three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Differences in cytochemical and pathophysiologic abnormalities in experimental meningitis caused by pneumococcal strains A, B, and C were determined. Strain C produced the most severe abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of lactate (P less than .01), protein (P less than .02), and glucose (P less than .01), CSF white blood cell count (P less than .04), cerebral blood flow (P less than .02), and clinical signs (P less than .05). Brain edema occurred only with strains A anc C, with no association with disease severity; intracranial hypertension was also independent of disease severity. Strain B, not C, achieved the highest bacterial titers in the CSF (P less than .005). The widely different abilities of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae to induce intracranial abnormalities suggest that virulence determinants affect not only evasion of defense during colonization and invasion, as shown in other models, but also determine the course of disease once infection has been established. Differences of cell-wall metabolism among pneumococcal strains may play a role in this latter phase of the development of meningitis. 
Lack of correlation between histologic findings and response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. A retrospective analysis was undertaken to assess the prognostic role of histologic findings in response to chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Histologic material was available for 395 of 1587 patients treated for metastatic breast cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1973 and 1984. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide or similar drugs, with or without tamoxifen. Maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil was continued for 2 years after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2 was administered. The histologic distribution was as follows: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 353; invasive lobular, 14; mixed histology, ten; mucinous, seven; signet ring, four; tubular, three; papillary, two; sarcomatoid, one; and apocrine, one. Because individual histologic types occurred infrequently, the patients were divided into infiltrating ductal and nonductal groups. Baseline patient characteristics included age, performance status, estrogen-receptor status, prior hormone response, disease extent, and levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase. These were similar in the two groups. Significantly more patients with nonductal histology had greater than three metastatic sites. There were also more patients with hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl and albumin less than 3.5 mg/dl in the nonductal group of patients. However, statistically these factors did not have an impact on the results. There was a 63% response rate (17% complete and 46% partial) for the ductal group and a 60% response rate (12% complete and 48% partial) for the nonductal group. The time from initiation of chemotherapy to disease progression was identical (12 months) for the two groups. Survival from initiation of chemotherapy was not significantly different (22 months for ductal and 27 months for nonductal). Based on this study, the authors conclude that histologic findings have no bearing on patient response to chemotherapy or survival in metastatic breast cancer. 
Thromboembolism prophylaxis. Choosing the proper method for surgical patients. The primary care physician can play a major role in preoperative consultation in terms of assisting the surgical team to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. A preoperative risk assessment takes into account the type and duration of surgery as well as the existence of risk factors such as age and underlying medical conditions. With careful communication, the consulting physician and surgical team can together select a method of preventing thromboembolism that will prove both safe and effective. 
Prenatal alcohol exposure and language development. The effects of fetal alcohol exposure on language and speech acquisition were investigated in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children. Language development was assessed by instruments derived from the Expressive and Receptive Scales of the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) at 1, 2, and 3 years, and by indices constructed from a taped speech sample at age 2 years. Three indices of maternal drinking were supplemented with birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. No statistically significant relationships were found between the alcohol and language indices after statistical control for confounding variables. The anomalies tally was marginally related to reduced language scores. The statistical significance of this relationship, depended, however, on a single child with the characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome. The pattern of results suggested that the anomalies tally, and to a lesser extent birth weight, are more sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol exposure than subsequent language development. 
Acute and chronic poisoning from residential exposures to elemental mercury--Michigan, 1989-1990. From May 1989 through November 1990, eight episodes of elemental mercury exposure in private residences or schools in the United States were reported to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The case studies in this report document two of these episodes (both in Michigan) of residential mercury poisoning--one involving acute mercury exposure, and the other, chronic exposure to elemental mercury. These episodes illustrate the differing clinical and toxicologic manifestations of acute and chronic mercury poisoning. 
Recognition of UGA as a selenocysteine codon in type I deiodinase requires sequences in the 3' untranslated region. Selenocysteine is incorporated cotranslationally at UGA codons, normally read as stop codons, in several bacterial proteins and in the mammalian proteins glutathione peroxidase (GPX), selenoprotein P and Type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase (5'DI). Previous analyses in bacteria have suggested that a stem-loop structure involving the UGA codon and adjacent sequences is necessary and sufficient for selenocysteine incorporation into formate dehydrogenase and glycine reductase. We used the recently cloned 5'DI to investigate selenoprotein synthesis in eukaryotes. We show that successful incorporation of selenocysteine into this enzyme requires a specific 3' untranslated (3'ut) segment of about 200 nucleotides, which is found in both rat and human 5'DI messenger RNAs. These sequences are not required for expression of a cysteine-mutant deiodinase. Although there is little primary sequence similarity between the 3'ut regions of these mRNAs and those encoding GPX, the 3'ut sequences of rat GPX can substitute for the 5'DI sequences in directing selenocysteine insertion. Computer analyses predict similar stem-loop structures in the 3'ut regions of the 5'DI and GPX mRNAs. Limited mutations in these structures reduce or eliminate their capacity to permit 5'DI translation. These results identify a 'selenocysteine-insertion sequence' motif in the 3'ut region of these mRNAs that is essential for successful translation of 5'DI, presumably GPX, and possibly other eukaryotic selenocysteine-containing proteins. 
Epilepsy surgery in the posterior cortex. Fourteen (74%) of 19 patients obtained a significant reduction in seizures after posterior corticectomy; 6 (32%) were seizure-free over a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 1 to 14 years). Surgery included limited resections of the occipital lobe in 16 patients, posterior temporal region in 11, and posterior portion of parietal lobe in 7. Surgical failure related to probable multiple areas of epileptogenesis (4 patients), or limited resections (2 patients) to preserve visual fields (2 patients) and to avoid dyslexia (1 patient). Of 14 patients without a complete hemianopia preoperatively, 6 (43%) developed a new or increased visual field deficit, 2 (14%) of which were hemianopia. Four (36%) of 11 occipital lobe resections resulted in a new or increased visual field deficit: quadrantanopia in 3 and hemianopia in 1. Visual phenomena were the most common initial ictal symptoms, occurring in 13 (68%) of the 19 patients. Twelve patients had complex partial seizures: in 2, always without warning; in 7, always following an aura, usually visual; and in 3 patients, with or without warning. Scalp electroencephalography identified the origin of most recorded seizures in 12 (63%) of the 19 patients. A principal interictal spike focus appeared in 15 patients (79%), and always correlated with the epileptogenic lobe as defined by scalp and/or subdural-recorded seizures (14 patients) or by clinical analysis and computed tomography (1 patient). 
Mitochondrial DNA and Parkinson's disease. Two major lines of evidence support the hypothesis that an impairment of mitochondrial function may underlie neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. First, the neurotoxicity of the parkinsonism-inducing compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is due to the generation of its 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) metabolite in the central nervous system; the toxicity of MPP+ is likely to result from its ability to block mitochondrial electron flow at the level of complex I. Second, recent studies have revealed a deficiency of mitochondrial complex I activity in the brain as well as other tissues of parkinsonian patients. This enzyme activity reduction might be explained by a defect in one or more of the genes coding for the subunits of complex I. Since seven of these genes are localized in the mitochondrial genome, it is conceivable that abnormal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The entire sequence of the human mitochondrial genome is known, and human mtDNA can be isolated and rapidly analyzed using techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, identification of an easily detectable mtDNA alteration might ultimately be used as a marker for the diagnosis and screening of Parkinson's disease. 
Prevention of arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis with recombinant lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor BACKGROUND. This study was designed to determine whether arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented by lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI), a physiological inhibitor of tissue factor-induced coagulation mediated by the extrinsic pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thrombosis was induced in femoral arteries of anesthetized dogs with the use of anodal current to elicit extensive vascular injury and formation of platelet-rich thrombi in one artery and with thrombogenic copper wire to elicit fibrin-rich thrombi without appreciable vascular injury in the contralateral artery. Recanalization of both vessels was induced with t-PA (1.7 mg/kg i.v. over 1 hour) and verified with Doppler flow probes. Reocclusion occurred within 2 hours in seven of seven arteries with electrical injury-induced thrombosis and in four of seven arteries with copper wire-induced thrombosis in the absence of LACI. In dogs given infusions of recombinant DNA-produced LACI (225 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, followed by 4 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) after completion of the infusion of t-PA, no reocclusion occurred during the 2-hour interval of observation in any of the five arteries subjected to electrical injury (p less than 0.001), and cyclic partial occlusions were nearly abolished (0.4 +/- 0.4/hr in LACI-treated dogs compared with 13.7 +/- 5.5/hr in saline-treated dogs, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, reocclusion occurred in two of five arteries with indwelling copper wires, and cyclic partial occlusions were unaffected despite LACI. LACI prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.7 +/- 0.2 x baseline) but did not affect platelet counts or aggregation assessed ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation with LACI prevents thrombotic arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis in vessels subjected to extensive vascular injury. Our results demonstrate that activation of the extrinsic pathway plays a critical role in thrombotic reocclusion and that LACI provides a highly targeted approach to facilitate sustained recanalization without directly inhibiting platelets. 
Common reactions to transfusions. A blood transfusion is a special kind of transplantation, with the transfer of living tissue from one person to another. Reactions can occur with as little as 10 to 15 ml of incompatible blood. The onset of a reaction may be misleading or delayed, and its detection requires astute assessment. Responsibility for recognition of a transfusion reaction lies with the transfusionist, who is often a nurse. The following types of response can occur: hemolytic reactions, transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease, hemoglobinuria, purpura, fever, circulatory overload, thrombophlebitis, urticaria, hyperkalemia, asymptomatic hemoglobinuria, pulmonary edema, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Critical care nurses need to be aware of the dangers of blood and blood product transfusions and to be prepared to react quickly. 
Lipid cyst: classic and atypical appearances. Lipid cysts, a specific type of fat necrosis, frequently have a pathognomonic appearance on radiographs. This consists of a lucent lesion surrounded by a smooth rim that may or not be calcified. Occasionally, lipid cysts with unusual mammographic appearances are encountered. An appreciation of some of these appearances may prevent unnecessary biopsies. 
Motor neuron disease in a patient with a monoclonal IgMk directed against GM1, GD1b, and high-molecular-weight neural-specific glycoproteins. In a patient with motor neuron disease and benign IgMk monoclonal gammopathy, the M protein reacted with the glycolipids GM1, GD1b, and asialo GM1 and, by immunoblot, with some high-molecular-weight neural-specific glycoproteins. The main reactive bands had an approximate molecular weight of 250 and 400 kd, were most concentrated in the spinal cord, and were also bound by the lectin peanut agglutinin. The presence of the Ga1(beta 1-3)Ga1NAc epitope on these neural-specific glycoproteins may help to explain the selective neurological impairment of the patient. 
Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure, and mucosal acid sensitivity are three separate, though related, aspects of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The Bernstein test has been used as a test of oesophageal acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50% temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive acid perfusion test (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100% sensitivity, 73% specificity, and 81% accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux. All 10 patients with symptomatic reflux during pH monitoring had evidence of mucosal acid sensitivity. A negative acid perfusion test made symptomatic reflux unlikely. However, symptomatic reflux or a positive acid perfusion test, or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease. The Bernstein test is simple, safe, and easily performed. A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring. 
Relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and urinary kallikrein excretion in essential hypertensives. In order to seek possible relationships between renal kallikrein and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), we measured urinary kallikrein (UK) and ANF in 84 normal subjects (NS) and in 104 uncomplicated essential hypertensives (HP). Atrial natriuretic factor was significantly higher in HP than in NS (38.5 +/- 1.3 vs 29.0 +/- 1.3 pg/mL, P less than .01), whereas UK was significantly lower in HP than in NS (11.1 +/- 0.9 v 15.3 +/- 0.6 nkatal/24 h, P less than .01). Calculating the 95% of the percentile distribution of the single values of UK in the group of NS we were able to show that 24 out of 104 HP had a UK which fell below the lowest limit (4.5 nkat/24 h) of the normal range. We therefore divided our HP into two subgroups: patients with normal kallikrein excretion (NK) (n = 80; mean UK 13.8 +/- 0.8 nkat/24 h) and patients with low kallikrein excretion (LK) (n = 24; mean UK 2.3 +/- 0.3 nkat/24 h). Normal kallikrein patients had a mean plasma ANF value of 31.9 +/- 1.2 pg/mL which was almost superimposable to that found in NS; on the contrary, the mean plasma level of ANF in LK patients (50.7 +/- 2.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that measured in NK patients and in NS (P less than .01 v NK patients and NS, respectively). Since a low urinary kallikrein excretion may represent a marker of an impaired production of renal kallikrein, the high levels of ANF found in the LK subgroup could be the result of a compensatory response of the atrium attempting to maintain sodium and volume homeostasis. 
Norepinephrine response to exercise of rats with a chronic myocardial infarction. Plasma and tissue norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were determined at rest and after 45 min of swimming in rats with a surgically induced myocardial infarction (MI) and in rats having undergone a sham operation (SHAM). The MI rats had moderate-sized infarcts and demonstrated decreases in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that are consistent with the contention that the animals possessed a significant amount of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and chronic heart failure (CHF). Plasma NE concentrations measured at rest were not significantly different between the SHAM and MI groups of rats, although a strong trend was found for the plasma NE concentrations to be elevated in the MI group. The plasma NE responses to 45 min of swimming at the same absolute submaximal workload were similar in the two groups of rats in light of the fact that the MI group of rats exercised at a greater percentage of their VO2max when compared with their SHAM counterparts. Exercise produced significant reductions in the NE concentrations of the diaphragm, vastus lateralis, red portion of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and vastus intermedius muscles for both the SHAM and MI groups of rats. In addition, the NE concentrations measured in both the soleus and red portion of the gastrocnemius muscle were significantly greater in the MI rats when compared with their SHAM counterparts for both rest and exercise conditions. The results from the present study support the hypothesis that the sympathetic response to exercise is either unchanged or attenuated in MI rats that have a significant amount of LV dysfunction and CHF. 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Evidence that genetic emphysema in tight-skin mice is not caused by neutrophil elastase. Mutant tight-skin mice that had severe pulmonary emphysema were crossed with beige mice that contained neutrophils deficient in elastase activity. The resultant tight skin-beige cross mice were deficient in neutrophil elastase activity, yet they were still afflicted with the same degree of severe emphysema as the tight-skin mice. The results indicate that neutrophil elastase does not cause the emphysematous lesions found in tight-skin mice. 
Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in right hepatectomy with the preoperative APACHE II score. Morbidity and mortality rates in 70 patients who underwent major liver resection for liver tumors (primary and metastatic) were determined and correlated with the preoperative APACHE II score. Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative APACHE II score: low (0 to 3), mid (4 to 7), and high (8 and above). A higher score was closely correlated with increased postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates. The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%. Age did not correlate with morbidity. It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age. As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group). Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points. The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery. 
The feeding pharyngostomy: an alternative approach to enteral feeding. We present a six-year retrospective review of feeding pharyngostomies as performed in this department. The indications, technique and complications of this procedure are discussed. 
Randomized, controlled trial comparing long-term sulfonamide therapy to ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion. Several studies have indicated that either the surgical insertion of ventilation tubes (VTs) or long-term treatment with sulfonamide-based antibacterials is effective in the management of otitis media with effusion (OME; otherwise known as serous otitis media, secretory otitis media, and glue ear) when compared with a no-treatment control or placebo. This controlled trial is the first to compare directly the effectiveness of these two treatments for long-standing OME. Outcome variables are treatment success rates, hearing thresholds, recurrent acute otitis media episodes, and side effects of medication or complications of VT placement. One hundred twenty-five children (aged 2.5 to 7 years) who met the usual indications for surgery (long-standing [greater than 3 months] OME and conductive hearing loss) were randomly assigned to "medical" treatment (sulfisoxazole 75 mg/kg per day for 6 months) or "surgical" treatment (bilateral insertion of VTs). Subjects underwent pure-tone audiometry (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) and otomicroscopic examination at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. A significantly greater proportion of medical subjects (67%) than surgical subjects (48%) were treatment failures at 6, 12, or 18 months (P = .0208). Surgical subjects had significantly better hearing at 2 and 4 months (P values less than .01) but not at 6, 12, and 18 months (P values greater than .2). A significantly greater proportion of surgical subjects (50%) experienced complications of treatment than did medical subjects (9%) (P less than .001). Thirty-three percent of candidates for VT placement did not require surgery when treated with a 6-month course of sulfisoxazole. 
Randomised study of antiepileptic drug withdrawal in patients in remission. Medical Research Council Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal Study Group A prospective multicentre randomised study of continued antiepileptic treatment vs slow withdrawal was conducted in 1013 patients who had been free of seizures for at least 2 years. Comparison of randomised and eligible, but non-randomised, patients suggests the results should be applicable to a wider patient population. By 2 years after randomisation, 78% of patients in whom treatment was continued and 59% of those in whom it was withdrawn remained seizure free, but thereafter the differences between the two groups diminished. Non-compliance with continued treatment accounted for only a small proportion of the risk to the group continuing with treatment. The most important factors determining outcome were longer seizure-free periods (reducing the risk) and more than one antiepileptic drug and a history of tonic-clonic seizures (increasing the risk). Other factors (eg, history of neonatal seizures, specific electroencephalographic features) seemed to have smaller effects, but even in such a large study the confidence intervals for these observations were wide. 
Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. 
Clinical relevance of tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene amplification in childhood neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. We assessed tumor cell DNA content (ploidy) and N-myc gene copy number as predictors of long-term disease-free survival in 298 children with neuroblastoma. Diploid tumor stem lines were identified in 101 patients (34%), clonal hyperdiploid abnormalities in 194 (65%), and hypodiploid stem lines in three (1%). In children with widely disseminated tumors at diagnosis (stage D), ploidy had a highly age-dependent influence on prognosis. Among infants (less than 12 months) treated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, hyperdiploidy was closely associated with long-term disease-free survival (greater than 90% of cases), while diploidy invariably predicted early treatment failure (P less than .001). Similarly, in children 12 to 24 months of age who were treated with cisplatin-teniposide and cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin, diploidy uniformly predicted early failure, whereas half of the children with hyperdiploidy achieved long-term disease-free survival (P less than .001). There was no relationship between ploidy and treatment outcome in children older than 24 months with stage D tumors who had a very low probability of long-term disease-free survival (less than 10%). N-myc gene amplification was detected in 37 (25%) of the 147 tumors tested, with the remainder showing single-copy levels of the gene. N-myc gene amplification was more frequent in diploid than in hyperdiploid tumors (23 of 57 v 14 of 87, P = .001) and predicted a high likelihood of early treatment failure. In children younger than 2 years with disseminated neuroblastoma, tumor cell ploidy and N-myc gene copy number provide complementary prognostic information that will distinguish patients who can be cured on current regimens from those who require new treatment strategies. 
Spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection shown by magnetic resonance imaging. We have reported a case of spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery, with MRI and angiographic findings. We conclude that MRI is a beneficial noninvasive test for the detection and study of carotid artery dissection. 
Protein C activation following coronary artery occlusion in the in situ porcine heart BACKGROUND. Activated protein C, the body's natural anticoagulant, may play a role in protecting the heart during and following an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in the porcine heart. METHODS AND RESULTS. Infusion of 1 unit thrombin over 30 seconds into the LAD of juvenile pigs produced a prolongation of the Xa clotting time (153 +/- 14%) in blood drawn from the anterior interventricular vein (AIV). The action of the anticoagulant was blocked by a polyclonal immunoglobulin G antibody directed against porcine activated protein C. A brief (30 seconds) occlusion of the LAD induced a similar prolongation of the Xa clotting time (138 +/- 11%), which was also blocked by the polyclonal antibody. To determine whether activated protein C helps sustain the heart during and following a 2-minute occlusion, three groups of pigs were studied: 11 controls, six receiving activated porcine protein C, and nine receiving a monoclonal antibody (HPC4) that blocks protein C activation. Relative to the controls, HPC4-treated animals recovered function, as measured by the maximum time derivative of left ventricular pressure and segmental shortening, more slowly and were not able to sustain this recovery. Animals receiving activated protein C recovered more quickly and sustained this recovery. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that an ischemic insult induces rapid activation of protein C in the coronary microcirulation and that blocking this activation impairs recovery. 
Irregular coronary lesion morphology after thrombolysis predicts early clinical instability After successful thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia and infarction may occur with little warning. Coronary lesion morphology was analyzed from angiograms performed in 72 consecutive patients at 1 to 8 days after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction and the data were evaluated in relation to the subsequent clinical course. All patients were clinically stable at the time of angiography and continued to receive heparin infusion for greater than or equal to 4 days after thrombolysis. The infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). In the 10 days after angiography, 15 patients developed prolonged episodes of angina at rest; the condition of 4 stabilized with medical treatment, but 11 required urgent medical intervention (coronary angioplasty in 8 and bypass surgery in 3). There were no differences in age, gender, left ventricular function or extent of coronary artery disease between those patients who developed unstable angina and those who had a stable in-hospital course. However, the median plaque ulceration index of the infarct-related lesion was 6.7 (95% confidence limits 6.3, 10) in the 15 patients with an unstable course versus 3.3 (2, 4.4) in those with a stable course (p less than 0.001). There were no differences between the two patient groups in the severity of stenosis, length of diseased segment, symmetry/eccentricity, presence of a shoulder, location at branch point or bend, presence of globular or linear filling defects, contrast staining or collateral supply. These data show that after thrombolysis, the degree of irregularity of the infarct-related artery is a critical determinant of early clinical instability. 
Predominant T cell receptor V gene usage in patients with abnormal clones of B cells. We have examined alpha/beta V gene segment usage of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, from patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, by using T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). In 7 of 16 patients we found an increase in the usage of various TCR V gene segments. The expansion was confined to either the CD4+ or the CD8+ T-cell subset, except for one patient where an abnormal pattern was observed both within the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets. In one patient 47%, and in another patient 30% of the CD8+ lymphocytes reacted with alpha V12.1 and beta V6.7 antibodies, respectively. In two other patients 29% and 40% of the CD4+ lymphocytes reacted with beta V6.7 and beta V8.1 antibodies, respectively. We conclude that T cells with a predominant V gene usage is a frequent feature in patients with abnormal clonal B cells of malignant or benign types. T- and B-cell populations are normally clonally linked in regulatory circuits. An abnormal proliferation of B cells might therefore induce, or be regulated by, an expansion of clonal T cells, as suggested by the present results. 
The B-cell antigen receptor of the five immunoglobulin classes. Several proteins associate with surface IgM to form the antigen receptor. We show that just two, the alpha and beta associated chains, are sufficient to reconstitute an IgM surface receptor in fibroblasts. Contrary to expectation, a common alpha chain associates with all five immunoglobulin classes. We propose that B-cell antigen receptors consist of a common alpha/beta heterodimer associated with each immunoglobulin class. But the classes differ both in the glycosylation of their associated alpha chain and in their dependence on alpha/beta for surface transport. 
Case of penetrating orbitocranial injury caused by wood. A case of retained intraorbital and intracerebral wooden foreign body following an orbitocranial penetrating injury through the lower lid of an adult is described. Initial failure to recognise the true nature of the injury led to intracerebral abscess formation and monocular blindness. Diagnosis and management of such cases are discussed. 
Ibuprofen provides longer lasting analgesia than fentanyl after laparoscopic surgery. The authors compared the analgesic efficacy of one dose of oral ibuprofen with that of intravenously administered fentanyl for relief of pain after outpatient laparoscopic surgery. Thirty healthy female patients received either 800 mg of oral ibuprofen preoperatively or 75 micrograms of intravenous fentanyl intraoperatively plus respective intravenous or oral placebos in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients recorded their degree of pain and nausea in the recovery room, in the same-day surgery stepdown unit, during the ride home, and upon arrival at home. The postanesthesia care nurse recorded the amount of fentanyl and droperidol needed to treat pain and nausea in the recovery room. Patients who received ibuprofen were more comfortable in the stepdown unit (P less than 0.05) and after arrival home (P less than 0.05) than those in the fentanyl group. Additionally, patients who received ibuprofen had lower nausea scores in the step-down unit (P less than 0.05); this may have been related to the lower total fentanyl dose in these patients. The authors conclude that ibuprofen may be a useful alternative to fentanyl for providing postoperative analgesia for outpatient surgery. 
Renal and extra-renal levels of renin mRNA in experimental hypertension. 1. Using a ribonuclease-protection assay, renin mRNA levels were compared in the kidneys, livers, brains, hearts and adrenal glands of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats with those of age-matched control rats at 4 weeks ('early') and 20 weeks ('chronic') after clipping, and in the kidneys and adrenal glands of rats treated for 3 weeks with deoxycorticosterone and salt (deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension) with those of control rats. 2. While marked changes were observed in kidney renin mRNA levels in all three experimental groups compared with their respective controls, in most of the extra-renal tissue studied minimal, if any, difference was seen in renin mRNA levels between the hypertensive and control rats. 3. The findings suggest that in these extra-renal tissues renin gene expression is differently regulated from that in the kidney, and particularly that it is not profoundly affected by changes in the level of circulating angiotensin II. 4. An increase in renin mRNA was observed in the adrenal glands of the 'chronic' Goldblatt rats, which may be of relevance to the maintenance of hypertension in this model. 
Rearrangements of the tal-1 locus as clonal markers for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Normal and aberrant immune receptor gene assembly each produce site-specific DNA rearrangements in leukemic lymphoblasts. In either case, these rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for the leukemias in question. In the t(1;14)(p34;q11) translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the breakpoints on chromosome 1 interrupt the tal-1 gene. A site-specific deletion interrupts the same gene in an additional 26% of T-ALL. Thus, nearly one-third of these leukemias contain clustered rearrangements of the tal-1 locus. To test whether these rearrangements can serve as markers for residual disease, we monitored four patients with T-ALL; three of the leukemias contained a deleted (tald) and one a translocated (talt) tal-1 allele. These alleles were recognized by a sensitive amplification/hybridization assay. tald alleles were found in the blood of one patient during the 4th mo of treatment but not thereafter. Using a quantitative assay to measure the fraction of tald alleles in DNA extracts, we estimated that this month 4 sample contained 150 tald copies per 10(6) genome copies. The patient with t(1;14)(p34;q11) (talt) leukemia developed a positive assay during the 20th mo of treatment. By standard criteria, all four patients remain in complete remission 11-20 mo into treatment. We conclude that tal-1 rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for approximately 30% of T-ALLs. 
Effect of omeprazole on duodenal ulcer-associated antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori. This study set out to investigate the effects of omeprazole or ranitidine on the progression of antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori in patients with active duodenal ulcer. A double-blind, double-dummy trial was performed in 270 patients, 241 of whom were studied histologically for the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 10 mg every morning, omeprazole, 20 mg every morning, or ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for four weeks. Endoscopy was performed on entry and at weekly intervals during the study; at least two antral biopsies were taken on each occasion to assess the activity and degree of chronic inflammation, as reflected by the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and mononuclear cell infiltration, respectively. Biopsy specimens also were assessed histologically for H. pylori. The sex, age and maximal acid output were comparable in the three treatment groups. The percentages of patients showing an improvement in the activity of gastritis in the four consecutive weeks of treatment were 9%, 40%, 51%, and 53% for omeprazole, 10 mg (N = 78); 14%, 42%, 49%, and 53% for omeprazole, 20 mg (N = 81); and 2%, 23%, 30%, and 33% for ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day (N = 82) (life table analysis gave P less than 0.01 for both omeprazole regimens compared with ranitidine). The degree of chronic inflammation showed similar changes. The density of H. pylori decreased significantly after treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg or 20 mg, (both, P less than 0.00001) but not with ranitidine. 
Cytoprotection and stress ulceration. The stomach possesses many mechanisms for protection against stress ulceration. The gastric microcirculation, prostaglandins, mucus secretion, epithelial cell renewal, and muscle tone are factors involved in gastric cytoprotection. Therapy is partially directed at augmenting these natural physiologic defense mechanisms to prevent and promote healing of stress ulceration. Drugs such as sucralfate, carbenoxalone, colloidal bismuth, and prostaglandins are used. Stress ulceration is an important cause of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage in postoperative and critically ill patients in the intensive care unit setting. Preventive therapy includes neutralization of gastric acid by antacids, suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2-receptor blockers, administration of cytoprotective agents, and correction of the underlying stress state. Active bleeding requires accurate diagnosis by gastroscopy. Additional therapy may be necessary, including intra-arterial administration of vasopressin and occasionally surgery. Dieulafoy's lesion is an unusual stress-related cause for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The area of mucosal injury is minute but underneath lies a large submucosal gastric artery. It can cause massive bleeding and is often missed at initial gastroscopy. The pathogenesis of Dieulafoy's lesion is complex and the mainstay of therapy has been surgical. Ligation of the vessel, wedge resection, or proximal gastric resection is performed. Therapeutic endoscopy with endoscopic cauterization or injection has changed the approach to this lesion. 
Echocardiographic prediction of left ventricular volume after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular volume is a strong determinant of survival after acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine which clinical and echocardiographic criteria assessed early after myocardial infarction would predict later left ventricular dilation. Forty-eight patients with uncomplicated transmural myocardial infarction had echocardiography 5 to 10 days after myocardial infarction and assessment of clinical variables including peak creatine kinase and sum of electrocardiographic ST segment elevation. Left ventricular dimensions were measured from the echocardiogram in the parasternal view and also in the apical four and two chamber views at the level of the mitral leaflets, papillary muscles and apex. A cardiac wall motion score was obtained by segmental analysis of the apical views. Echocardiographic left ventricular volume was measured after 1 year from the apical views with use of a Simpson's rule method. Initial clinical and echocardiographic variables were correlated with the left ventricular volume at 1 year. There was a significant relation between the initial four and two chamber end-diastolic dimensions and the left ventricular volume at 1 year, particularly for dimensions measured at the apical level (four chamber R2 = 0.66, p = 0.0001, two chamber R2 = 0.61, p = 0.0001). Other clinical variables, parasternal left ventricular dimensions and cardiac wall motion score were not significantly related to left ventricular volume. A powerful three variable model obtained by multiple regression and including the initial two chamber apical dimension, cardiac wall motion score and body surface area accounted for 82% of the variation in left ventricular volume at 1 year. 
Upbeat and downbeat nystagmus occurring successively in a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage. In a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage, first upbeat and later downbeat nystagmus occurred in the primary position. The lesion was limited to the posterior and medial part of the medulla. Clinical and electro-oculographic examination first showed upbeat nystagmus in the primary position and upgaze, with downbeat nystagmus in downgaze. Two and a half months later, there was downbeat nystagmus in the primary position and downgaze and upbeat nystagmus in upgaze. 
Hyperinsulinemia or increased sympathetic drive as links for obesity and hypertension. The association of obesity with hypertension has been amply demonstrated in cross-sectional, longitudinal, and dietary-intervention studies, but the mechanisms remain enigmatic. Both conditions are independently characterized by similar metabolic alterations, i.e., glucose intolerance, dyslipoproteinemia, elevated serum uric acid, and inadequate Na+ transport. Obesity, hypertension, and these metabolic alterations are associated with hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. The degree of these alterations is lowest in lean hypertensives, intermediate in obese normotensives, and greatest in obese hypertensives, but mortality risk is highest in lean hypertensives. This apparent discrepancy may be related to the divergent hemodynamic characteristics, possibly indicating different etiology, of lean and obese hypertensives, i.e., contracted blood volume, increased total vascular peripheral resistance, and normal sympathetic drive in the former, expanded blood volume, normal peripheral resistance, and increased sympathetic drive in the latter. Current knowledge suggests that the interrelationships of obesity and hypertension with the metabolic alterations could be mediated by high carbohydrate and fat consumption and low physical activity, resulting in obesity and separate pathways in hyperinsulinemia and increased sympathetic drive, leading to a double vicious cycle. In one, hyperinsulinemia and the consequent insulin resistance would compound one another. In the second, the increasing hyperinsulinemia would increasingly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This double vicious cycle could result in increasing hemodynamic and metabolic derangements causing hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The association of lean hypertension with ASCVD may be through other mechanisms, e.g., hemodynamic forces on the vascular endothelium. 
Can esmolol manage surgically-induced tachycardia? Bolus esmolol treatment of intra-operative tachycardia due to surgical stimulation. A double-blind, randomised study was conducted to examine the efficacy of a single bolus dose of esmolol in treating surgically-induced tachycardia. Anaesthetic technique was identical in all patients, and consisted of premedication with midazolam and glycopyrronium, induction with thiopentone followed by suxamethonium, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with isoflurane 0.6% (end-tidal) and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Forty-eight patients developed a heart rate of greater than 95 beats/minute or 20% more than pre-induction values at an average time of 34 minutes after tracheal intubation and received placebo (15 patients), esmolol 50 mg (16 patients), or esmolol 100 mg (17 patients). Controlled intervention was instituted if heart rate or blood pressure was not adequate. Both 50 and 100 mg of esmolol resulted in lower heart rates compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), with no difference between the two esmolol groups (p greater than 0.05). Patients who received placebo had more episodes of medical intervention than those given esmolol (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects occurred in any patient. 
Inhibition by a new bisphosphonate (AHBuBP) of bone resorption induced by the MBT-2 tumor of mice. A new bisphosphonate, 4-amino-1-hydroxybuthylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (AHBuBP), was compared with 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (AHPrBP) and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (HEBP) in terms of its effect on tumor-induced osteolysis using a bladder tumor in mice (MBT-2). Tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously (SC) over the calvaria in mice, resulting in a local tumor causing fragmentation of the bone. The tumor-induced osteolysis associated with osteoclasts proliferation was accompanied with reactive new bone formation. This osteolysis was evaluated by measuring the increased area of bone resorption in reduced opacity to radiograph and histologic study. The results showed the following sequence of potency: AHBuBP greater than AHPrBP = HEBP. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the MBT-2 tumor. The authors conclude that AHBuBP appears to be an interesting new bisphosphonate with possible clinical application. 
Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for occult bacteremia: clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Decision analysis was used to evaluate the probable health benefits, complications, and costs of six management strategies for febrile children at risk for occult bacteremia. The strategy that combined blood culture with empiric oral antibiotic treatment for all patients was predicted to prevent the highest number of major infections and to have the lowest cost per major infection prevented. The strategy that combined a leukocyte count and blood culture for all patients, followed by empiric antibiotic treatment for those with leukocyte count greater than or equal to 10,000/mm3, had almost equal cost and clinical effectiveness and avoided many antibiotic complications. Culture of blood specimens from all patients and no empiric treatment constituted the third most clinically effective intervention but was the least cost-effective in this model. Giving a 2-day oral course of amoxicillin without testing had the lowest average cost per febrile patient but was the least clinically effective intervention. However, the low degree of effectiveness of empiric treatment alone was based on the assumption that oral amoxicillin therapy was only 20% effective in preventing major infections after bacteremia. At higher estimates of effectiveness, treatment alone became a more viable strategy. We conclude that approaches which combine blood culture with empiric antibiotic treatment are the most clinically effective and the most cost-effective strategies for children at risk for occult bacteremia. 
The consistency of pulse frequencies and pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) used by chronic pain patients. This study records the consistency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) pulse frequency and pulse pattern used by 13 chronic patients over a 1 year period. The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions. Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory. This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system. 
Intensive liver care and management of acute hepatic failure. In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option. 
High rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. 
Functioning insulinoma--incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival of patients: a 60-year study. For the 60-year period from 1927 through 1986, we assessed the incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival among all Mayo Clinic patients with histologically confirmed functioning insulinoma. With use of the complete medical record system at Mayo and the comprehensive epidemiologic data base of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we found 224 patients in whom an initial pancreatic exploration at Mayo had confirmed the presence of insulinoma. The median age (and range) of these patients at surgical diagnosis was 47 (8 to 82) years, and 59% were female patients. During the study period, eight cases of insulinoma occurred among residents of Olmsted County; their age and gender distributions were similar to those of the total cohort. The incidence of insulinoma among residents of Olmsted County increased during the study period to a stable level during the last 2 decades of 4 cases per 1 million person-years. For the total cohort, 7.6% had multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), and 5.8% had malignant insulinoma. The risk of recurrence was greater among patients with MEN I (21% at 10 and 20 years) than in those without MEN I (5% at 10 years and 7% at 20 years). Although survival of the total cohort was not significantly impaired, it was significantly worse than expected for patients with malignant insulinoma (29% versus 88% expected at 10 years postoperatively). We conclude that insulinoma is less rare than previously suspected. After successful surgical removal, the long-term risk of recurrent insulinoma is relatively high in patients with MEN I; for patients with benign disease, the long-term survival is normal. 
Bowel perforation and interstitial cystitis in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. A 13-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain, fever, dysuria, incontinence and pyuria and was subsequently diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with extensive gastrointestinal involvement and an associated interstitial cystitis. Despite aggressive therapy with high dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide she developed a small bowel perforation and subsequently died. The combination of bowel symptoms and interstitial cystitis seems unique to the population with SLE, while the separate complication of bowel perforation carries an extremely poor prognosis in this group of patients. 
A comparative analysis of mass transport models in peritoneal dialysis. To better understand the differences in published estimates of peritoneal mass transport coefficients, a comparative analysis of seven mathematical models of peritoneal transport was performed. Uniform investigation involving measurements of solute concentrations and accurate determination of peritoneal dialysate volume was undertaken in twenty-eight 6 hour dwell studies using 3.86% glucose dialysate in non-diabetic patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The investigated models were all based on the theory of transport across a homogeneous membrane. Diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) calculated during a period of dialysate isovolemia served as reference values in the comparative analysis. The evaluation of models involved calculations of transport coefficients and comparison of calculated dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratios (D/P) with experimental D/P. The best fit of theoretically predicted D/P to experimental D/P was obtained with Pyle-Popovich's model, which accounts for both the diffusive (KBD) and convective (sieving coefficient [S]) characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. Garred's model, assuming S = 1, yielded acceptable results for small solutes (except sodium), whereas Henderson's model, in which convective transport is neglected, proved to be surprisingly accurate for KBD for both small solutes (except sodium) and protein. S values (mean +/- SD) calculated using Pyle-Popovich's model were found to be out of the physically interpretable range for glucose (S = -0.38 +/- 0.48) and potassium (S = 1.57 +/- 0.19), and therefore these S values should be treated as phenomenologic rather than physical quantities. 
A new balanced operation for complex gastroesophageal reflux disease. Twenty-seven patients with advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease have been treated with combined transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy and Collis-Nissen fundoplication. Gastric acid analyses (n = 20) obtained preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively demonstrated a significant late reduction in gastric acid output. Twenty-six patients (96%) have experienced relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease at a mean of 13.3 months (range, 6 to 25 months) without postvagotomy symptoms. Transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy may be considered as an adjunct to mechanical surgical control of advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
Loss of heterozygosity for alleles on chromosome II in cervical carcinoma. The HeLa cell (a cervical carcinoma cell line) tumor-suppressor gene has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular genetic studies of nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids derived from normal chromosome 11 x HeLa cell fusions. In the present study, 33 primary cervical carcinoma samples were analyzed using chromosome 11-specific polymorphic DNA markers. The RFLP analysis indicated a somatic loss of chromosome 11 heterozygosity in 10 (30%) of the primary tumors. Preferential loss of the long arm of the chromosome was observed in two of the primary tumors. In addition, at least eight-fold amplification of sequences in the q13 region, including those coding for the fibroblast growth factor-related gene (int-2), was observed in one of the primary tumors. These results suggest a possible role for gene(s) localized to chromosome 11, possibly that localized to the long arm in the development and/or progression of cervical carcinomas. 
A hepatitis B virus mutant associated with an epidemic of fulminant hepatitis BACKGROUND. A nosocomial outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B occurred in five patients in Haifa, Israel. Previous investigations identified the suspected source as a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen who was positive for antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen and had chronic liver disease. We examined the strain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) that caused this epidemic, in order to identify specific mutations in the precore or core region. METHODS. The presence of HBV was identified by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification of viral DNA in serum from the source patient, the five patients with fulminant hepatitis B, and five controls with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The amplified viral HBV DNA samples were then cloned and sequenced. RESULTS. Sequence analysis of viral DNA established that the same HBV mutant with two mutations in the precore region was present in the source patient and the five patients with fulminant hepatic failure. This HBV mutant had significant sequence divergence from other known HBV subtypes in the X, precore, and core regions. Cloned HBV DNA derived from a hospitalized patient who had subclinical hepatitis B at the same time as the outbreak and from four other control subjects with acute, self-limited hepatitis B all contained the wild-type sequence in the precore region. CONCLUSIONS. In the outbreak we studied, a mutant hepatitis B viral strain was transmitted from a common source to five patients who subsequently died of fulminant hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations hepatitis B infection. Naturally occurring viral mutations in the HBV genome may predispose the infected host to more severe liver injury. 
The neurofibroma in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis has a unicellular origin. von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is the most common hereditary syndrome predisposing to neoplasia. NF1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a single gene which maps to chromosome 17q11.2. The most common symptomatic manifestation of NF1 is the benign neurofibroma. Our previous studies of tumors in NF1, studies which detected a loss of heterozygosity for DNA markers from the NF1 region of chromosome 17 in malignant tumors, did not detect a loss in neurofibromas. We report here that a more extensive study, including the analysis of neurofibromas from 19 unrelated NF1 patients by using seven probes, failed to detect a single instance of loss of heterozygosity. This finding suggests that neurofibromas are either polyclonal or monoclonal in origin but arise by a mechanism different from that of NF1 malignancies. In order to investigate the first possibility, we analyzed neurofibromas from female NF1 patients by using an X chromosome-specific probe, from the phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) gene, which detects an RFLP. The detected alleles carry additional recognition sites for the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, so that the allele derived from the active X chromosome is digested by HpaII while the one from the hypermethylated, inactive X chromosome is not. We analyzed neurofibromas from 30 unrelated females with NF1. Eight patients were heterozygous for the PGK RFLP. By this assay, neurofibromas from all eight appeared monoclonal in origin. These results suggest that benign neurofibromas in NF1 arise by a mechanism that is different from that of malignant tumors. 
Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy in a patient with previous esophagectomy. Establishment of a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy via direct jejunal puncture was accomplished in a 45-year-old woman five years after a partial esophagectomy with cervical esophagogastrostomy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The patient had recurrence of the cancer at the anastomotic site with subsequent inability to eat, necessitating a feeding tube for prolonged enteral nutrition. Although percutaneous puncture of the jejunum has been previously described, it has been limited to patients who had undergone partial or complete gastrectomies with Bilroth II anastomoses. This case report of direct endoscopic jejunal tube placement in a patient after esophagectomy further establishes this procedure as a viable alternative to surgically placed feeding tubes in patients with altered gastric anatomy. 
Treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan. The Subcutaneous Sumatriptan International Study Group BACKGROUND. The headache in migraine attacks may be caused by dilatation of certain cranial arteries or arteriovenous anastomoses, by neurogenic dural plasma extravasation, or by both of these mechanisms. Sumatriptan, a novel selective agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine-like receptors, blocks these phenomena. We investigated its efficacy in migraine. METHODS. We studied 639 patients with migraine attacks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. We assessed the effect of subcutaneous injections of 6 or 8 mg of sumatriptan or placebo on the severity of headache and associated migrane symptoms 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment. Patients who were not free of pain after 60 minutes subsequently received placebo if they had initially received placebo or 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo if they had initially received 6 mg of sumatriptan. RESULTS. After 60 minutes, the severity of headache was decreased in 72 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 68 to 76 percent) of the 422 patients given 6 mg of sumatriptan, 79 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 71 to 87 percent) of the 109 patients given 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 33 percent) of the 105 patients given placebo (data on 3 patients could not be evaluated). As compared with the placebo group, 47 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 38 to 57 percent) more patients who had received 6 mg of sumatriptan and 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 65 percent) more patients who had received 8 mg of sumatriptan had a decrease in the severity of headache (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). After 120 minutes, 86 to 92 percent of the 511 patients treated with sumatriptan (202 assigned to 6 mg plus placebo, 203 to 6 mg plus 6 mg, and 106 to 8 mg plus placebo) had improvement in the severity of headache, as compared with only 37 percent of the 104 patients who received placebo once or twice (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Twenty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because of missing data (19) or protocol violations (2). The response rates did not differ significantly among the sumatriptan regimens. Adverse events were minor and transient in all groups. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan given subcutaneously is a highly effective, rapid-acting, and well-tolerated treatment for migrane attacks. The administration of a second dose 60 minutes later to patients not responding well to an initial dose affords little additional benefit. 
Differential modulation by the stress axis of ethanol withdrawal seizure expression in WSP and WSR mice. Withdrawal from both acute and chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure is associated with increased neural excitability and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are necessary for EtOH withdrawal seizure expression. Lines of mice that were selected for severe (WSP) and minimal (WSR) EtOH withdrawal (as estimated from handling-induced convulsion scores) have been shown to differ in their stress response following an acute dose of EtOH. In this study we provide evidence that these lines of mice also differ in their sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. EtOH withdrawal seizures of WSP mice were significantly increased by chronic and acute corticosterone treatment, whereas those of the WSR mice were unaffected. Neural excitability was decreased in the WSP mice when aminoglutethimide, a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker, was administered. Thus, it appears that genetic differences in EtOH withdrawal seizure severity may be due, in part, to differences in sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. 
Current role of catheter ablative procedures in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. A report for health professionals from the Subcommittee on Electrocardiography and Electrophysiology, American Heart Association. Catheter ablative techniques have assumed an increasingly important role in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory cardiac arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of the AV junction is considered the procedure of choice for management of patients without bypass tracts with drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. Catheter techniques have been used with increasing frequency in attempts to ablate accessory AV tracts. These techniques currently appear to be less effective than surgical techniques but involve less morbidity and expense. In some centers, accessory pathway ablation using catheter techniques is the procedure of first choice in selected patients with drug-refractory tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway. Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia should be reserved for patients with mappable ventricular tachycardia who are not candidates for cardiac electrosurgery or insertion of an automatic defibrillator. The development of more flexible catheters and more manageable energy delivery systems holds promise for more effective catheter techniques. 
A phase I-II trial of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin and fluorouracil in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a report from the UCL-Oncology Group, Belgium. Eighty-three patients (median age, 56 years and Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70) were treated with carboplatin (Carbo) and fluorouracil (5Fu) for stage III and IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 5Fu (1 g/m2/d) was administered from day 1 to 4 by continuous infusion. Carbo was given on day 1 and, in order to evaluate its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), the dose level was progressively increased from 250 mg/m2 to 450 mg/m2. The effectiveness of this association and its potential role in local control were also evaluated. Three patients received Carbo at a dose of 250 mg/m2, 13 received 300 mg/m2, one received 330 mg/m2, 12 received 350 mg/m2, six received 375 mg/m2, 26 received 400 mg/m2, 18 received 420 mg/m2, and four received 450 mg/m2. Two (13 of 83) or three courses (64 of 83), repeated every 4 weeks, were administered. The overall (primary tumor and node) response and complete response (CR) rates were 33% and 14%, respectively. For primary tumor, the response rate (RR) was 57% with 32% CR and 18% pathologic complete response (PCR); the RR was higher for patients with oropharyngeal tumor (76%, P = .037) and for patients treated with Carbo greater than or equal to 350 mg/m2 (65%, P = .02); the tumor size (T1 + T2 v T3 + T4) was a good prognostic factor for RR (90% v 46%, P = .001), CR (65% v 20%, P less than .001), and PCR (45% v 8%, P less than .001). For nodes, the RR was 33% with 11% CR. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were experienced by 17% and 28% of the patients treated with 420 mg/m2 of Carbo and by 50% of the patients treated with 450 mg/m2. The MTD can be fixed at 420 mg/m2 and the proposed dose at 400 mg/m2. Thirty-eight patients were treated with surgery plus radiotherapy, 33 with radiotherapy alone, and seven with surgery alone. The median follow-up is 12 months. The 18-month disease-free survival (DFS) is 78% for overall complete responders and 39% for the others (P = .04). There is no primary tumor recurrence among the 12 patients with a primary tumor PCR treated by radiotherapy alone for tumor control (median follow-up, 17.3 months). The association of Carbo-5Fu is a safe induction chemotherapy regimen for HNSCC. The proposed dose of Carbo for future treatment is 400 mg/m2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Induction of apoptosis during normal and neoplastic B-cell development in the bursa of Fabricius. The lymphoid cells of embryonic bursal follicles are engaged in rapid growth and preimmune diversification of immunoglobulin genes. Disruption of follicular architecture by mechanical dispersion of these cells in short-term tissue culture was accompanied by continued cell division and extensive cell death by apoptosis. Apoptosis was suppressed in parallel cultures of intact follicles. gamma Radiation also triggered extensive apoptosis in embryonic bursal follicles within a few hours. Preneoplastic bursal stem cell populations induced by a v-myc oncogene were hypersensitive to induction of apoptosis by follicular dispersion and radiation. In contrast, tumor progression in v-myc- and v-rel-initiated bursal neoplasms was accompanied by development of resistance to induction of apoptosis. A programmed cell death pathway can be activated during normal B-cell development in the bursa, and alterations in the expression of this pathway accompany neoplastic change in this system. 
Simplified formula for the calculation of mitral valve area: potential inaccuracies in patients with tachycardia. A simplified formula (cardiac output/[transvalvular pressure gradient]1/2) has been proposed as an alternative to the Gorlin equation for determining valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. This study was done (a) to assess the relationship between the results of the simplified formula and those of the Gorlin equation in patients with mitral stenosis and (b) to determine the clinical characteristics most likely to be associated with a disparity between the 2 formulae. In 96 patients with mitral stenosis, the disparity between the 2 formulae was greater than 0.2 cm2 in 43 (45%) and greater than or equal to 0.35 cm2 in 21 (22%). The results of the simplified formula were especially likely to be disparate from those of the Gorlin equation in those whose heart rates were greater than 100 beats/minute. Thus, in the patient with mitral stenosis, the simplified formula should be used with caution and cognizance of its potential inaccuracy, particularly if the patient is tachycardic. 
Automated measurement of tumour extent in patients with colorectal liver metastases from X-ray computed tomography. Tumour burden is a significant prognostic factor in patients with colorectal liver metastases, and can be staged according to percentage hepatic replacement (PHR), but accurate measurements of PHR are difficult to obtain. We have used an automated computerized technique to isolate tumour and measure PHR from computed tomography images of 22 patients. Tumour identification was achieved by establishing local histogram-based thresholds at liver-tumour boundaries displaying clear bimodal histogram distributions. There was a significant association between measured PHR and independent visual estimates of PHR stage defined in quartiles (p less than 0.001). When the measured value of PHR differed from the PHR stage, the visual estimate was always higher. The accuracy of PHR measurement was assessed on stimulated liver computed tomography images. It seems likely that visual estimates of PHR from computed tomography images tend to overestimate tumour extent. The automated technique is probably more accurate and will be useful for assessing and monitoring patients. 
Effect of diltiazem on symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of ST segment depression occurring during daily life and during exercise. BACKGROUND. Silent myocardial ischemia is an adverse prognostic marker in patients with coronary disease; however, controlled data on the effect of treatment are sparse and contradictory, and the relations among the occurrence of ST segment depression, drug efficacy, and heart rate are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease, a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Treadmill exercise tests and 72-hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained at the end of two 2-week treatment periods with sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg b.i.d. or equivalent placebo. Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression decreased by 50% or more in 70% of the patients from a median number of 4.5 (range, 0-19) to 1.5 (range, 0-13) (p = 0.0001); their cumulative duration also decreased from 78.5 (range, 0-60) to 24.5 (range, 0-411) minutes (p = 0.001). No circadian variation was found in the efficacy of diltiazem. The occurrence of ischemic type ST segment depression was modulated by changes in heart rate rather than by absolute heart rate. Diltiazem also improved exercise test end points but to a lesser extent. Time to ST segment depression increased to 341 +/- 148 from 296 +/- 154 seconds (p = 0.005). Although less frequent with diltiazem administration (45 versus 54 patients, p less than 0.03), exercise-induced ST depression was more often asymptomatic (98% versus 72% of patients, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Diltiazem reduces the frequency and severity of ischemic type ST depression in patients with stable coronary artery disease. 
Relation between nicotine intake and Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE--To study the association between Alzheimer's disease and nicotine intake through smoking. DESIGN--Population based case-control study. SETTING--City of Rotterdam and four northern provinces of The Netherlands. SUBJECTS--198 patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, 198 controls matched for age and sex, and families of 17 patients in whom Alzheimer's disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age of onset of dementia, relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS--89 of 193 patients with Alzheimer's disease had a history of smoking compared with 102 of 195 controls. Among the patients and controls with a family history of dementia, smoking was significantly less common in those with dementia (40/95 with dementia v 55/96 controls; relative risk 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.78). The risk of Alzheimer's disease decreased with increasing daily number of cigarettes smoked before onset of disease (relative risk 0.3 in those smoking greater than 21/day v 1 in non-smokers). In six families in which the disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, the mean age of onset was 4.17 years later in smoking patients than in non-smoking patients from the same family (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS--These findings suggest an inverse association between smoking and Alzheimer's disease, although smoking cannot be advocated for other health reasons. We speculate that nicotine may have a role in the aetiology of both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Internal jugular vein thrombosis after ovulation induction with gonadotropins. An unusual case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complicated by internal jugular vein and mediastinal thrombosis is presented. Hemoconcentration and perhaps immobilization appear to be the most probable causative factors. The patient was successfully treated with heparin anticoagulation. An uneventful twin pregnancy resulted from the stimulation cycle. 
Secondary ischaemia in rabbit skin flaps: the roles played by thromboxane and free radicals. 1. Biochemical mechanisms of ischaemia were investigated in rabbit skin flaps subjected to 2 h of primary ischaemia then, 24 h later, to 4 h of secondary ischaemia. During secondary ischaemia, flaps underwent either total ischaemia (arterial and venous blood supply occluded) or partial ischaemia (vein only occluded). Some of these flaps were treated at the time of reperfusion with the free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and/or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38,485. 2. After 30 min of reperfusion, superoxide dismutase treatment significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels, elevated during ischaemia. Superoxide dismutase also reduced tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and xanthine oxidase, indicators of free-radical damage, and restored the depleted tissue levels of superoxide dismutase. 3. UK-38,485 treatment failed to significantly alter any of these tissue free-radical parameters, although this agent significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels. 4. Combined superoxide dismutase plus UK-38,485 treatment was not significantly better than either treatment alone with respect to any parameter. 5. Partial ischaemia led to consistently higher levels of tissue free radicals and blood thromboxane than did total ischaemia. Thus partial ischaemia appears to result in greater free-radical damage than total ischaemia. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane acts as a mediator for free-radical damage in the ischaemic changes within the flap. 
Smoking and the risk of first acute myocardial infarction. When analyzing risk factors for first acute myocardial infarction in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a large prospective population study of 20,000 men and women, smoking was found to influence risk significantly in a dose-dependent manner, the risk increasing 2% to 3% for each gram of tobacco smoked daily. Risk was particularly associated with inhalation, the risk for inhalers being almost twice that of noninhalers. No difference in risk could be demonstrated between various types of tobacco (pipe, cigar/cheroots, or plain and filtered cigarettes). The risk seemed associated with current smoking only, inasmuch as the duration of the smoking habit was not important. Ex-smokers had the same risk as those who had never smoked regardless of duration of smoking and time elapsed since quitting. Relative excess risk was significantly higher in female smokers than in male smokers, and daily alcohol intake appeared to have some protective effect on the risk of first acute myocardial infarction among heavy smokers. 
Myocardial distribution of indium-111-antimyosin Fab in acute inferior and right ventricular infarction: comparison with technetium-99m-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination In a postmortem study of a 69-yr-old female patient who had suffered 2 yr previously a non-Q-wave anterior infarction and who had sustained just seven days earlier a left inferior and right ventricular infarction, the distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab was compared to the results of 99mTc-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination. Indium-111-antimyosin Fab imaging could not be performed because of cardiogenic shock. However, postmortem gamma scintillation counting revealed increased activities of antimyosin Fab in the inferoapical and right ventricular infarcted regions in which 99mTc-pyrophosphate positive imagings were observed; in contrast, a histologically confirmed old subendocardial anterior infarction had no definite activity. Thus, the myocardial distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab corresponded well to the results of 99mTc scintigrams and histologic examinations in a human heart, suggesting that this technique could be useful in vivo for detecting several-day-old myocardial infarction of the right ventricle as well as the left ventricle. Tissue from the 2-yr-old infarction was not identified by this technique. 
Interleukin-2 and spontaneous hypertension. There are conflicting reports with regard to the antihypertensive of interleukin-2 in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Recently, the original claim of a normalization of arterial pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat after a single administration of interleukin-2 has been disputed. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine whether the administration of interleukin-2 was effective in attenuating both the development and maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Both young prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension received a single subcutaneous dose of 5,000 units/kg human recombinant interleukin-2. Arterial pressure was monitored at weekly intervals in both control and treated animals by the tail-cuff technique. Interleukin-2 administered as a one time single injection had no effect on the development of hypertension in the young animals or on the maintenance of hypertension in the adult animals. Interleukin-2 also was administered as a continuous infusion via osmotic minipumps at dose levels of 5,000 and 50,000 units/kg/wk to both young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Continuous administration of interleukin-2 also had no effect on the development or maintenance of spontaneous hypertension. Therefore, this study firmly demonstrates that interleukin-2 has no effect on the onset or maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
The buccinator myomucosal island pedicle flap: anatomic study and case report. The buccinator myomucosal island pedicle flap is a useful means of introducing relatively large amounts of vascularized mucosa into the oral cavity. Using cadaver dissections and clinical cases, the anatomy and clinical relevance of this tissue are defined. Emphasis is placed on the technical caveats and pitfalls of the procedure. 
Cell population depletion associated with fetal alcohol brain damage: mechanisms of BAC-dependent cell loss. Neuronal death is one of the most serious consequences of alcohol exposure during development. Studies described in this paper used a neonatal rat model to address factors affecting neuronal death following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain growth, and relate them to possible mechanisms of damage. The profile of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) is an important variable influencing both brain growth deficits and neuronal death--a smaller daily dose of alcohol can be more damaging than a larger daily dose, if it is consumed in a binge-like pattern that produces relatively higher BACs. Alcohol exposure for a single day also can be damaging, producing both brain growth deficits and neuron loss, if high BACs are obtained. Various brain regions and different neuronal populations within a given brain area exhibit different degrees of vulnerability. Some neuronal loss clearly is a function of cell death due to direct effects of alcohol, while other deficits may be due to either primary or secondary effects of the alcohol insult. In the cerebellum, a maturational or metabolic factor also appears to be involved with alcohol-induced neuronal death. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) indicated that cerebellar lobules containing Purkinje cells that are in the process of extending dendrites are ones that are more vulnerable to alcohol than lobules containing Purkinje cells that mature later. Alcohol exposure during brain development may be producing neuron attrition in multiple ways, including disruption of membrane integrity, inhibition of protein synthesis or other alterations such as lipid solubility, or by disruption of cytoskeletal elements. 
Kikuchi's necrotising lymphadenitis. Three cases of Kikuchi's necrotizing lymphadenitis without granulocytic infiltration presented to the ENT department as cervical lymphadenopathy with neutropaenia. Differential diagnosis from malignant lymphoma was difficult both clinically and histopathologically. Two recovered spontaneously without treatment within three months, one improved initially but was lost to follow-up after one month. 
Simultaneous assessment of inflammation and epidermal proliferation in psoriatic plaques during long-term treatment with the vitamin D3 analogue MC903: modulations and interrelations. The influence of topical application of MC903, an analogue of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, on psoriatic plaques was investigated during a long-term treatment study. The parameters for epidermal growth and for inflammation were assessed on frozen sections using immunohistochemical methods to elucidate their modulations in time and the interrelations between the different cell types involved during treatment with MC903. Biopsies were taken before and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies against the hyperproliferation-associated keratin 16, against cycling nuclei, and against T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and CD14-positive cells were used in combination with a polyclonal antibody against polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)-elastase. The earliest change was a statistically significant decrease in PMN after 1 week of treatment followed by a decline of cycling nuclei after 2 weeks. These changes preceded a decrease of T lymphocytes which occurred after 4 weeks. Keratin 16 content tended to diminish after 4 weeks of treatment. CD14+ cells decreased slightly during the observation period, whereas Langerhans cells tended to increase. No B lymphocytes were found. These results suggest that MC903 influences the number of PMN and epidermal growth rather than the number of T lymphocytes. 
Combination therapy of OK432 and recombinant human interferon alpha A/D on viral myocarditis in mice starting after infection. We investigated the effects of OK432, recombinant human interferon alpha A/D (rIFN alpha A/D) and a combination of these drugs on murine acute myocarditis due to encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were administered 1 KE of OK432 and 10(4)U/g of rIFN alpha A/D starting 24 hr after viral inoculation for 14 days. The survival rate of mice having the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of untreated mice on day 21 (15 of 20 vs. 6 of 20, P less than .001), whereas the viral titer in the heart, the heart weight/body weight ratio and the scores for myocardial inflammation and necrosis were significantly lower. On the other hand, therapy with OK432 or rIFN alpha A/D individually improved neither the survival rate nor the extent of myocardial damage. The natural killer cell activity in the combination therapy mice on day 3 after infection was significantly increased in comparison with untreated mice (46.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 37.7 +/- 2.8%, P less than .01), and the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages was increased (45.0 vs. 26.7%). Thus, the combination therapy of OK432 and rIFN alpha A/D was more effective than the therapy with OK432 alone or rIFN alpha A/D alone against acute viral myocarditis when the treatment was started early after infection, and the stimulation of host immunologic response by OK432 may be important for this combination therapy. 
Severity of Helicobacter-induced gastric injury correlates with gastric juice ammonia. We postulated that ammonia produced by Helicobacter pylori may contribute to gastric mucosal injury. This hypothesis was evaluated in Helicobacter-positive patients with chronic renal failure in whom a high urea concentration might amplify this phenomenon. Gastric urea and ammonia were measured, and the severity of gastritis was evaluated by counting mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. High gastric ammonia and low urea in Helicobacter-positive patients, and the converse in Helicobacter-negative subjects, were observed. There was a significant correlation between gastric ammonia and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration (P less than 0.05), suggesting a causal link. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori was associated with a decrease of ammonia and an increase of urea (P less than 0.01). The significant correlation between the severity of gastric inflammation and the gastric juice ammonia concentration suggests that ammonia may play a pathogenic role in Helicobacter-associated gastric injury. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
Death by embolization of prosthetic aortic valve. This report describes a case in which a young woman died from embolization of her prosthetic aortic valve. The discussion includes the embolization's association with chronic intravenous narcotism, recurrent bacterial endocarditis, and acute cocaine toxicity. 
Plasma antigen levels of the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor in patient samples. Human plasma contains an inhibitor of tissue factor-initiated coagulation known as the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) or also known as the extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI). A competitive fluorescent immunoassay was developed to measure the plasma concentration of LACI in samples from normal individuals and patients with a variety of diseases. The LACI concentration in an adult control population varied from 60% to 160% of the mean with a mean value corresponding to 89 ng/mL or 2.25 nmol/L. Plasma LACI levels were not decreased in patients with severe chronic hepatic failure, warfarin therapy, primary pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, or the lupus anticoagulant. Plasma LACI antigen was decreased in some, but not all patients with gram-negative bacteremia and evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Plasma LACI levels were elevated in women undergoing the early stages of labor (29%), in patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (45%), and in patients receiving intravenous heparin (375%). A radioligand blot of the pre- and post-heparin plasma samples shows the increase to be in a 40-Kd form of LACI. Very low levels of plasma LACI antigen were found in patients with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia, diseases associated with low plasma levels of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins. Following the injection of heparin into one patient with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia, the plasma LACI antigen level increased to a level comparable with that in normal individuals after heparin treatment. 
Altered lipid profile after Kawasaki syndrome. BACKGROUND. Delineation of lipid values in children after Kawasaki syndrome is important because of the predilection of this disease for the coronary arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides using enzymatic methods in 105 patients with a history of Kawasaki syndrome. Measurements were obtained during six time periods: 10 days or less, 11-31 days, 1-3 months, 3-12 months, 1-3 years, and more than 3 years. Total cholesterol was depressed in the first interval (122.0 +/- 19.8 mg/dl, mean +/- SD), but the mean values were normal in all periods after clinical recovery (overall mean, 149.0 +/- 24.0 mg/dl). High density lipoprotein cholesterol was also depressed in the first interval (15.2 +/- 9.9 mg/dl); although high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly with duration since disease onset (p less than 0.001), it remained significantly lower than expected (p less than 0.001), even in the latest interval (47.2 +/- 10.9 mg/dl). Nonfasting triglyceride levels were high (162.5 +/- 63.4 mg/dl) in the first interval and then diminished steadily with time, but this relation did not achieve statistical significance. We compared adjusted lipid levels (z scores) of 46 Kawasaki patients after clinical recovery with those of their parents; patients had similar total cholesterol levels but significantly lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.021 for mothers, p = 0.001 for fathers). Mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol after clinical recovery tended to be lower in patients with persistent coronary abnormalities than in those without such lesions (p = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS. Kawasaki syndrome is associated with important abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Continued long-term surveillance of this population is necessary to monitor lipid levels and their relation to future development of coronary atherosclerosis. 
Rheumatoid arthritis in Israeli Jews: shared sequences in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles are associated with susceptibility. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be associated with class II HLA antigens in most populations, but recent studies in Israeli Jewish patients showed no significant differences in either DR4 or DR1 between patients and controls. In a previous DR4 subset study we found DR4-Dw15 to be associated with susceptibility (RR = 9.2) but this allele occurred in only 12% of the patients. We analyzed all DRB1 genes, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides, in 49 Jewish patients with RA and 40 normal Jewish controls. Six DRB1 alleles that are similar to the prototype DR4-Dw4 (DRB1*0401) appeared to contribute to the risk for developing RA. In addition to DR4-Dw15 (DRB1*0405) 2 other alleles having substitutions in codons 71 only (DR1-Dw1/DRB1*0101, DR4-Dw14.2/DRB1*0408) or in codons 70 and 71 (DRw10/DRB1*1001) gave highly significant relative risks. Together, this group, with valine in position 85, and glycine in codon 86, gave a relative risk of 11.0 (p = 0.0002). Two other alleles with the same sequence in the third hypervariable region (amino acids 67-74) but with valine in codon 86 (DR4-Dw14.1/DRB1*0404) or alanine in 85 and valine in 86 (DR1-Dw20, DRB1*0102) gave a combined risk of 3.6 (p = 0.049). Altogether these 7 alleles with similar sequences in the third hypervariable region accounted for 55.6% of the patients, with an overall relative risk of 8.6 (p = 0.00002). Our results in this population indicate that shared epitopes in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles also play a role in susceptibility to RA. 
Transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac source of embolism in stroke patients. To compare the diagnostic yields of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism, 63 patients (mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 15 [range 18-87] years) with transient ischemic attacks or stroke underwent both procedures. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 14% (nine) of the patients, all of whom had clinical evidence of heart disease. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 41% (26) of the patients; 27% (seven) of these patients had no clinical cardiovascular abnormalities. Abnormalities detected only by transesophageal echocardiography in the patients with unsuspected cardiac disease included atrial septal aneurysm in two, patent foramen ovale in two, left atrial appendage thrombus in one, and myxomatous mitral valve in two. The 26 patients with an identified cardiac source of embolism were older (67.5 versus 59.4 years, p = 0.04), more frequently in atrial fibrillation (62% [16] versus 8% [3], p less than 0.0001), had a larger left atrium (43 versus 37 mm, p = 0.01) and more commonly had left ventricular hypertrophy (62% [16] versus 32% [12], p less than 0.02) than the 37 patients in whom no cardiac source of embolism was identified. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemic events. 
Paediatric blood pressure and anaesthesia. One percent of children have appreciably and consistently raised arterial blood pressure. A 7-year-old girl admitted for routine tonsillectomy, had unrecognised hypertension which put her at increased risk. Should anaesthetic practice take more note of paediatric blood pressures?. 
The quantitative study of lumbar vertebral bone marrow using T1 mapping and image analysis techniques: methodology and preliminary results. A method of quantifying lumbar vertebral bone marrow using pixel by pixel T1 mapping of spin echo magnetic resonance images is described. The accuracy and precision of the relaxation time measurements is confirmed by studies with the EEC Concerted Research Project, test object no. 5. The T1 data from all the pixels sampled from lumbar vertebral marrow are displayed as a histogram. By "thresholding" relative to normal control data the spatial distribution of high or low T1 pixels can be demonstrated. The approach is superior to that of the conventional region of interest method for quantifying and analysing relaxation time data, and allows tissue heterogeneity to be studied. Studies in patients with aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemia have been performed. 
Effect of enteric pacing on intestinal motility and hormone secretion in dogs with short bowel. The present study was designed to examine the role of electrode position during retrograde pacing in dogs with short bowel syndrome and unsevered intact duodenum. In nine beagle dogs a subtotal resection of the small bowel and jejunoileostomy was performed. In five of these dogs, an isolated blind loop (jejunum) with preserved mesenteric connections was left in situ as an additional place for a stimulation electrode. Small intestinal motility and plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, somatostatin, and glucose were examined during pacing of the residual jejunum or the isolated loop, respectively, compared with control experiments in the same dogs without pacing. During pacing of the loop a significant (P less than 0.05-0.01) decrease in the postprandial small intestinal motility index was observed combined with a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma insulin levels, whereas the postprandial increase in glucagon, somatostatin, gastrin, and glucose levels was not different from that in controls. In contrast, pacing of the jejunum increased postprandial small intestinal motility index (less than or equal to 68%), whereas the levels of the four hormones and plasma glucose were not different from those in controls. The data suggest that in dogs with intact duodenum, pacing on an excluded loop is required to obtain the desired effect of reduced intestinal motility and improved anabolic pancreatic hormone secretion. 
Non-typhoid Salmonella in renal transplant recipients: a report of twenty cases and review of the literature. We report 20 cases of non-typhoid Salmonella infection that occurred over a period of 10 years in 592 renal transplant recipients followed by our unit, and present a review of 58 previously reported cases. Analysis of these data suggests that infection occurs when immunosuppression is high (early in the post-transplant period, or after anti-rejection therapy). A significant number of patients have bacteraemia and widespread focal manifestations are common. Despite prolonged antibiotic therapy, relapses occur commonly causing significant morbidity, occasional graft loss and even death. 
Systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic effects of a dopaminergic dose of dopamine in patients with cirrhosis. The effects of dopamine on kidney function have not been elucidated in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, although increased portal pressure has been observed with supradopaminergic doses of dopamine in these patients, the splanchnic hemodynamic effects of low doses of dopamine have not been previously studied. Thus we studied the acute systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic effects of a dopaminergic dose of dopamine (1.5 micrograms/kg body wt min) in nine cirrhotic patients. Plasma dopamine levels increased markedly from 35 +/- 20 pg/ml to 31,400 +/- 4,900 pg/ml during dopamine administration. A significant diastolic pressure decrease of 10% was associated with a 15% increase in heart rate. Cardiac output was not altered. Although dopamine significantly increased azygos blood flow by 16%, wedged and free hepatic venous pressures were not altered. Dopamine significantly increased renal blood flow by 31%, but did not change the glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that a dopaminergic dose of dopamine increases azygos blood flow but not the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Finally, although it increases renal blood flow, dopamine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on glomerular filtration rate in cirrhotic patients. 
Effects of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on cerebral blood flow in awake hypertensive rats. As chronic hypertension shifts the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation to higher pressure levels, we studied the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril on mean arterial pressure (mean BP), basal CBF, and CBF autoregulation in awake renovascular hypertensive (2 kidneys, 1 clip model) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Blood pressure was measured via a chronically implanted arterial cannula and CBF by hydrogen clearance. Chronic renovascular hypertension, like spontaneous hypertension, caused a marked shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation but did not alter basal CBF. In SHR, acute administration of perindopril did not diminish CBF in spite of the fact that BP fell to a level below the lower limit of CBF autoregulation (determined by hypotensive hemorrhage). Chronic treatment of renovascular hypertensive rats with perindopril normalized BP and restored CBF autoregulation. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Validation of in vivo receptor measurements via in vitro radioassay: technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin as prototype model Hepatic binding protein (HBP) is a hepatocyte-specific receptor for serum asialoglycoproteins. The receptor also recognizes a synthetic glycoprotein that has been developed as a radiopharmaceutical, technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA). This report describes the correlation between receptor parameters measured in vivo via kinetic modeling of 99mTc-NGA and those measured by in vitro radioassay of biopsied liver tissue. Eleven patients with diffuse hepatic disease underwent percutaneous liver biopsy followed by a 99mTc-NGA functional imaging study. In vivo measurements of HBP quantity Ro and forward binding rate constant kb obtained from the kinetic analysis of 99mTc-NGA liver and blood time-activity data were compared to total receptor quantity and the HBP-99mTc-NGA association constant KA as measured by Scatchard binding assay of the biopsied tissue. The correlation coefficients between in vivo and in vitro measurements were 0.73 (df = 8, p = 0.015) and 0.98 (df = 8, p less than 0.01) for Ro and kb, respectively. The in vivo measurements of HBP biochemistry via kinetic analysis of the radiopharmaceutical time-activity data reflect the average concentration and affinity of the receptor. This study further substantiates the validity of 99mTc-NGA as a quantitative probe for the HBP receptor. 
Abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment of the central nervous system may cause delayed neurotoxicity in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. We evaluated 12 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computed tomography scans, clinical neurological examinations, and neuropsychological tests. Regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlc) values for white matter were lower in the older long-term survivors (greater than 18 years old) treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy than in normal control subjects or survivors who had been treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. The ratio of white matter: cortex rCMRGlc values was lower than control values in the long-term survivors treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy, regardless of age, but not in those treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. By contrast, thalamic rCMRGlc values were lower than control values in older survivors regardless of treatment, and the ratio for thalamus:cortex rCMRGlc values was lower in all the treatment groups than in the control subjects. The highest rCMRGlc values were found in the youngest children, indicating an important effect of age on cerebral glucose metabolism. No neuropsychological deficits were identified in patients treated only with intrathecal chemotherapy; however, lower IQ scores were found in the long-term survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy. Treatment of the central nervous system with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy may cause prolonged alterations in white-matter and thalamic rCMRGlc, which may permit the identification and assessment of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. 
Effect of cyclosporine and steroids on canine bile flow. Cyclosporine and hydrocortisone are the main immunosuppressants used in transplant surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intravenous administration of cyclosporine and hydrocortisone on bile flow in dogs. Cyclosporine in doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1 were administered along with 18 mumol/min intravenous sodium taurocholate to dogs with chronic biliary and gastric fistulas. Bile volume and bile chloride concentration and output were increased by cyclosporine in a dose-related manner, whereas bile salt concentration decreased and bile salt output was unchanged. Hydrocortisone produced small but significant increases in bile flow only at the highest dose of hydrocortisone administered. Subsequently, experiments were performed when sodium taurocholate was administered in progressively increasing doses (9, 18 and 36 mumol/min), with the dose changed every hour. Bile volume, [14C]erythritol clearance in bile and bile salt concentrations were measured with and without cyclosporine and hydrocortisone administration. Cyclosporine increased the bile salt-independent fraction of canalicular bile flow and ductular bile flow. Experiments evaluating the role of the cyclosporine carrier polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) demonstrated that this substance had no independent choleretic activity, whereas cyclosporine dissolved in ethanol and administered without Cremophor EL significantly increased bile flow. The results of this study indicate that cyclosporine stimulates chloride-rich choleresis independent of bile salt secretion. 
Cavernomas of the central nervous system: clinical and neuroimaging manifestations in 47 patients. Forty seven cases of central nervous system cavernous angioma (21 males and 26 females) are described. The main clinical signs were epilepsy and brainstem syndromes. Digital subtraction intra-arterial angiography, when used, failed to reveal cavernoma. CT detected many of the lesions, but the most successful supplementary diagnostic procedure was MRI which produces highly characteristic images of cavernous angioma. The diagnosis of cavernous angioma was confirmed in the 18 cases in which the tumour was removed surgically. 
Nicardipine and vascular hypertrophy. The effects of nicardipine administration on the morphology of coronary, renal, and pulmonary vascular trees were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Male 10-week-old SHRs received 1 mg/kg/day of nicardipine or vehicle orally for 12 weeks. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive reference animals. Blood pressure, heart weight, heart/body weight ratio, the area occupied by the medial layer, and area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in SHRs compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Nicardipine reduced blood pressure, as well as relative heart weight, the area occupied by vascular smooth muscle, and the area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio. In addition, the size of laminae of smooth muscle of the pulmonary artery was reduced in nicardipine-treated SHRs; coronary artery branches were the most sensitive. The results of the study provide direct evidence that nicardipine reduces not only blood pressure but is also able to counteract the development of hypertension-dependent changes in the morphology of the cardiovascular system. 
Lung function in school-age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood. We examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness (LRI) experienced in early childhood and lung function in 89 boys and 70 girls 6 to 18 yr of age. The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice. Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing. In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years. Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness. The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study. Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant. Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history. Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children. 
Renal arteriolar diameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Vascular cast study. The relation between the arteriolar diameters and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis was studied by using microvascular casts and histological evaluation. Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes. Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group). In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26). The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36). These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure. 
An overview of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. This symposium reviewed the risk factors and problems associated with venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, especially those patients having total hip replacement. The importance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was emphasized by a theoretical analysis indicating that venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement not only saves lives but is also effective. A discussion of the pharmacology of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) included a review of its role, clinically and experimentally, in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Three of the discussants presented their favorable experiences with LMWH in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement. It can be concluded that LMWH does reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement without causing an increase in blood loss. If its effectiveness and safety remain substantiated, LMWH may soon become the preferred agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 
Nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap: repair of nasal supratip defects. The nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap ("nasalis flap") is an axial island flap based on the branch of the angular artery that supplies the nasalis muscle. The technique for performing this flap for the repair of defects up to 1.5 cm in diameter on the supratip area of the nose is described in detail. Twenty-four cases with supratip defects following Mohs surgery repaired with the nasalis flap are reported. Flap survival was 100% and final cosmetic results were excellent. It is concluded that the nasalis flap should always be considered for the repair of defects of the supratip area of the nose. 
Coronary vasospasm secondary to labetalol in a patient with aortic dissection. A 66-year-old hypertensive woman presented with epigastric and scapular pain on the basis of type 3 aortic dissection. Appropriate therapy with a combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic antagonist agent prevented further ongoing dissection and amelioration of symptoms. On day 5, an episode of coronary vasospasm occurred presumably due to beta-blockade with unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity. 
Cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma: a clinicopathological review of 14 cases with reference to antidesmin staining and nuclear DNA patterns studied by flow cytometry. Among 14 patients (11 female and three male) with cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcomas, metastatic spread occurred in six of the 13 patients with adequate follow-up. The tumours were classified with regard to tumour grade, number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields, reactivity to antidesmin antibodies, and DNA pattern as assessed by flow cytometry. Antidesmin antibody staining was present in only six cases and seemed to be less common in the higher-grade tumours. The DNA pattern was aneuploid in five cases and non-classifiable in one case; all of these cases had metastatic spread. None of the eight remaining diploid cases had metastatic spread. DNA content was a strong predictor of metastatic potential. 
Biochemical liver profile in hemochromatosis. A survey of 100 patients. To determine the frequency of liver profile abnormalities in hereditary hemochromatosis, we under took a retrospective survey in 100 patients, all of whom had undergone liver biopsy. Liver histology was compared with the biochemical profile, which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and albumin determinations. Mild abnormalities in the AST and ALT levels were seen in more than 65% of patients. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly greater elevations in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase, and a significant decrease in albumin (p less than 0.05). Proband cases had more frequent abnormalities than discovered cases within families. Accordingly, we find that mild abnormalities in the biochemical liver profile are common in hemochromatosis and suggest that patients with an unexplained abnormality in the liver profile should be screened for hemochromatosis with a serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. 
Petrosal sinus sampling with and without corticotropin-releasing hormone for the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome BACKGROUND. Measurement of adrenocorticotropin levels in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses of patients with Cushing's syndrome can distinguish adrenocorticotropin-secreting pituitary tumors (Cushing's disease) from other causes of the syndrome, principally ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion from an occult tumor. However, it is unknown whether such measurement consistently identifies patients with Cushing's disease and whether testing with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) enhances the value of the procedure. METHODS. We prospectively studied 281 patients with Cushing's syndrome to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the procedure. Bilateral sampling was successfully accomplished in 278 patients, with no major morbidity; 262 of these patients underwent sampling before and after administration of ovine CRH. The adrenocorticotropin levels in the samples were used to calculate the ratio of the concentration in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses to the concentration in peripheral-blood plasma (the IPS:P ratio). RESULTS. The diagnosis of 246 patients was confirmed surgically as Cushing's disease in 215, as ectopic adrenocorticotropin syndrome in 20, and as primary adrenal disease in 11. An IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 in basal samples identified 205 of the 215 patients with Cushing's disease (sensitivity, 95 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). A peak IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 3.0 after CRH administration identified all 203 of the patients with Cushing's disease who received CRH (sensitivity, 100 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). The sensitivity was much lower when the adrenocorticotropin concentrations in the samples from one sinus were considered alone. In patients with Cushing's disease a difference of greater than or equal to 1.4-fold between the concentrations in the two sinuses (the adrenocorticotropin gradient) predicted the location of the microadenoma in 68 percent of 104 patients during basal sampling and in 71 percent of 105 patients after CRH administration. CONCLUSIONS. Simultaneous bilateral sampling of plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses, with the adjunctive use of CRH, distinguishes patients with Cushing's disease from those with ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion with high diagnostic accuracy. 
HIV-1 infection complicated by food allergy and allergic gastroenteritis: a case report. A 34-year-old female with HIV-1 infection detected by positive serology in 1983 subsequently developed acute granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and angioedema associated with the ingestion of vanilla ice cream and tangerines. The enteritis and angioedema symptoms appeared to respond to large doses of oral sodium cromoglycate. Sera collected over several years before clinical symptoms revealed a sharp rise of IgE antibody in 1985 and a subsequent decline to baseline values followed by markedly increased levels of IgE antibodies to a number of inhalant and food allergens. The findings suggest disordered IgE antibody regulation as a consequence of HIV-1 infection and as a cause of allergic manifestations including eosinophilic gastroenteritis and food-induced angioedema. 
Hereditary angioneurotic edema in the puerperium. A case report. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is a potentially fatal condition. Below is described the first reported case of the initial presentation of the condition precipitated by vaginal delivery. 
Effect of beta-blockade on low heart rate-related ischemia during mental stress. To explore the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on low heart rate-related (mental stress) ischemia, 19 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, and underwent serial mental stress/bicycle exercise studies. Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +/- 16 vs. 123 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%). Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations. Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia. Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction. Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo. These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both. 
Coronary-subclavian steal: correction of recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms. Six months following aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularization using the left internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft, recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in our patient. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and a patent internal mammary artery graft with angiographic steal from the myocardium. The angina and cerebrovascular symptoms were relieved with correction of the proximal subclavian stenosis by balloon angioplasty. This demonstrates the importance of aortic arch and subclavian evaluation and selected angiography prior to myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft. 
Anterior mediastinal tumor of 30 years' duration. A 67-year-old woman had a large mediastinal mass with calcification. On roentgenogram of 30 years ago, the same mass without calcification was seen. The mediastinal mass was removed by surgery and proved to be a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), most probably as a transition from a giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease). 
Mass closure of the abdominal wound with delayed absorbable suture in surgery for gynecologic cancer. There has been a resurgence of interest recently in the optimal method of closure of the midline abdominal wound. The focus has been on the high-risk patient in particular. The controversy centers on interrupted versus continuous fascial closure and the choice of suture material. For three years on a gynecologic cancer service, running mass closure with delayed absorbable suture (Polyglactin) was used. Two hundred fifty-six patients were evaluable for analysis. The minimum follow-up time was two years. There was no wound dehiscence. Fourteen patients (5.5%) developed incisional hernias. The mass closure technique using delayed absorbable suture was effective in very-high-risk patients. 
Peritonsillar abscess: risk of disease in the remaining tonsil after unilateral tonsillectomy a chaud. The occurrence of disease in the remaining tonsil after unilateral tonsillectomy a chaud in the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, was studied in 536 patients. No patient had a history of previous severe tonsillitis at the time of the unilateral tonsillectomy, 6.1 per cent of the patients were readmitted for surgery of the remaining tonsil during the follow-up period. Ninety-seven per cent of these patients were younger than 30 years of age. Previous investigations have shown increasing frequency by age of pharyngitis after bilateral tonsillectomy. We suggest bilateral tonsillectomy in all cases of patients younger than 30 years old who suffer from peritonsillar abscess irrespective of previous tonsillar disease. Patients older than 30 should be treated with unilateral ablation, unless there is a clear indication for bilateral tonsillectomy. 
Anti-tumor effect of L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition with 5-fluorouracil administration on Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats. L-methionine-deprived total parenteral nutrition (methionine-deprived TPN), infusing amino acid solution devoid of L-methionine and L-cysteine by the method of TPN as an only protein source, showed enhancement of the effect of several anti-cancer agents. In this study the combined effect of the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined in Yoshida Sarcoma (YS)-bearing rats, from aspects of effects on the tumor metastasis and the host animal's life span, in the following four groups treated with: methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU, methionine-deprived TPN without administration of 5-FU, L-methionine-contained TPN plus 5-FU, and L-methionine-contained TPN without 5-FU. In the first experiment, TPN was continued for 8 days in the four groups, and the anti-cancer effect of methionine-deprived TPN and administration of 5-FU based on both the growth of the primary tumor at the implanted site and the tumor metastasis was studied from the view point of pathologic findings of animals killed immediately after these treatments. In experiment 2 the survival period was examined after these treatments for 10 days with subsequent oral feeding until death. The results were as follows: proliferation of YS, transplanted subcutaneously, was markedly suppressed; particularly hematogenous metastasis, characteristic in YS, was prominently blunted then obtained an apparent longer survival period in rats treated with the methionine-deprived TPN with administration of 5-FU. 
Remodeling of heart and arteries by chronic converting enzyme inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Hemodynamic and structural changes of the heart and large arterial vessels were studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats following 12 weeks administration of converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg daily by gavage). In both strains, a significant blood pressure reduction was observed. In normotensive rats, the hemodynamic changes involved significant increase in systemic arterial compliance whereas slight changes in left ventricular weight and aortic medial thickness were observed. In hypertensive rats, the increase in compliance was relatively small, whereas there was a major reduction in medial thickness. Furthermore, the reduction of the media thickness was much more pronounced than that of the left ventricular hypertrophy. The present results suggest that the cardiac and arterial changes observed following long term converting enzyme inhibition do not strictly parallel the blood pressure changes in hypertensive rats. Dissociation between cardiac and arterial changes may be observed. 
Cardiovascular and metabolic characteristics of hypertension. Hypertension is now seen as a broader condition than high blood pressure alone. Large-scale epidemiologic studies have established that high blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have shown an inconsistent reduction in major cardiovascular endpoints. Importantly, the incidence of coronary disease has been reduced to only a small extent, suggesting that factors beyond high blood pressure are important in the genesis of atherosclerotic disease in hypertensive patients. It is evident, for example, that patients with hypertension have an exaggerated vulnerability to the consequences of lipid abnormalities. Moreover, it has recently been established that hypertension is characterized by insulin resistance and altered glucose tolerance. As a result, high plasma concentrations of insulin produce proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and connective tissue, and they may adversely affect the lipid profile. The left ventricle is also involved in hypertension--independent of blood pressure. There is growing evidence that there are increases in the muscle mass of the left ventricle and changes in its diastolic filling characteristics at the very early stages of hypertension. The arterial circulation is similarly involved, for alterations in structure or function, reflected by diminished arterial compliance, can be demonstrated prior to the appearance of clinical hypertension. Treatment designed to protect hypertensive patients from cardiovascular events must not only be based on blood pressure, but must take into account all the components of the hypertension syndrome. 
Intraspinal neurothekeoma (nerve sheath myxoma). A report of two cases. Neurothekeomas (nerve sheath myxomas) are rare benign cutaneous tumors. The authors describe two spinal intradural cases that show histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features identical to their cutaneous counterparts. The authors' findings suggest histogenesis from Schwann's cells or undifferentiated nerve sheath precursor cells. Neurothekeomas in unusual locations should be differentiated from myxoid neurofibromas, perineuriomas, and soft tissue myxomas. 
A 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications. During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication. Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days. Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments. No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication. 
Segregation of atrial-specific and inducible expression of an atrial natriuretic factor transgene in an in vivo murine model of cardiac hypertrophy. To study the mechanisms that activate expression of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene during pressure-induced hypertrophy, we have developed and characterized an in vivo murine model of myocardial cell hypertrophy. We employed microsurgical techniques to produce a stable 35- to 45-mmHg pressure gradient across the thoracic aorta of the mouse that is associated with rapid and transient expression of an immediate-early gene program (c-fos/c-jun/junB/Egr-1/nur-77), an increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, and up-regulation of the endogenous ANF gene. These responses that are identical to those in cultured cell and other in vivo models of hypertrophy. To determine whether tissue-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, we used a transgenic mouse line in which 500 base pairs of the human ANF promoter region directs atrial-specific expression of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen), with no detectable expression in the ventricles. Thoracic aortic banding of these mice led to a 20-fold increase in the endogenous ANF mRNA in the ventricle but no detectable expression of the T-antigen marker gene. This result provides evidence that atrial-specific and inducible expression of the ANF gene can be segregated, suggesting that a distinct set of regulatory cis sequences may mediate the up-regulation of the ANF gene during in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy. This murine model demonstrates the utility of microsurgical techniques to study in vivo cardiac physiology in transgenic mice and should allow the application of genetic approaches to identify the mechanisms that activate ventricular expression of the ANF gene during in vivo hypertrophy. 
Combined use of nifedipine and diltiazem for the treatment of severe hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of drugs that have enhanced our ability to concurrently control blood pressure, treat coronary artery disease, and avoid many of the side effects of previously available antihypertensive agents. Patients with severe hypertension may require multiple agents for adequate control of blood pressure because of either poor control with one agent or side effects from high doses of a single agent. Laboratory investigations have shown a synergistic effect on receptor binding, as well as increased drug levels with the concurrent use of diltiazem and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (nifedipine or nicardipine). It is as yet unknown whether these effects on receptor binding and increased drug levels translate into greater clinical efficacy in blood pressure control. We have reported what we believe to be the first case in which this interaction was used successfully to control previously poorly controlled hypertension, while minimizing side effects. 
Epipodophyllotoxin-related leukemia. Identification of a new subset of secondary leukemia. Thirty-seven children and adults who developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after the administration of chemotherapy that included etoposide or teniposide for a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies were identified. The secondary leukemia that occurred in these patients could be distinguished from the secondary leukemia that occurs after treatment with alkylating agents by the following: a shorter latency period; a predominance of monocytic or myelomonocytic features; and frequent cytogenetic abnormalities involving 11q23. Patients receiving an epipodophyllotoxin are at risk for developing secondary leukemia that has features distinct from the syndrome of secondary leukemia associated with alkylating agents. 
Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis. Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an unusual syndrome in which a patient presents with a severe headache that may be associated with diverse neurologic and physical findings. The case of a 31-year-old woman with headache, vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and subsequent dense hemiplegia is presented. The patient was diagnosed as having a cerebral dural sinus thrombosis, but only after the diagnosis was missed initially. The syndrome may be difficult to detect because it can mimic several other entities. There are several known or suspected predisposing factors. The syndrome, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic options are reviewed. 
The course of lymphocytic hypophysitis. A 27-year-old woman presented to our institution in her seventh month of pregnancy with complaints of headache and visual field disturbance. Workup revealed bitemporal hemianopia, a markedly enlarged pituitary gland on computed tomography scan, and biochemical evidence of partial hypopituitarism. At surgery, a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland was taken revealing lymphocytic hypophysitis. The patient was treated with steroids and replacement doses of thyroid hormone. Visual fields improved postoperatively. A repeat computed tomography scan obtained 2 months after an uneventful pregnancy showed that her pituitary had regained normal size and contour. Over the next 9 months she had gradual recovery of all pituitary function. This case allowed us to follow and document the course of lymphocytic hypophysitis from its presentation as a macroadenoma with partial hypopituitarism to full recovery of both size and hormonal function of the pituitary. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass or pituitary dysfunction presenting in pregnancy. In patients with suspected lymphocytic hypophysitis and a pituitary mass, a trial of steroids may be therapeutic. 
Hepatocellular expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 in chronic hepatitis. T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic immune reactions are considered a major cause of hepatocyte injury in chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. To further investigate local immune responses, we studied the expression of lymphocyte antigens and cell-cell interaction molecules known to be involved in effector-target cell interactions by light and electron microscopy in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. CD8+ lymphocytes were found to be the predominant population of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. In contrast, CD4+ cells constituted a comparably higher proportion of cells and were more numerous than CD8+ cells in chronic autoimmune hepatitis. In both viral and autoimmune hepatitis, a substantial portion of lymphocytes expressed activation antigens such as T11/3 (CD2R) and IL-2-R (CD25). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (CD58), which mediates lymphocyte adhesion and activation and is the natural ligand of the CD2/T11 lymphocyte surface receptor, could be demonstrated on endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Hepatocellular lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 expression in chronic hepatitis showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and had a positive correlation with the degree of inflammatory activity. These results suggest that effector-target interactions between hepatocytes and lymphocytes mediated by the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3/CD2 pathway play a role in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Possible functional consequences of this interaction include enhancement of antigen-specific immune reactions and antigen-independent mechanisms of T cell activation, which may contribute considerably to the degree of inflammatory activity and tissue damage in chronic hepatitis. 
The role of prolactin in autoimmune demyelination: suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by bromocriptine. Several lines of evidence suggest that the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin has a stimulatory role on immune function and that pharmacological suppression of prolactin secretion with the dopamine-agonist bromocriptine suppresses both humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the effects of prolactin-suppression on the course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in female Lewis rats. Initiation of continuous bromocriptine treatment before immunization reduced both the severity and incidence of clinical signs of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-immunized rats experienced a threefold rise in basal prolactin levels on day 4 after immunization and maintained elevated prolactin levels on day 10, before the onset of neurological signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Bromocriptine treatment reduced prolactin levels to those of sham-immunized rats. In vivo bromocriptine pretreatment inhibited splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro to the immunizing antigen and to concanavalin A. Moreover, bromocriptine therapy was protective when initiated 1 week after the initial immunization and was also effective in suppression of late disease. These results indicate that (1) prolactin levels are elevated after immunization and before the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, (2) bromocriptine inhibits both prolactin secretion and the severity of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and (3) inhibition is also present when treatment is begun after sensitization, suggesting an effect of prolactin on the effector limb of the immune response during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. 
Life expectancy of patients with chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders. This study determines, within the frame of current therapeutic possibilities, the impact of chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders on expected survival. The survival data for 1067 patients (454 with polycythemia vera, 247 with essential thrombocythemia, and 366 with idiopathic myelofibrosis) were collected from 38 Spanish institutions. The actuarial survival probability of each group of patients was compared with that of the age-matched and sex-matched control population. The survival of the patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia did not differ from that of the control population (P = 0.92 and, 0.22, respectively), whereas the survival of the patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis was strikingly reduced with respect to the control population (P = 0.0000000007). Thus, in terms of survival, current therapeutic procedures may be considered as quite satisfactory in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. On the other hand, due to poor survival of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, new therapeutic approaches for this condition are clearly needed. 
Identification and characterization of a low-affinity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor on primary and cultured human melanoma cells. Hematopoietic growth factor receptors are present on cells of normal nonhematopoietic tissues such as endothelium and placenta. We previously demonstrated functional human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors on small cell carcinoma of the lung cell lines, and others have reported that certain solid tumor cell lines respond to GM-CSF in clonogenic assays. In the current study, we examine human melanoma cell lines and fresh specimens of melanoma to determine whether they have functional GM-CSF receptors. Scatchard analyses of 125I-GM-CSF equilibrium binding to melanoma cell lines showed a mean of 542 +/- 67 sites per cell with a kd of 0.72 +/- 0.14 nmol/L. Cross-linking studies in the melanoma cell line, M14, showed a major GM-CSF receptor species of 84,000 daltons. Under the conditions tested, the M14 cells did not have a proliferative response to GM-CSF in vitro, nor was any induction of primary response genes detected by Northern analysis in response to GM-CSF. Studies to determine internal translocation of the receptor-ligand complex indicated less than 10% of the 125I-GM-CSF internalized was specifically bound to receptors. Primary melanoma cells from five surgical specimens had GM-CSF receptors; Scatchard analysis was performed on one sample, showing 555 sites/cell with a kd of 0.23 nmol/L. These results indicate that human tumor cells may express a low-affinity GM-CSF receptor protein that localizes to the cell surface and binds ligand, but lacks functional components or accessory factors needed to transduce a signal. 
Bacterial translocation induces procoagulant activity in tissue macrophages. A potential mechanism for end-organ dysfunction. The ability of bacterial translocation to induce cell-associated procoagulant activity was examined in a rodent model. Intestinal decontamination with streptomycin sulfate and bacitracin followed by oral feeding with a streptomycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli produced monoassociation of the gastrointestinal tract with this microorganism. Using this model, the rate of bacterial translocation at day 3 increased from 6% (1 of 17) to 90% (28 of 31). Cell-associated procoagulant activity was measured in the mononuclear cell population of mesenteric lymph nodes as well as portal and systemic blood and also in hepatic nonparenchymal cells. In monoassociated animals, the procoagulant activity of mesenteric lymph node mononuclear cells was significantly greater than in control animals at day 3 (210% +/- 28% vs 100% +/- 6%) but not at days 1 or 6. Procoagulant activity of hepatic nonparenchymal cells was elevated in monoassociated animals at days 3 and 6 compared with control animals. Both control and monoassociated animals remained well throughout the experiment. The histologic features of the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric nodes, and liver did not differ between groups. These studies provide evidence that bacterial translocation, in the absence of external stimuli, is able to induce cell activation at sites remote from the gastrointestinal tract and may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure. 
The bentiromide test using plasma p-aminobenzoic acid for diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency in young children. The effect of two different doses and a liquid meal. The bentiromide test was evaluated using plasma p-aminobenzoic acid as an indirect test of pancreatic insufficiency in young children between 2 months and 4 years of age. To determine the optimal test method, the following were examined: (a) the best dose of bentiromide (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg); (b) the optimal sampling time for plasma p-aminobenzoic acid; and (c) the effect of coadministration of a liquid meal. Sixty-nine children 91.6 +/- 1.0 years) were studied, including 34 controls with normal fat absorption and 35 patients (34 with cystic fibrosis) with fat maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency. Control and pancreatic insufficient subjects were studied in three age-matched groups: (a) low-dose bentiromide (15 mg/kg) with clear fluids; (b) high-dose bentiromide (30 mg/kg) with clear fluids; and (c) high-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal. Plasma p-aminobenzoic acid was determined at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes then hourly for 6 hours. The dose effect of bentiromide with clear liquids was evaluated. High-dose bentiromide best discriminated control and pancreatic insufficient subjects, due to a higher peak plasma p-aminobenzoic acid level in controls, but poor sensitivity and specificity remained. High-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal produced a delayed increase in plasma p-aminobenzoic acid in the control subjects probably caused by retarded gastric emptying. However, in the pancreatic insufficient subjects, use of a liquid meal resulted in significantly lower plasma p-aminobenzoic acid levels at all time points; plasma p-aminobenzoic acid at 2 and 3 hours completely discriminated between control and pancreatic insufficient patients. Evaluation of the data by area under the time-concentration curve failed to improve test results. In conclusion, the bentiromide test is a simple, clinically useful means of detecting pancreatic insufficiency in young children, but a higher dose administered with a liquid meal is recommended. 
Tube feeding-related diarrhea in acutely Ill patients. Acutely ill patients received tube feeding for an average of 15.8 days and, on average, 35% of those days were spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were prospectively assigned either a fiber-free formula (FFF-OSMOLITE HN, Ross; n = 50) or a fiber-supplemented (soy polysaccharide 14.4 g/L) formula (FSF = JEVITY, Ross; n = 50). Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose or watery stools per day and occurred in 30% of all patients. Diarrhea developed in 29 (41%) of the 71 patients who received antibiotics during, or within 2 weeks prior to, the feeding period, whereas only 1 (3%) of the 29 patients not receiving antibiotics developed diarrhea (p less than 0.005); and this patient developed diarrhea on the day of death. Among the 30 patients with diarrhea, stool Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin was positive in 15 (50%), negative in 11 (37%), and was not measured in four. The mean serum albumin was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea (2.43) than in those without diarrhea (2.75) (p = 0.043). There were no significant differences in age, sex, diagnoses, number of feeding days, and percent ICU days between patients with and without diarrhea. While not statistically significant, patients who received FSF were observed to have a lower incidence of diarrhea, a lower percentage of diarrhea days per total feeding days, and a lower frequency of positive CD toxin assays than patients who received FFF. In this patient population, antibiotic usage was the factor most strongly associated with diarrhea during tube feedings. 
The choice between surgical resection and radiation therapy for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia: a retrospective comparison between two treatments. The choice of treatment for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia is controversial. Since overall survival is poor, the most important aim of treatment should be improvement of the main complaint: the inability to eat. In a retrospective analysis of 265 patients, referred to the University Hospital in Leiden, The Netherlands, comparisons were made between palliative effects of surgical resection (N = 92) and irradiation (N = 128). Several methods of comparing surgery with irradiation are possible: (1) all surgical patients vs. all irradiated patients; (2) only those surgical patients who survived the operation (N = 70) vs. all irradiated patients (N = 128); and (3) survivors after resection (N = 70) vs. only those irradiated patients treated with "curative" radiation (N = 62). Analysis of prognostic factors showed that in both surgical and irradiated patients, the only statistically significant factor was the (dis)ability to eat. Criteria to be considered to make individual recommendations for either treatment are presented. 
Expression of immunoreactive E-cadherin adhesion molecules in human cancers. E-cadherin (E-CD), a Ca(2+)-dependent adhesion molecule, plays a major role in the maintenance of intercellular junctions in normal epithelial cells in most organs. The expression of E-CD in human carcinoma samples (esophagus, stomach, and breast) was investigated using immunohistochemical staining, which was performed on surgical specimens using a monoclonal antibody for human E-CD. E-cadherin was strongly expressed in all normal epithelium examined. However E-CD expression in primary tumors of esophagus (11 of 15: 73%), stomach (5 of 20: 25%), and breast (9 of 20: 45%) was reduced, and 68% of these (esophagus: 8 of 11, stomach: 4 of 5, breast: 5 of 9) displayed heterogeneous E-CD expression. In some tumor cells with reduced E-CD expression, E-CD molecules were located in the cell cytoplasm. These results indicate that there are human cancer cells in which E-CD-related intercellular adhesion is impaired. 
Value of transesophageal echocardiography as an adjunct to transthoracic echocardiography in evaluation of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis. To determine if transesophageal echocardiography provides better visualization of valvular vegetations than transthoracic echocardiography, we used both methods to evaluate 24 consecutive patients (mean age, 54 years; 15 female patients and nine male patients) referred for symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Ten of the 24 patients had one or more valvular prostheses. Echocardiograms were classified as positive or negative based on visualization of valvular vegetations or abscesses. Of ten patients with a final diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on extended follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography was positive in five patients. Transesophageal echocardiography not only yielded abnormal findings in all ten of these patients, but also revealed additional information in four of the five patients with abnormal transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. Among the 14 patients who, on subsequent follow-up, were found not to have infectious endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography was normal in 13 and falsely abnormal in one. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infectious endocarditis in any of these patients. The ten patients who were determined to have infectious endocarditis all had positive blood cultures and no alternative cause for their clinical presentation; in seven patients in this group who underwent operative or postmortem evaluation, infectious endocarditis was confirmed. All patients without infectious endocarditis were demonstrated to have other causes for their clinical presentation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly valuable test in the work-up of patients with suspected infectious endocarditis, especially those patients with inconclusive or normal transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography may be of benefit to patients with previously documented infectious endocarditis and a complicated clinical course in whom additional cardiac lesions are suspected but not demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography. 
Long-term efficacy of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty. The role of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty (RALT) in the management of open-angle glaucoma is controversial. To determine the long-term efficacy of RALT, the authors reviewed case records of 44 patients (50 eyes) who received RALT for uncontrolled glaucoma at the Wills Eye Hospital before 1986. Success was defined as a 3 mmHg or greater decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) to less than 22 mmHg, and no further surgical intervention. By life table analysis, RALT was successful in 35% of eyes at 6 months, in 21% at 12 months, in 11% at 24 months, and in 5% at 48 months. Thirty-three percent of eyes in which primary ALT was successful for 1 year were successful 12 months after RALT. Complications included IOP spikes in 12%. In conclusion, RALT was generally not effective for long-term control of open-angle glaucoma, but may be useful as a temporizing measure. However, this use of RALT must be weighed against the risks of complications and the additional progression of disease before more definitive surgical intervention. 
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes as agonist-dependent oncogenes. We have evaluated the muscarinic acetylcholine family of G protein-coupled receptors (mAChRs) for their oncogenic potential. These receptors are preferentially expressed in postmitotic cells, transducing signals specified by their endogenous agonist, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Cells transfected with individual human mAChR genes were morphologically indistinguishable from parental NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of agonist. In contrast, when cultures were supplemented with carbachol, a stable analog of acetylcholine, foci of transformation readily appeared in m1, m3, or m5 but not in m2 or m4 mAChRs transfectants. Receptor expression was verified by ligand binding and was similar for each transfected culture. Transformation was dose-dependent and required only low levels of receptor expression. In transformation-competent cells, agonist induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, whereas in m2 or m4 transfectants, receptors were coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. These findings demonstrate that mAChRs linked to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis can act as conditional oncogenes when expressed in cells capable of proliferation. 
Odor identification deficit of the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam: equivalence to that of Alzheimer's and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate. 
Insulin acutely suppresses parathyroid hormone second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 osteoblast-like cells: differential effects on phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase activation. Insulin modifies the effects of PTH on osteoblast-like cells. However, the basis for this effect is unknown. In bone and kidney cells, the effects of PTH on cellular function are mediated by second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems. Therefore, we examined the effects of insulin on PTH second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. PTH produced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which was maximal at 30 sec and was only minimally reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium. Inositol-triphosphate (IP3) production was increased in parallel. PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i was concentration-dependent from 0.5-1,000 nM, with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 50 nM PTH. A 30-sec exposure to 50 nM PTH produced 32% and 23% increases in IP1 and IP3 production, respectively (both P less than 0.05). Although insulin alone did not significantly alter basal [Ca2+]i, a 1-min exposure to 1-100 nM insulin produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the PTH-stimulated transient increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 generation. 100 nM insulin decreased 50 nM PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i and IP3 levels by 84% (P less than 0.02) and 80% (P less than 0.001), respectively. Preexposure to insulin also decreased PTH stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels, but to a lesser degree. A 1-min exposure to 100 nM insulin produced a 32% (P less than 0.01) decrease in PTH-stimulated cAMP generation, but lower insulin concentrations were without significant effects. These results demonstrate that in UMR-106-01 cells, insulin suppresses PTH stimulation of second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems, but has a more marked effect on the former. 
Infected intravenous port device causing tricuspid valve regurgitation. Sepsis and tricuspid valve regurgitation developed in a 29-year-old man with Crohn's disease after implantation of an intravenous port device for parenteral nutrition. A thrombus, caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, had grown along the catheter and prolapsed through the valve without affecting it. Complete removal in an open heart procedure led to quick recovery. 
"Heartstart Scotland"--initial experience of a national scheme for out of hospital defibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome of out of hospital defibrillation in Scotland during the year after the introduction of automated external defibrillators in October 1988. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances. 
Quantitative analysis of the bacterial findings in otitis media. Qualitative and quantitative bacterial analysis of 200 samples of middle ear effusions collected from patients with current otitis media was performed. When middle ear pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis) were found during current acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion infection, the quantity of these bacteria was of the magnitude 10(6)-10(8)/ml and 0-5 x 10(5)/ml effusion material, respectively. Mucopurulent effusion material contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml whereas effusion from chronically discharging ears exceeded 10(9) bacteria per ml. Serous effusions did not harbour middle ear pathogens. The appearance of the effusion material was dependent on the number of bacteria involved. Quantification of bacteria in various middle ear effusions offers opportunities to make the diagnosis of various otitis media infections more accurate and readily comparable. 
Algorithm to predict triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease in patients without myocardial infarction. An international cross validation. Logistic regression was applied to the clinical, risk factor, and exercise data of consecutive angiographic referrals without prior myocardial infarction to determine an algorithm predicting the probability of triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease. These data were obtained from a total of 1,074 such subjects from patient populations at four centers (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio; Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest, Hungary; the university hospitals, Zurich and Basel, Switzerland; and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, Calif.) and used to derive four separate probability algorithms. Each algorithm is based on patient data from study samples at three of the four centers and consists of 272 logistic functions, which are related to linear combinations of 13 variables (age, sex, type of chest pain, systolic blood pressure, resting electrocardiogram, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, achieved exercise work load, achieved heart rate, exercise-induced angina and hypotension, heart rate-adjusted resting ST depression, and exercise ST slope). The four algorithms were cross validated by testing them on the populations not involved in their derivation. The resulting probabilities in the four test groups were then compared with the angiographic findings of triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease. The discriminatory power of all the algorithms was fair to good (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68, 0.75, 0.82, 0.85) in the test groups. The algorithm did not significantly underestimate or overestimate disease probability except in one center (Long Beach). 
Rehabilitation in cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is the most frequent physical disability of childhood onset. Over the past four decades, prevalence has remained remarkably constant at 2 to 3 per 1,000 live births in industrialized countries. In this article I concentrate on the rehabilitation and outcome of patients with cerebral palsy. The epidemiologic, pathogenetic, and diagnostic aspects are highlighted briefly as they pertain to the planning and implementation of the rehabilitation process. 
Treatment of subungual hematomas with nail trephination: a prospective study. Subungual hematoma is a commonly encountered problem in the emergency department. We designed a prospective, observational study to determine if treatment of simple subungual hematomas (SUH) by nail trephination alone is without cosmetic or infectious complications. Over a 2-year study period, 48 patients met inclusion criteria. Radiographs of all digits were taken to detect distal phalangeal fracture and SUH size was measured. Nail trephination was performed using electrocautery, and all patients reported relief of pain after the procedure. Follow-up was achieved in 45 of 48 patients with a total of 47 SUH. Average follow-up period was 10.3 +/- 4.3 months. By patient history, average time for the nail to grow back was 4.0 +/- 2.6 months. No complications of infection, osteomyelitis, or major nail deformities occurred in any patients treated by nail trephination, regardless of SUH size or presence of fracture. In simple SUH, regardless of size, nail removal with suture repair of the nail bed, as suggested in previous studies, is unnecessary. 
Cavitation potential of mechanical heart valve prostheses. Just like technical check valves, the function of mechanical heart valve prostheses may presumably also lead to cavitation effects during valve closure. Due to the waterhammer effect, cavitation may primarily occur in the mitral position leading to high mechanical loading of the valve itself and of corpuscular blood elements. Ten different types of commercial mechanical heart valves were investigated in the mitral position of a pulsatile mock loop, to detect cavitation thresholds under physiologically similar conditions by cinematographic techniques. Almost all these valve prostheses show cavitation up to a ventricular pressure gradient of 5000 mmHg/s. The threshold depends on valve type and size and is sometimes within the physiological range below 2000 mmHg/s. Visible cavitation bubbles with a diameter of up to 1.8 mm and a collapse time of less than 0.1 ms suggest that vapour cavitation may play an important role for material and blood damage in mechanical heart valve prostheses. 
Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan International Study Group. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre studies were carried out to assess the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 1-3 mg and 1-8 mg sumatriptan, respectively, in the acute treatment of migraine. Data are presented from a total of 519 patients. In both studies, the primary endpoint of efficacy was a reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild or no headache. All doses of sumatriptan were significantly more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms, and the response appeared to be dose-related; an effective response to treatment was achieved within 30 min in 73% of patients treated with 6 mg sumatriptan and 80% of patients treated with 8 mg sumatriptan s.c., compared with 22% for placebo. Sumatriptan was well tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild and transient. The most frequent complaint was irritation and pain at the site of injection. No changes in laboratory values were noted and ECG readings were unaltered by treatment. On the basis of these results, the 6 mg subcutaneous dose has been selected for further evaluation in large-scale studies. 
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and life threatening chronic diarrhoea. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection is not generally thought to cause severe diarrhoea after the neonatal period. Patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children over the three years (1984-7) with diarrhoea and EPEC infection were reviewed. Clinical details, features of small intestinal mucosa, and treatment were recorded in those who developed chronic diarrhoea with failure to thrive. Twenty six children with EPEC required hospital admission for diarrhoea and six of these (23%) developed chronic diarrhoea. In contrast only two (5%) of 42 with other serogroups of E coli (p less than 0.01) and 28 (4%) of 764 children without EPEC admitted with acute diarrhoea developed chronic symptoms (p less than 0.01). EPEC serogroups detected in the stool of the six children with chronic diarrhoea were 0128 in three, 0114 in two, and 0119 in one. The patients' clinical characteristics were: previous good health, no significant immunodeficiency, age 4-10 months, foreign travel (three of six), severe life threatening secretory diarrhoea from 0.5 to 1.5 1 per day (four of six), small intestinal enteropathy (five of six) three of whom showed mucosal adherent, non-invasive E coli of the same serotype as that in the stool, in association with microvillous loss and pedestal formation. All were treated with hypoallergenic feeds, two with parenteral nutrition, and three with parenteral antibiotics. All eventually recovered. EPEC infection is a common treatable cause of life threatening chronic diarrhoea in infancy. 
The development of a Norwegian pain questionnaire. The study was undertaken to develop a multidimensional measuring instrument for pain in the Norwegian language. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was used as a model as it is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement in English speaking countries. A series of steps were taken to develop a Norwegian pain questionnaire: (1) words describing pain were derived from 95 subjects (patients, students and health personnel); (2) 10 subjects allocated pain descriptors into groups; (3) 36 college student validated the word groupings; (4) 72 patients graded the words contained in each group according to intensity; and (5) the reliability of group items was tested. The study demonstrated that there are many descriptors of pain in the Norwegian language. The final version of the Norwegian pain questionnaire consisted of 106 pain descriptors divided into 18 groups. Validity of the classifications as well as reliability of the words was demonstrated. The actual value of the Norwegian pain questionnaire as a measuring instrument has not yet been documented. 
Dysphoria in male alcoholics with a history of hallucinations. This paper examines severity of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, in chronic alcoholics with and without a history of hallucinations. We found a) alcoholics entering alcohol treatment who have experienced hallucinations during detoxification report higher levels of subjective depression than alcoholics who have never experienced hallucinations, b) the level of subjective depression in alcoholics with a history of hallucinations remains higher at the end of inpatient alcohol treatment than in alcoholics without hallucinations, and c) hallucination is the important variable; alcoholics with blackouts, seizures, and delirium tremens, do not experience higher levels of depression during detoxification. The reporting of a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms by alcoholics with a history of experiencing hallucinations during withdrawal suggests that in some alcoholics, there exists a vulnerability for mood abnormalities which includes a predisposition toward other abnormal mental phenomena such as perceptual distortions. 
The epinephrine-blood platelet connection with special reference to essential hypertension. About three decades ago it was shown by an aggregometer that epinephrine activated blood platelets, and it was proposed that platelets could be the link between stress and cardiovascular disease. During the past 10 years this hypothesis has been tested in clinical studies. It has been found that subjects with hypertension consistently have raised plasma catecholamine levels and in particular elevated epinephrine levels. Arterial but not venous epinephrine concentrations correlated with plasma concentrations of the platelet-release reaction marker beta-thromboglobulin (BTG). Plasma BTG is elevated in hypertensive patients, and psychological stress (i.e., hypertension labeling) stimulates plasma epinephrine and BTG. When a physiologic dose of epinephrine is infused into essential hypertensive patients, platelet counts, platelet size, and plasma BTG concentrations increase more than in normotensive subjects. Data suggest that there is a connection between psychological stress, plasma epinephrine levels, and platelet function, especially in patients with essential hypertension. 
The radiology of headache. The patient who presents with a severe and acute headache should be evaluated radiographically with CT. The key diagnosis to make in this situation is hemorrhage, either subarachnoid or intraparenchymal. Computed tomography is more sensitive to acute hemorrhage than is MRI. When the patient is stable, MRI frequently contributes information to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, because vascular malformations and certain parenchymal lesions have a characteristic appearance on MRI. Hydrocephalus may also present acutely and is easily seen on CT or MRI. In a patient may show WMF and atrophy. The patient with trigeminal neuropathy may demonstrate central or peripheral lesions. In temporomandibular joint dysfunction, conventional tomography and MRI are frequently used. Magnetic resonance imaging shows excellent detail of the disk and surrounding soft tissues, whereas tomography better demonstrates bony changes. When a history of trauma is present, MRI may show a subacute subdural hematoma. These collections are easily seen on MRI, even when isodense on CT. Evidence of old shear injury is also well seen on MRI. Finally, neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital, and idiopathic sources of headache may be demonstrated by either MRI or CT, depending on presentation. MRI will generally show superior characterization. 
Pelvic osteosarcoma. Resection, reconstruction, local control, and survival statistics. Nine patients with a malignant tumor in the periacetabular region of the pelvis were treated with a Type IIC resection and were reconstructed using a cementless, adaptable prosthetic system. In two patients, a new planning strategy was applied using three-dimensional reconstruction. There were two chondrosarcomas, three Ewing-sarcomas, two osteosarcomas, and two metastases of thyroid cancer. Excision was wide, marginal, and intralesional in three cases each. Ages ranged from eight to 68 years (average, 40 years), and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months with an average of 27 months. Overall functional evaluation was good in five cases, fair in three, and poor in one. Four patients died of local recurrences and lung metastases; all of them had marginal or intralesional resections. Histologic analysis of one retrieved specimen revealed bone ingrowth with connective tissue interface. Three-dimensional planning has proven to be a very valuable tool for achieving an anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring. These results are encouraging and endorse the authors to continue with the current approach of prosthetic reconstruction following Type IIC resections. 
Pulmonary embolism update. Lessons for the '90s. Pulmonary embolism continues to be an underdiagnosed, potentially fatal problem. Because clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is notoriously inaccurate, clinical suspicions must always be confirmed with objective studies. Evaluation generally begins with ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. Further evaluation is usually unnecessary if the lung scan is interpreted as normal (diagnosis excluded) or high-probability (diagnosis accepted). However, if the lung scan is indeterminate (referring to all other interpretations), additional diagnostic studies are usually required. Newer trends in the management of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis include a more aggressive initial regimen of heparin; simultaneous administration of warfarin with heparin, resulting in a shorter duration of heparin therapy; use of the international normalized ratio to monitor warfarin therapy; and use of a less intense warfarin regimen. Adjusted-dose subcutaneous heparin therapy and low-intensity warfarin therapy are newer prophylactic techniques for patients at moderate to high risk for deep venous thrombosis. 
Early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes. Clinical, electrophysiological and MRI observations in comparison with Friedreich's ataxia. Fourteen patients with the clinical diagnosis of early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (EOCA) were examined and compared with 11 patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FA). The mean age of onset in EOCA was 15.9 +/- 6.0 yrs (FA: 14.0 +/- 5.7 yrs). Annual progression rate and the percentage of patients who were wheelchair-bound was lower in EOCA as compared with FA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. The latency until becoming wheelchair-bound, however, was significantly longer in EOCA than in FA. The segregation ratio in EOCA was significantly lower than 0.25. Clinically, EOCA and FA patients presented with a progressive cerebellar syndrome. Associated symptoms, such as muscle wasting, sensory disturbances, foot deformity, scoliosis and electrocardiographic abnormalities were encountered less frequently in EOCA than in FA patients. The electrophysiological findings in EOCA were variable and pointed to axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves and central pathways. Posturographic measurements revealed a higher incidence of anteroposterior sway direction in EOCA as compared with FA, suggesting a cerebellar type of ataxia in EOCA. Eleven out of the 14 EOCA patients had cerebellar atrophy in MRI. The characteristic MRI finding in FA was upper cervical cord shrinkage and only minor atrophy of the cerebellum. The demonstration of cerebellar atrophy in the majority of EOCA patients supports the view that EOCA is distinct from FA. It is uncertain, however, whether EOCA is a homogenous disease entity or a group of phenotypically similar syndromes. 
Fluconazole therapy for chronic disseminated candidiasis in patients with leukemia and prior amphotericin B therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of fluconazole against chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis) in patients with leukemia in whom amphotericin B treatment had failed. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole is a safe and effective agent with significant activity against chronic disseminated candidiasis. 
Treatment of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm with botulinum A toxin: a Canadian multicentre study. Botulinum A exotoxin was recently approved for use in Canada. We describe the efficacy of botulinum toxin in the management of 235 patients with blepharospasm (mean age 64.3 years) and 130 patients with hemifacial spasm (mean age 60.4 years) treated at three Canadian ophthalmologic centres between 1984 and 1989. A total of 98% of the patients with blepharospasm and 100% of the patients with hemifacial spasm had significant relief of their symptoms; however, 11% of the former and 2% of the latter did not respond to the usual starting concentrations of the drug and needed stronger dosages for relief. The duration of relief varied widely in both groups. Up to 7% of patients had ineffective treatments but responded to subsequent injections. Analysis of variance and linear trend statistics showed that there were no changes in the mean duration of relief over the first several treatments for individual patients in either group. Side effects were transient and included ptosis, exposure keratitis, epiphora and strabismus. 
Achalasia: current evaluation and therapy. The current evaluation of and therapy for achalasia are reviewed. Esophageal manometry remains the best means for diagnosing achalasia. Initial therapy can include either pneumatic dilation or esophagomyotomy. Symptomatic improvement occurs in 71% of patients after pneumatic dilation, with a risk of perforation of 1.4%. Eight percent of these patients require subsequent esophagomyotomy. Surgical procedures for achalasia can be performed through either an abdominal or a thoracic incision. Nearly all authors favoring an abdominal approach add an antireflux operation to esophagomyotomy, whereas many authors advocating a transthoracic esophagomyotomy believe that an antireflux wrap is unnecessary. Overall results for the various surgical approaches used as initial therapy are excellent, with symptomatic improvement in 89% of patients, a mortality rate of less than 1%, and development of gastroesophageal acid reflux in less than 10%. Factors governing the choice of initial therapy are discussed. 
Partial-thickness wedge and advancement flap for upper lip repair Reconstruction of upper lip defects demands careful attention in order to reconstitute both normal function and normal appearance. These defects may involve mucosa, orbicularis oris muscle, skin, vermilion, or any combination of these structures. We will describe five cases in which there were defects created by Mohs micrographic surgery and present the concept of partial-thickness wedge in combination with a flap to repair these wounds. 
Acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis. In a series of 88 patients with acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis, 26 (30%) required emergency therapeutic intervention because of septicemic shock (n = 15), persistent fever (n = 8), or spreading peritonitis (n = 3). Analysis was made to define factors that predisposed to failure of conservative treatment and characteristics that could predict the need for emergency biliary decompression. The age, incidence of concomitant medical diseases, previous biliary surgery, positive blood culture, bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics used, and multiplicity of bacterial strains in bile cultures in patients who required emergency intervention were similar to these factors in patients who had elective operations after successful conservative management. The incidence of intrahepatic segmental obstruction by stones or strictures was similar, but many more patients who required emergency intervention had concomitant extrahepatic obstruction due to impacted common ductal stones or strictures. Logistic regression analysis of clinical, hematological, and biochemical data showed that maximum pulse rate within 24 hours of presentation (greater than 100 beats per minute, relative risk, 2.8) and platelet count at the time of admission (less than 150 x 10(9)/L, relative risk, 5.2) were the factors with independent significance in predicting the need for emergency therapeutic procedures. This finding may serve as a guideline for identifying high-risk patients for early intervention. 
Narrow duct segment distal to choledochal cyst. "Narrow segments" (or stenotic portions) of the common bile duct (CBD) distal to cysts in two patients (a 50-yr-old woman and a 25-yr-old man) with choledochal cyst (CholCyst) were studied macroscopically and histologically. The narrow segments of the ducts were patent and connected with the main pancreatic duct extraduodenally, whereas the CBD in controls were neither dilated nor stenotic, and joined the main pancreatic duct within the duodenal wall. These narrow segments were 1 cm long. In case 1, a minute orifice was found in the narrow segment of the duct macroscopically and was identified microscopically as a small duct from a pancreatic lobule. In case 2, a small pancreatic duct also joined the narrow segment of the duct. These small pancreatic ducts were derived from the ventral pancreas, based on distribution of PP-islets. Therefore, the narrow duct distal to the cyst in patients with CholCyst (or congenital biliary dilatation) was considered to be a branch of the ventral pancreatic duct. 
Prenatal diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses. This article reviews the application of genetic linkage analysis to molecular prenatal diagnosis using the neurofibromatoses as an example. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for these diseases are reviewed first, followed by a brief description of the principles underlying genetic linkage analysis, the detection of DNA polymorphisms and their application to the cloning of the NF1 gene. The last two sections review the molecular diagnosis and some of the problems in prenatal genetic counseling for NF1. 
Waking and rising at night as a trigger of myocardial ischemia. A diurnal pattern of changes in transient myocardial ischemia has been well documented in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increase in the early morning hours. To further investigate potential triggers of ischemia, certain defined and distinct episodes of waking and rising during the nighttime were examined. Of 113 patients who underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, 466 episodes of ischemia lasting 3,926 minutes were detected in 67 of the patients. In 30 patients who had ischemia at night, 21 reported 36 occasions of waking and rising, and 67% of these events were associated with ST-segment depression. Frequency and duration of ischemia were similar in the nocturnal episodes versus the early morning episodes of ischemia as were the increases in heart rate at 30, 10, 5 and 1 minute before the onset. Even before waking, there was an increase in heart rate beginning approximately 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. This increase became significant 5 minutes before onset both in the early morning and on rising at night. Patients with nocturnal ischemia had significantly worse clinical signs of CAD. This study shows that rising at night is often associated with episodes of myocardial ischemia and, like the morning events on rising, is likely an important trigger of ischemia in patients with CAD. 
Treatment of compound fractures. Management of compound fractures remains a challenge to the surgeon. Methods to decrease patient morbidity include early fracture stabilization and sequential debridement. External fixation remains the standard; however, early internal fixation in low-grade injuries may be an acceptable option. Early soft tissue coverage is critical. The use of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics has decreased the incidence of acute infection and chronic osteomyelitis. Supplemental use of local antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads appears to further diminish the morbidity in high-grade open fractures. 
Chronic osteomyelitis due to Clostridium clostridiiforme. We have reported a case of chronic osteomyelitis due to an unusual anaerobic organism, Clostridium clostridiiforme, a gram-positive rod that often stains gram-negative and that is frequently resistant to such drugs as cefoxitin and clindamycin. Clostridia other than those similar to C perfringens are generally not considered invasive pathogens, but our case and several similar ones show that they can be. 
Long-term results and patterns of disease recurrence after radical operations for lung cancer. Long-term results and patterns of disease recurrences after radical operations for lung cancer between 1975 and 1984 were investigated. Eight hundred fifty-two patients (76.1%) with lung cancer underwent operations during this period. Radical operations were performed on 648 patients. There were 326 (50.6%) pneumonectomies, 314 (48.5%) lung resections (lobectomies), and 8 (1.2%) segmentectomies. Long-term survival rates of 542 patients were studied. In 49.2% of the patients survival was beyond 3 years; in 33% of the patients it was beyond 5 years. Five-year survival was observed in 40.3% +/- 2.5% of patients with N1 and in 19% +/- 4.9% of patients with N2 disease. The differences in survival rates between patients with epidermoid cancer and adenocarcinoma were slight and statistically insignificant. The prognosis was poor in patients with small-cell cancer, large-cell cancer, and dimorphous cancer. The causes of death were studied in 193 patients. Disease recurrence was diagnosed in 75.1% of cases. Bronchopulmonary and concomitant diseases accounted for 19.7% of deaths in these patients. In 5.2% of the patients malignant tumors occurred in other organs. Local-regional recurrences were diagnosed in 33.8% of patients, distant metastases occurred in 55.2% of patients, and 11% of patients had combined disease recurrences. The problem of disease recurrence classification is discussed in the article. 
Left flank retroperitoneal exposure: a technical aid to complex aortic reconstruction. Over the last 5 years an extended left flank retroperitoneal approach was used in 85 of 531 (16%) aortic reconstructions deemed technically complex. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a "hostile" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges. 
Brachial approach to emergency cardiac catheterization during thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. The use of the brachial approach to acute coronary intervention has not been previously studied. In the course of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials, we used the transbrachial approach to cardiac catheterization with or without angioplasty in 202 of 704 (28.6%) patients. The baseline characteristics of age, sex, risk factors, medical history, time from symptom onset to therapy, and left ventricular function were similar for the 2 different approaches. Time from therapy to coronary angiography was not delayed by the brachial approach compared with the femoral approach: 97.1 +/- 26 min vs. 99.9 +/- 133.8 min, respectively. Chemical patency was established in 78 vs. 73% of patients and technical success with acute PTCA with the brachial approach was 89% vs. 78% with the femoral approach. Clinical outcomes were quite similar with respect to death (6 vs. 6%), reocclusion (10 vs. 14%), and emergency coronary bypass surgery (5 vs. 6%). Baseline hematocrit was 43.9 +/- 4.4 and 43.5 +/- 4.8, respectively with a nadir of 32.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 33.0 +/- 5.4. The need for vascular repair occurred in 1% vs. 3% of patients and retroperitoneal hemorrhage was documented in 1% vs. 1% of patients. This study indicates that in the hands of experienced operators the transbrachial approach to acute coronary intervention in the acute phase of treatment with thrombolytic therapy can be used with equal risks and efficacy as the femoral approach. 
Selection criteria for successful immediate breast reconstruction. To evaluate the factors leading to success in immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, 176 consecutive immediate reconstructions done with implants or expanders over a 5-year period were analyzed. None of these 176 had "complete muscle coverage." There were only five failures: four with implant loss (one involving radiation) and one removed electively. The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders. There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants. Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed. It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of "complete muscle coverage." It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection. Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed. 
Fragile X syndrome: diagnosis using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. We describe two highly polymorphic microsatellite AC repeat sequences, VK23AC and VK14AC, which are closely linked to the fragile X at Xq27.3. Both VK23AC (DXS297) and VK14AC (DXS292) are proximal to the fragile site. Two-point linkage analysis in 31 fragile X families gave (a) a recombination frequency of 1% (range 0.00%-4%) with a maximum lod score of 32.04 for DXS297 and (b) a recombination frequency of 7% (range of 3%-15%) with a maximum lod score of 12.87 for DXS292. Both of these polymorphisms are applicable to diagnosis by linkage in families with fragile X syndrome. A multipoint linkage map of genetic markers at Xq27.3 was constructed from genotyping these polymorphisms in the CEPH pedigrees. The DXS292 marker is in the DXS98-DXS297 interval and in 3 cM proximal to DXS297. 
Gastrointestinal mucosal injury in experimental models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mucosa of the GI tract serves as an important barrier limiting the systemic absorption of luminal microbes and microbial products. Two methods commonly used to assess the integrity of the GI mucosal barrier are assessment of the extent of microbial translocation and measurement of mucosal permeability to hydrophilic probes. RESULTS: Studies using these methods have provided convincing evidence that the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa is deranged in numerous animal models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying mucosal injury under these circumstances remain incompletely understood, current evidence suggests that mucosal damage in shock, trauma, and sepsis is likely due to various combinations of intracellular hypoxia due to ischemia, tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen metabolites, the deleterious effects of various lipid mediators (e.g., platelet-activating factor) and/or cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), and deficient utilization or supply of key nutritional substrates (e.g., glutamine). 
Grading of human urothelial carcinoma based on nuclear atypia and mitotic frequency. II. Prognostic importance. A grading system was applied in a retrospective study of 124 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder using a modified Bergkvist system. The intermediate World Health Organization (WHO) grade II tumors were divided into supposedly benign and malignant forms of grades IIa and IIb, respectively. The 5-year survival was 92% for patients with grade IIa urothelial carcinoma, compared to 43% for patients with grade IIb tumors. The corresponding figures for grades I and III tumors were 100 and 44%, respectively. When excluding carcinoma in situ (5-year survival 50%) no patient with a noninvasive tumor (stage Ta) died of bladder carcinoma within 5 years, compared to 50% of those with invasive cancers (stages T1 to T4). We propose a new grading system in which grades I and IIa are embraced as grade A, grades IIb and III as grade B, and grade IV as grade C. The 5-year survival rate in the 3 grades was 94, 44 and 27%, respectively. Grade A seems to represent a type of tumor with universally favorable prognosis, in contrast to grades B and C. This offers practical advantages, since the former can be treated conservatively, whereas the latter need more urgent radical intervention, especially in patients in whom invasive growth is recorded. 
Expression of c-jun during macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cellular transcription factors are important in the regulation of cellular genes. Recent studies have indicated that a class of cellular genes known as early response genes are important in the control of cellular growth properties. Two of these genes, c-jun and c-fos, play an important role in the control of cellular differentiation. Because the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60, is capable of differentiating to either macrophages or granulocytes, it provides a good model to understand differential gene expression. To determine if the modulation of c-jun was important in the differentiation of HL-60 cells to either macrophages or granulocytes, expression of c-jun mRNA was determined by Northern analysis at various times following treatment with a variety of differentiating agents, including 12-tetradeconyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25 (OH)2 D3]. Both TPA and 1,25(OH)2D3, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophages, resulted in marked increases in c-jun mRNA; while RA and DMSO, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to granulocytes, did not greatly alter c-jun mRNA expression. HL-60 cell lines resistant to macrophage differentiation after exposure to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA did not result in increases in c-jun mRNA. These results suggest that elevation of c-jun mRNA in HL-60 cells correlated temporally with differentiation to macrophages. Thus, c-jun may be a critical cellular transcription factor involved in macrophage differentiation. 
Presence of the terminal complement complex (C5b-9) precedes myelin degradation in immune-mediated demyelination of the rat peripheral nervous system. In this study, the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (TCC) was localized by immunocytochemistry at different clinical stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Deposits of TCC were found on the surface of Schwann cells and their myelin sheaths, and to some extent in the extracellular space at predilective sites of impending demyelination before onset of clinical signs and for a short period thereafter. Additionally, TCC was deposited on the surface of W3/13 positive leukocytes. No TCC immunoreactivity was seen in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerves 1 to 15 days after axotomy. The early and transient deposition of TCC on Schwann cells and myelin sheaths in experimental autoimmune neuritis before overt demyelination suggests that complement activation plays a pathogenic role in the initiation of immune-mediated myelin damage. The lack of TCC immunoreactivity after nerve transection excludes a nonspecific activation process. The signals involved in local TCC formation in demyelinating peripheral nervous system disorders have yet to be explored. 
Results of Medical Research Council phase II study of low dose cisplatin and methotrexate in the primary treatment of locally advanced (T3 and T4) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. A series of 49 previously untreated patients with category T3 or T4 bladder cancer underwent treatment with low dose methotrexate and cisplatin; 44 patients were eligible for assessment of response. Complete response (CR) was seen in 5 patients (11%) and partial response in 15 (34%) (overall response rate 45%). Treatment was reasonably well tolerated with no major morbidity and no treatment-related deaths. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 70 and 30% respectively. Ten patients remain recurrence-free without having received "definitive local therapy" (cystectomy and/or radiotherapy) at follow-up extending from 20 to 50 months. 
Aspirin in the prevention of thrombosis. More than a decade has passed since the introduction of the concept that inhibition of platelet function may be helpful in preventing the initiation of thrombus formation. Aspirin has been recognized as inhibiting normal platelet function and the mechanism has been clearly delineated. Legions of patients have been studied to answer the question of whether aspirin is efficacious in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. At the present time, however, a solid, clear answer is not available and firm recommendations cannot be made. A large number of studies evaluating aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in the prevention or delay of recurrent myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) have been completed and those studies reporting a favorable beneficial effect are in the minority. In these secondary prevention studies reporting success, the doses of aspirin employed were large enough to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase system and thromboxane A2 production as well as the synthesis of prostacyclin. Thus, in these studies if aspirin is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events, its efficacy is being mediated by an unknown mechanism. If the reader of the few studies that report positive results is convinced of the benefit of aspirin, it must be emphasized that thoughtful, cautious patient selection based upon the individual's cardiovascular risk profile must be exercised. Individual variation may exist with respect to aspirin's beneficial effect. It must be absolutely recognized that aspirin or any antiplatelet agent does not in any way substitute for the removal or treatment of coexisting risk factors such as tobacco, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic disease. In contrast to aspirin, control of the above risk factors has been established as beneficial. Aspirin is not free of undesirable side-effects; fatalities secondary to hemorrhage have been reported, and these must be known in detail and understood by both physician and patient before this agent is prescribed in the prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
Limb salvage for osteosarcoma in the 1980s. The incidence of local recurrences following limb salvage performed by experienced surgeons with wide surgical margins and with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is sufficiently low (5%-10%) so as not to have a biologically statistically significant impact on the long-term survival rate. Following limb salvage, the incidence of morbidity increases with a few patients occasionally requiring prolonged or repeated hospitalizations and further surgical procedures, even amputation. The durability of the reconstructions is variable, and many of the mobile knee reconstructions may need to be revised if the patients become long-term survivors. The function of salvaged limbs is better than that after the alternative amputation, but none of the reconstructions will give normal function. Finally, no matter which type of surgery on the lower extremity is selected, patients will have a good early psychosocial adjustment if no premorbid psychosocial disorder is present. 
Complement activation by artificial blood substitute Fluosol: in vitro and in vivo studies. A perfluorocarbon blood substitute, Fluosol, is undergoing clinical trials as an adjunct to chemotherapy. The adverse effects associated with its administration have been postulated to result from complement activation. When gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of Fluosol are used after its incubation with serum, activated C3 and factors Bb and H are bound to the Fluosol particles in a time-dependent fashion, which suggests that complement activation with Fluosol, as does that with zymosan, occurs on the surface of the particles. Paradoxically, it is found, both by the measurement of Fluosol-bound C3d and by fluid-phase C5a, that lower concentrations of Fluosol cause greater amounts of complement activation, which suggests a complex interaction of activators and inhibitors that changes as the available surface area is decreased. Studies performed with bystander red cell-bound C3d demonstrated in vivo complement activation occurring in six patients receiving Fluosol as an adjunct to chemotherapy for colon cancer. In two patients, there was a marked increase in red cell-bound C3d after Fluosol infusion; these two patients also developed adverse reactions during Fluosol infusion. These studies suggest that the Fluosol surface plays a major role in the initiation and regulation of complement activation that is seen during Fluosol infusion. 
Early-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice. An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure. This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice. 
Epileptiform EEG activity of the centromedian thalamic nuclei in children with intractable generalized seizures of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Centromedian thalamic nuclei (CM) epileptiform EEG activities were recorded in children with intractable generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) through implanted recording-stimulating electrodes used for seizure control. Ictal CM epileptiform activities were consistently correlated to widespread surface cortical EEG activities and symptoms in all patients and all types of generalized seizures; i.e., fast spike discharges at CM correlated at onset of tonic and tonic-clonic generalized seizures; slow (1-2 Hz) spike-wave complex discharges at CM correlated for atypical absence seizures; slow polyspike-wave complex discharges correlated for myoclonic seizures; and spike bursts and suppression patterns correlated for combined tonic-atonic-myoclonic seizures. Ictal EEG activities occurred simultaneously at right and left CM and surface at onset of all seizure types, with the exception of myoclonic seizures where CM complete discharges and individual spike-wave complexes significantly lead those of the surface. Brief tonic-atonic spasms clinically undistinguishable from "real" epileptic seizures showed no EEG counterparts at CM and surface. Interictal CM spike-wave complete discharges and individual spike-wave complexes showed variable amplitude-temporal patterns. Amplitude emphasis on CM and frontopolar regions was observed in most of complete discharges, however, and phase shifts between CM and frontopolar regions were observed in individual spike-wave complexes. 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-induced myopathy in the rat: cyclosporine A interaction and mechanism studies. Recent clinical evidence indicates a potential for skeletal muscle toxicity after therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRIs) in man. Although the incidence of drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity is very low (0.1-0.2%) with monotherapy, it may increase following concomitant drug therapy with the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA), and possibly with certain other hypolipidemic agents. In the Sprague-Dawley rat, very high, pharmacologically comparable dosages (150-1200 mg/kg/day) of structurally similar HMGRIs (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and L-647, 318) produced dose-related increases in the incidence and severity of skeletal muscle degeneration. Physical signs included inappetence, decreased activity, loss of body weight, localized alopecia and mortality. To evaluate the interaction between HMGRIs and CsA, a rat model of CsA-induced cholestasis was developed. In this 2-week model, the skeletal muscle toxicity of the HMGRIs was clearly potentiated by CsA (10 mg/kg/day). Doses of HMGRIs which did not produce skeletal muscle toxicity when given alone caused between 75 and 100% incidence of myopathy (very slight to marked skeletal muscle degeneration) when CsA was coadministered. Typical light microscopic changes included myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltration in areas of acute injury. Histochemical characterization of the muscle lesion indicated that type 2B fibers (primarily glycolytic white fibers) were most sensitive to this toxicity but that, with prolonged administration, all fiber types were ultimately affected. Results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with various HMGRIs +/- CsA indicated that coadministration of CsA alters the disposition of these compounds, resulting in increased systemic exposure (e.g., increased area under the plasma drug concentration vs. time curve-AUC) and consequent (up to 13-fold) increases in skeletal muscle drug levels. Evaluation of the potential interaction between the HMGRI, lovastatin and CsA at the level of hepatic microsomal metabolism indicated that CsA did not inhibit the metabolism of lovastatin in isolated microsomes from female rats. In light of the above findings, it appears that HMGRI-induced myopathy is a class effect in the rat, which is potentiated by CsA as the result of altered clearance and resultant increased tissue exposure. Cholestasis associated with CsA and HMGRIs may form the basis for decreased elimination and the resultant elevated systemic exposure. Furthermore, this toxicity is muscle fiber-selective and may be associated with impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism. 
Age of onset in siblings concordant for multiple sclerosis. We have evaluated genetic and environmental influences in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing age of onset in 99 sibling pairs concordant for the disease. We used three methods of analysis: (1) comparison of mean differences in age of onset and year of onset, (2) linear regression of differences in age or year of onset vs difference in ages, and (3) intraclass correlation of age of onset which is also used for monozygotic twins concordant for MS. Comparison of the mean differences in age of onset or year of onset is found to be inappropriate and potentially misleading. No significant results were found in linear regression of the age of onset or year of onset vs differences in ages, although a trend towards onset at the same age is present. However, nontwin siblings show a significant intraclass correlation for age of onset (P less than 0.01) as is seen in genetic disorders. A stronger intraclass correlation in age of onset in concordant monozygotic twins vs concordant sibling pairs further suggests that age of onset is partly under genetic control, assuming common exposure to an environmental agent. The results give little support for common exposure to an environmental trigger in concordant MS sibling pairs. They are consistent with a mixture of random independent exposures and common exposures leading to the development of the disease, with the former predominating. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
A management plan for tongue base cancer that includes brachytherapy. For physiologic as well as oncologic reasons, there has been an increasing interest in radiation therapy as the primary treatment of base of tongue carcinoma. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, we have used such a plan, using external beam conventional therapy in combination with an interstitial boost of iridium 192 to the primary site, plus planned neck dissections in selected patients. Between 1981 and 1986, 17 patients with untreated base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma were treated in this manner. Thirteen of the 17 are disease-free as a result of this therapy. Two patients have failed locally, yielding an actuarial local control of 87% at a median followup of 2 years. These data would suggest that primary radiation that includes interstitial therapy as part of the plan, along with neck dissection in certain situations, is a worthwhile method management of base of tongue carcinoma. 
Pelvic osteosarcoma. Resection, reconstruction, local control, and survival statistics. Nine patients with a malignant tumor in the periacetabular region of the pelvis were treated with a Type IIC resection and were reconstructed using a cementless, adaptable prosthetic system. In two patients, a new planning strategy was applied using three-dimensional reconstruction. There were two chondrosarcomas, three Ewing-sarcomas, two osteosarcomas, and two metastases of thyroid cancer. Excision was wide, marginal, and intralesional in three cases each. Ages ranged from eight to 68 years (average, 40 years), and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months with an average of 27 months. Overall functional evaluation was good in five cases, fair in three, and poor in one. Four patients died of local recurrences and lung metastases; all of them had marginal or intralesional resections. Histologic analysis of one retrieved specimen revealed bone ingrowth with connective tissue interface. Three-dimensional planning has proven to be a very valuable tool for achieving an anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring. These results are encouraging and endorse the authors to continue with the current approach of prosthetic reconstruction following Type IIC resections. 
A double-blind comparison of low-dose intravenous ketamine and methohexital in adults. Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery. Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used. No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine. Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital. 
CNS pathology in the neurological mutant rats zitter, tremor and zitter-tremor double mutant (spontaneously epileptic rat, SER). Exaggeration of clinical and neuropathological phenotypes in SER. The pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) were examined in three kinds of mutant rat; the zitter (zi/zi; Zi), the tremor rat (tm/tm; Tm) and the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) which is a double mutant carrying both zitter and tremor genes. Two major alterations demonstrated in these mutants were hypomyelination and vacuolation or spongy degeneration. Hypomyelination was observed predominantly in SER and to a lesser extent in Zi, and was accompanied by a redundant or aberrant myelin sheath formation in addition to a decreased number of myelinated fibres. This appeared to be related to the occurrence of tremor. There was no abnormality in the structure of the myelin lamellae and oligodendrocytes or any destruction of myelin sheaths by phagocytic cells. The number of radial components in CNS myelin was increased almost equally in Zi, Tm and SER. Vacuolation was prominent in SER and Tm, especially in the brainstem and thalamus. Zi also developed mild vacuolation with advancing age. Vacuolation seemed to be related to the epileptic phenomena in SER and Tm. Vacuoles consisted mainly of swollen astrocytic processes and enlargement of the extracellular space, as well as occasional enlargement of periaxonal spaces. Thus both pathological findings--the hypomyelination derived from the zitter mutation with tremor, and the vacuolation from the tremor mutation with epileptic symptoms--were mutually exaggerated in SER. It is postulated that the two different genetic loci with zi and tm mutations interact and synergistically reinforce each other both clinically and pathologically in SER. 
Catalase-negative listeria monocytogenes causing meningitis in an adult. Clinical and laboratory features. A 63-year-old previously healthy woman presented with acute meningitis. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded a serotype 1/2a isolate of Listeria monocytogenes that was biochemically typical in all respects, other than the reproducible lack of catalase production. During therapy, the patient developed oculomotor dysfunction that was attributed to an abscess in the internal capsule. This case report documents the existence of catalase-negative L. monocytogenes indicating that catalase production should not be a strict criterion for identification of Listeria. Furthermore, this clinical experience extends in vitro and experimental animal studies indicating that catalase production is not a necessary virulence factor for invasion by Listeria. 
Perioperative respiratory compliance in children undergoing repair of atrial septal defects. Children with atrial septal defects (ASD) have less respiratory compliance (Crs) than normal cohorts. There could be implications for anaesthetic management if these children also have decreased compliance during anaesthesia. To examine the changes in Crs before, during and following surgical correction of the atrial defect, Crs was measured in 29 infants and children, 15 undergoing correction of secundum type atrial septal defects, and a group of 14 children of similar weight undergoing non-thoracic surgery. During sedation, Crs was measured using the single breath technique (SBT) and during anaesthesia, both before and after the surgical procedure, an inflation technique was applied to determine Crs. To investigate the aetiology of the difference in Crs, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) was determined using echocardiography during sedation in the ASD patients. During sedation, Crs in the ASD group was 52.7 +/- 19.5% less than in the control group. The slope of the line of regression of Crs vs height for the ASD group was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that of the control group during sedation. However, during anaesthesia, Crs in the ASD group was not significantly different from the control group either before or after surgery. The per cent decrease in Crs during sedation in the children with ASD, in comparison with the control group, did not correlate with the Qp:Qs ratio of the ASD group (r2 = 0.012,NS). We conclude that, in spite of lower Crs during sedation, infants and children with ASD do not have lower Crs during anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass than normal controls undergoing non-thoracic surgery. 
Proliferative assessment of GFAP-positive and GFAP-negative glioma cells by nucleolar organizer region staining. The proliferative potential of two types of tumor cells that did or did not express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 19 cases of high-grade gliomas, including nine anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO criteria, grade 3) and 10 glioblastoma multiforme (grade 4), was investigated by a combined staining technique, one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated argyrophilic protein (Ag-NOR) and immunocytochemistry for GFAP. The mean numbers of Ag-NORs in GFAP-positive cells and GFAP-negative cells of high-grade gliomas were 2.68 and 3.74, respectively. The value of GFAP-negative cells was significantly greater than that of GFAP-positive cells (p less than 0.01). Our results show that, by means of the immunocytochemistry for GFAP, tumor cells in human high-grade gliomas can be divided into two groups expressing GFAP or not, and that the mean number of Ag-NORs of GFAP-negative cells is more representative of the degree of histological malignancy than that of positive cells. It is considered that the proliferative assessment of GFAP-negative tumor cells in high-grade gliomas by combined staining of Ag-NOR silver staining and GFAP immunocytochemistry is useful for understanding the histological malignancy of high-grade gliomas. 
Twenty-four-hour variation of blood pressure in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. Using a noninvasive portable blood pressure recorder, we compared 24-hour variations of blood pressure among 1) 35 patients with Binswanger-type dementia, 2) 43 with lacunar-type dementia, 3) 26 with a single lacunar stroke, and 4) 30 controls. Each group was divided into antihypertensive-treated and -untreated subgroups. Among the untreated subgroups, patients with Binswanger-type dementia had significantly greater 24-hour mean systolic blood pressures, 24-hour systolic blood pressure standard deviations, and maximal systolic blood pressure variations than the controls (p less than 0.05). Among the treated patients, blood pressure variability increased similarly in all subgroups with cerebrovascular lesions compared with the controls (p less than 0.05). The nocturnal blood pressure decreases seen in the controls were absent among both untreated and treated patients with Binswanger- or lacunar-type dementia (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest the importance of hypertension, short-term variations in blood pressure, and a sustained nighttime elevation of blood pressure for the pathogenesis of both Binswanger-type and lacunar-type dementia in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. 
Radial nerve paralysis and tumor. This paper presents ten cases of radial nerve paralysis because of tumor and reviews 38 previously reported cases. The tumor distribution was 35 lipomas, four neurofibromas, four ganglions, three neuromas, one fibroma, and one neurilemoma. Malignant tumors are not discussed in this review. Electromyography is of value if diagnostic problems occur. Postoperative results are normally good. 
Dynamic F waves in neurogenic claudication. Serial F waves were elicited before and after ambulation in 2 patients with neurogenic claudication. In both patients dynamic changes in F wave parameters consisting of either unelicitability or increased latencies occurred postexercise. The time course of these changes and their subsequent rapid reversibility over 15 minutes suggest ischemic-induced conduction block and slowing in proximal motor axons. These physiological changes may account for some of the dynamic neurological symptoms of this disorder. Moreover, F wave exercise testing may provide corroborative information for the diagnosis of neurogenic claudication. 
Ten-year survivors after surgical treatment and perioperative irradiation for esophageal carcinoma. Ten of 150 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and surgically treated, survived for more than 10 years. All 10 underwent a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection plus perioperative irradiation. The clinicopathologic findings in these 10 patients were reviewed. Five were female. Seven of the tumors exceeded 6 cm in length; seven were early stage, and the remaining three were advanced stage tumors. Lymph node metastases were evident in three, lymph vessel permeation was recognized in four, and no vascular vessel permeation was seen in any tumor. Two tumors had a characteristic appearance of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma, suggesting a good prognosis. In six for which cytophotometric DNA analysis could be done, four were type II, two were type III, and none was type IV. Thus, a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection can lead to a long survival time even for those with an advanced primary esophageal carcinoma. 
Determination of prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound. Estimation of prostate gland volume with transrectal ultrasound may provide important information in the evaluation of benign and malignant prostatic diseases. To determine the most accurate means of volume estimation 150 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound with 15 separate methods of volume estimation. All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy. Prostate specimen weights were compared with the results of each volume estimation method. Step-section planimetry, previously assumed to be the most accurate means of volume measurement, exhibited a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93. The elliptical volume, widely used as an alternative to planimetry, demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.90. The most accurate method to estimate prostate weight (r = 0.94) was a variation of the prolate spheroid formula, expressed as pi/6 (transverse dimension)2 (anteroposterior dimension). When different volume ranges were considered, this prolate spheroid formula provided the closest estimate of weight in glands of less than 40 gm. and those in the 40 to 80 gm. range. The most accurate method to estimate prostates weighing greater than 80 gm. was the formula pi/6 (transverse dimension)3. 
Endoscopic therapy for early colon cancer: the strip biopsy resection technique. Strip biopsy is an endoscopic tissue resection technique in which a lesion and its surrounding tissues are first elevated using physiological saline. The saline solution is injected into the submucosa at the site of the lesion with the help of needle forceps. A snare is placed around the elevated tissue, which is then resected endoscopically by electrocoagulation. The specimen obtained includes both submucosal and mucosal tissues. The authors used this technique to resect a total of 71 lesions of the colon. They were classified histologically as 21 adenocarcinomas, 46 adenomas, 3 metaplastic polyps, and 1 juvenile polyp. All lesions were confirmed to be entirely intramucosal by histological examination. The strip biopsy technique permits resection of tissue down to the submucosal layer regardless of the morphological type of the lesion. This suggests that strip biopsy is an effective new form of endoscopic treatment for early colon cancer. 
Fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal adenomas. An association between fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal carcinoma has been reported. A relationship between S. bovis and colorectal adenomas has also been suggested. In the present study, the relationship between S. bovis and adenomas was investigated. Two of 18 current adenoma patients (11%) were found to have S. bovis in their stool compared with 12 of 84 controls (14%). Six of 38 patients who had ever had a diagnosis of adenoma (16%) had S. bovis compared with 8 of 64 controls (13%). These results rule out a strong association between fecal carriage of S. bovis and adenomas; however, because of the relatively small sample size, a weak to moderate association cannot be excluded. 
Eicosanoids regulate tumor necrosis factor synthesis after hemorrhage in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether PGE2 regulates TNF release in vitro and in vivo following hemorrhage. To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to a mean blood pressure (BP) of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then resuscitated. For in vitro studies, peritoneal (pM phi) and splenic (sM phi) macrophages obtained at 2 hours and 24 hours after hemorrhage were stimulated with LPS for 24 or 48 hours with or without ibuprofen (IBU). For in vivo studies, M phi were harvested 24 hours following hemorrhage with and without IBU treatment and stimulated with LPS for 48 hours. The decreased TNF release by pM phi but not sM phi from hemorrhaged mice was restored by IBU in vitro. IBU treatment in vivo significantly enhanced TNF release by pM phi compared with untreated hemorrhaged animals, while TNF release by sM phi was only slightly increased. These data indicate a major role of PGE2 in the regulation of TNF release by pM phi following hemorrhage. 
Sex hormones in postmenopausal women with primary biliary cirrhosis. To evaluate serum sex hormone profiles in nonalcoholic postmenopausal women with liver disease, 25 women with primary biliary cirrhosis (11 in cirrhotic stage) and 46 healthy controls were studied. The patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated serum concentrations of estrone and androstenedione and significantly (p less than 0.05) lower concentrations of estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone compared with the 46 controls. Serum concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone, non-sex hormone binding globulin-bound testosterone and non-protein-bound testosterone did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05) between primary biliary cirrhosis patients and controls. Patients in the cirrhotic stage had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin than did controls. Patients in the cirrhotic stage had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher sex hormone binding globulin and estrone sulfate levels compared with noncirrhotic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise, no significant differences were observed between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. The observed changes in steroid concentrations may be a consequence of hepatic dysfunction. 
DNA image cytometry of keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The distinction between the keratoacanthoma (KA) and the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can sometimes be difficult on the basis of histologic and clinical criteria. The possible diagnostic significance of DNA ploidy initiated the present study evaluating the DNA ploidy in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 7 KA and 15 SCC, and fresh frozen tissue touch preparations of 15 of the same cases using the CAS 200 Image Analyzer. In paraffin-embedded tissue sections the main peak DNA index was based on normal epidermis, and ranged from 1.03 to 1.59 in KA and from 1.47-2.71 in SCC. The DNA Index (DI) discriminated KA from SCC in 17 of 22 cases (p less than 0.0007). The highest DNA content of single nuclei ranged from 9.0-18.0 picograms (pg) (DI 2.9-6.03) in KA and 14.8-38.6 pg (DI 4.0-11.03) in SCC. The highest DNA content discriminated KA from SCC in 16 of 22 cases (p less than 0.003). In fresh frozen tissue touch preparations from 15 of the same lesions, there was considerable overlap in DNA indices of KA (0.534-1.39) and SCC (0.464-1.41). Abnormal DNA peaks seen in histograms from three SCC in paraffin-embedded tissue sections were lost in the touch preparation histograms, probably due to inadequate sampling. Therefore, image analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections is better able to distinguish KA from SCC than touch preparations. 
The physician's responsibilities: residua and sequelae. Cardiologists assuming responsibility for adults with congenital heart disease must have knowledge of electrophysiologic, valvular (native valves), prosthetic (valves, patches and conduits), ventricular (especially chamber function), vascular (especially elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) and noncardiovascular residua and sequelae. Acquired cardiac and noncardiac diseases coexist in older adults with postoperative congenital heart disease and add to the physician's responsibilities. 
Use of a guideline based questionnaire to audit hospital care of acute asthma. OBJECTIVES--To design an audit questionnaire and pilot its use by an audit assistant to monitor inpatient management of acute asthma and to compare the care given by chest physicians and general physicians. DESIGN--Retrospective review by a chest physician and audit assistant of a random sample of 76 case records of patients by a criterion based questionnaire developed from hospital guidelines on management of acute asthma. SETTING--One district general hospital. PATIENTS--76 adult patients with acute asthma: 38 admitted with a relevant primary diagnosis between April 1988 and March 1989 and a further 38 admitted through the accident and emergency department between April 1989 and March 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Conformity with recognised standards for assessment and management of acute asthma before and after the audit and by chest physicians and general physicians. RESULTS--Age and sex did not differ significantly between the different groups of patients. Overall, deviations from the guidelines occurred in recording measures of severity of asthma, emergency treatment with beta 2 agonists (60/76, 79%) and steroids (43/76, 57%), and prescription of antibiotics in accordance with at least one criterion of the guidelines (29/45, 64%). Chest physicians were more rigorous than general physicians in recording severity measures, especially serum potassium concentration (chi 2 = 3.6, df = 1, p = 0.06), emergency steroid treatment within the correct period (chi 2 = 3.9, df = 1, p = 0.05), and referral for follow up at an outpatient chest clinic. Recording of arterial blood gas tensions improved significantly between the 1988-9 and 1989-90 samples (chi 2 = 7.0, df = 1, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS--The questionnaire proved easy to use for both doctor and audit assistant. The audit improved few standards of care and emphasises the need for further reinforcement and feedback. 
Surgical removal of massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with age-related macular degeneration. The authors report on 11 patients with age-related macular degeneration associated with massive subretinal hemorrhage, who were treated with surgical removal of the hemorrhage and associated fibrosis. Preoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to hand motions. Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to light perception with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up. Complications included partial or total retinal detachment in four patients (36%) and cataract in four patients (36%). Four of 11 patients showed some improvement in vision (36%). All four of these patients had surgery within 1 week of the onset of severe visual loss. Although surgical removal of large subretinal hemorrhages is technically feasible, visual recovery is limited, even in uncomplicated cases, by macular degenerative changes. 
Bilateral parotid secondaries from primary bronchial carcinoid tumour. Three years following a right lower lobectomy for primary carcinoid tumour of the bronchus, a patient presented with bilateral parotid masses. On investigation, both these were shown to be carcinoid tumours, consistent with metastatic spread from the primary bronchial tumour. This unique case is presented together with a discussion of the diagnostic methods employed. 
Serious infections involving the CDC group Ve bacteria Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans. Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans are phenotypically similar gram-negative bacilli and are also referred to as CDC groups Ve-1 and Ve-2, respectively. These bacteria are rarely reported as pathogens in humans. Infections described in the literature include primarily bacteremia in critically ill patients and peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We describe three cases of polymicrobial infection secondary to infection with group Ve organisms, including the first reported case (to our knowledge) of CNS infection due to F. oryzihabitans. These three cases and a review of literature suggest an association between the presence of indwelling catheters and polymicrobial infections with CDC group Ve organisms. F. oryzihabitans and C. luteola should be added to the expanding list of nosocomial pathogens with a propensity to infect critically ill patients who have undergone surgical procedures and/or had indwelling catheters placed. The isolation of either of these organisms from clinical specimens should prompt a search for a device-related source. 
Staphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. Comparison to Escherichia coli. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism. 
Independent genetic determinants of pancreatic and pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis The concordance of pancreatic and pulmonary status among siblings with cystic fibrosis, the cystic fibrosis genotype, and non-genetic factors were analysed in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Genetic factors were more important than non-genetic factors in affecting the severity of pancreatic and lung disease. The genetic factors were independent of each other and did not invariably cosegregate with specific mutations at the cystic fibrosis locus. 
Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. 
Self-reported sleep quality in HIV infection: correlation to the stage of infection and zidovudine therapy. We investigated self-reported sleep quality in a group of 50 patients in different stages of HIV-1 infection by using a standardized questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Alterations of sleep were found to be significantly correlated with the most severe stage of infection in AIDS patients. Analysis of data failed to indicate a significant influence of zidovudine on self-reported sleep quality. 
Life-threatening cervico-mediastinal haematoma after carotid sinus massage. Retropharyngeal and cervico-mediastinal haematomas are rare but potentially fatal entities. The potential for airway compression necessitates rapid assessment and treatment. A cervico-mediastinal haematoma following carotid sinus massage which required cervical drainage is presented. This is a life-threatening event demanding a high index of suspicion. A review of the literature and indications for treatment are discussed. 
Turbinate hypertrophy in habitual snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea: findings of acoustic rhinometry. Forty-five habitual snorers (mean respiratory disturbance index = 6) and 22 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean respiratory disturbance index = 36) were examined by polysomnography, radiocephalometry, rhinomanometry, nasopharyngeal videoendoscopy, and acoustic rhinometry. In 97% of these patients, hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates was found by acoustic rhinometry, while increased nasal resistance of various degrees was measured in 93% of all patients by active anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated that the most resistive segment was located in the anterior parts of the nasal cavity and was built up by two compartments: the region of the isthmus nasi and the region of the head of the inferior turbinate. In our snoring patients, the cross-sectional areas at the head of the inferior turbinate were always smaller than the cross-sectional areas in the isthmus nasi, which in normal controls presented the minimal cross-sectional values of the whole nasal cavity. While rhino-manometry can only measure the amount of nasal resistance, acoustic rhinometry can clearly determine the exact size and location of the different stenoses in the nasal cavity that contribute to the increased nasal resistance. 
Real-time digital contrast enhancement and magnification in the assessment of acute elbow injuries. The elbow is a common site of injury and missed fractures may lead to disability and litigation. An assessment was made of a commercially available desk-top digital contrast enhancement and magnification unit (DETECT system) in a series of 320 patients with an acute elbow injury. Five radiologists of varying experience independently viewed elbow radiographs on a conventional light-box, and subsequently using the digitizer, indicating the presence or absence of a fracture. The overall results demonstrated no difference in performance when using the unit, though small improvements in the confidence with which a definite diagnosis was made were observed. Assessment of soft tissues with the digitizer was less reliable. 
Percutaneous iliac artery stent: angiographic long-term follow-up. The authors conducted a prospective study of 49 consecutive patients with 53 lesions in 52 iliac arteries. All were treated between October 1987 and April 1990 with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and insertion of either a self-expandable or balloon-expandable stent. Lesions included total occlusion (28%), dissection (42%), post-PTA restenosis (21%), and unsatisfactory PTA (9%). Complications included one aortic protrusion, one acute thrombosis of the stent (resolved with urokinase), and three distal embolizations (5.7%) (resolved with urokinase and aspiration). During 15 months of follow-up, two patients died (one after occlusion). Three other occlusions occurred; one of these was resolved with local thrombolysis. Hyperplasia occurred in seven cases (13.5%), and stenosis occurred at the end of the stent because of incomplete covering of the lesion in three (5.8%); a complementary procedure was performed in six of these cases. Primary patency was 85.3% at 12 months and 80.9% at 18 months; secondary patency rate was 96.1% at 12 and at 18 months. At the end of the study, excluding data for the two patients who died, 27 limbs (54%) were asymptomatic and improvement was achieved in 19 (38%); the clinical success rate was 92%. No amputations were required. 
Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. In 68 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage the effect of heparin treatment beginning on the second, fourth or tenth day was investigated. Early (day 2) low-dose heparin medication significantly lowered the incidence of pulmonary embolism. An increase in the number of patients with rebleeding was not observed. The results indicate that the early use of heparin in these patients is safe and can be recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. 
Transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions in coronary artery disease. Transtelephonic monitoring of a single-lead electrocardiogram and on-demand 2-way voice communication were accomplished at 1,865 exercise sessions for 67 cardiac patients. Exercise sessions occurred either at the patients' homes or at remote hospital sites and began an average of 25 or 14 weeks, respectively, after hospital dismissal. Monitoring centers provided experienced nurses to direct all exercise sessions. The transtelephonic monitoring equipment was reliable with only one instance of system failure observed. A broad spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease, including some classified at higher risk, participated in the program. Patients exercised with a variety of equipment (cycle ergometer, treadmill, arm ergometer, cross-country ski simulator, combination arm-leg cycle ergometer, rowing machine), for 30 to 50 minutes, 1 to 3 times each week. No medical emergencies occurred, although 18 specific problems were discovered that led to further evaluation or change in the medical program of specific patients. Transtelephonic monitoring of cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions at home and at remote hospitals appears safe and is attractive because not all patients have access to supervised exercise programs; this exercise assessment helps to maximally use highly trained cardiac rehabilitation personnel. 
Epilepsy and brain tumors: implications for treatment. Primary intraparenchymal tumors of the brain are important etiologic factors in partial or focal epilepsy. Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment. Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free. Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome. Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex. Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions. Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy. 
Ibopamine in the treatment of heart failure. Efficacy and safety of a drug are essential criteria to be fulfilled before a new drug receives recommendation. This review focuses on the safety of ibopamine in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Ibopamine is a new, orally active drug with a predominant action on dopaminergic adrenoceptors. As a result, it reduces systemic vascular resistance, increases cardiac output, and increases renal flow. Ibopamine also modulates the neuroendocrine reflexes in heart failure; plasma renin activity and norepinephrine and aldosterone plasma concentrations are reduced, both immediately and during sustained administration. Ibopamine has proved to be safe in many thousands of heart failure patients during long-term therapy. This argues well for its use as an alternative or additive therapy in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. 
Prospective randomized evaluation of ciprofloxacin versus piperacillin plus amikacin for empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group. Empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients is mandatory, but whether monotherapy is a safe alternative and whether fluoroquinolones are useful agents for this indication are still controversial issues. The use of monotherapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 to 300 mg every 12 h) was evaluated against combined therapy with piperacillin plus amikacin in febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumor or lymphoma. The study was discontinued prematurely because patients treated with ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower overall success rate than patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin (31 of 48 patients [65%] versus 48 of 53 patients [91%], P = 0.002). Patients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia had a particularly poor outcome: therapy failed for six of eight patients (75%) treated with ciprofloxacin, while therapy failed for none of four patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Death from primary infection during initially randomized protocol therapy occurred in 7 of 48 patients (14.5%) treated with ciprofloxacin and in 3 of 53 (6%) treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. This study does not support the use of this dose of intravenous ciprofloxacin as empiric monotherapy for fever in granulocytopenic patients. 
Myocardial reperfusion injury. Platelet-activating factor stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocyte hydrogen peroxide production during myocardial reperfusion. To study the roles of platelet-activating factor, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and oxygen free radicals in myocardial reperfusion injury, we subjected 10 sheep to 90 minutes of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Stainings with gentian violet and tetratriphenyl ammonium chloride demonstrated 20% +/- 3% of the left ventricular mass at risk for ischemia, of which 75% +/- 10% underwent infarction. Coronary sinus blood was assayed for platelet-activating factor and neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production before and during coronary occlusion and during reperfusion. Platelet-activating factor was isolated by column chromatography and lipid extraction and quantified by radioimmunoassay. Neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production was measured by a 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein flow-cytometric assay. Platelet-activating factor was elevated to 899 +/- 210 pg/ml at 15 minutes of reperfusion, compared with the preocclusion level of 271 +/- 55 pg/ml and coronary occlusion level of 359 +/- 64 pg/ml (p less than 0.05; analysis of variance). Neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production, measured on a relative fluorescence scale, was also elevated to a level of 141 +/- 27 at 1 hour of reperfusion, compared with the preocclusion level of 103 +/- 6 and the coronary occlusion level of 114 +/- 13 (p less than 0.01; analysis of variance). Both of these parameters returned toward baselines at the end of 6 hours of reperfusion. Histologic examination revealed infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the interstitium of the reperfused myocardium. Neutrophils isolated from unoperated and healthy sheep demonstrated a graded dose response in hydrogen peroxide production when stimulated by purified platelet-activating factor in vitro. These findings suggest that platelet-activating factor is released in the coronary circulation and is a mediator of oxygen free radical production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes during myocardial reperfusion. 
Have general hospitals become chronic care institutions for the mentally ill? OBJECTIVE: Dramatic increases in lengths of stay for general hospital psychiatric patients in New York City in recent years have raised speculation that general hospitals are assuming a large responsibility for care of the chronically mentally ill. This study examines changes in utilization patterns and patient characteristics to assess whether such a trend is occurring. METHOD: The authors obtained discharge abstract data for all New York City general hospital adult psychiatric patients in 1985 and 1988 as well as utilization data from the public general hospital system for 1977-1989. Three measures of chronicity were chosen: hospital stays longer than 60 days, discharges to long-term care, and three or more admissions per year. Data on psychiatric diagnoses and comorbid diagnoses for chronically ill patients were also reviewed. RESULTS: The mean length of stay of psychiatric patients in general hospitals has increased substantially in recent years and nearly tripled in the public hospitals during 1977-1989. Between 1985 and 1988, citywide increases were due largely to a growing proportion of patients with very long stays. Patients with stays longer than 60 days accounted for 35% of all inpatient days in 1988, compared with 27% in 1985. Patients with chronic illness accounted for half of all days in 1988, compared with 38% in 1985. CONCLUSIONS: Although many factors have contributed to these trends, the leading cause has been reimbursement policies favoring short-term inpatient care. Improving accountability for community treatment programs will be the key to redirecting funding priorities and creating more appropriate alternatives for the chronically mentally ill. 
Failure of early electrocardiogram to predict successful thrombolysis. Effect of stunned myocardium? We investigated the value of the modified Selvester QRS score in predicting reperfusion in 74 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were treated with intravenous streptokinase. Coronary angiography and time to peak creatine kinase level were used to determine the success of thrombolytic therapy. At 6 weeks a significant difference was seen between the QRS score of the patients in whom thrombolysis was successful compared with those in whom there was no reperfusion. There was, however, no difference between the QRS score of these groups of patients at 1 week. The ejection fraction at 1 week was 60% and 51%, respectively. The failure of the early electrocardiogram to predict reperfusion and improved left ventricular function may be a consequence of the stunned myocardium. 
Lack of gastric acid rebound after stopping a successful short-term course of nizatidine in duodenal ulcer patients. To assess whether there is rebound of gastric acidity after a short-term course of H2-receptor antagonists, we performed a 24-h in situ pH monitoring on 17 duodenal ulcer patients before, during, and after completing 4 wks' treatment with nizatidine 300 mg at bedtime (2200 h). Three around-the-clock continuous intragastric pH-metries were carried out the day before beginning treatment, at the end of the nizatidine course, and 67 h after the last dose of the drug was given. Nizatidine produced mean pH values that were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the pretreatment profile during both the whole 24-h period and the nighttime (2400-0759), and this confirms that it effectively inhibited gastric acidity. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the acidity indexes of pH profiles obtained before dosing and after discontinuing treatment in any of the time intervals considered. Therefore, it appears that a short term course of nizatidine therapy does not cause rebound hyperacidity in duodenal ulcer patients. 
PET measurements of hyperthermia-induced suppression of protein synthesis in tumors in relation to effects on tumor growth. Hyperthermia-induced metabolic changes in tumor tissue have been monitored by PET. Uptake of L-[1-11C]tyrosine in rhabdomyosarcoma tissue of Wag/Rij rats was dose-dependently reduced after local hyperthermia treatment at 42, 45, or 47 degrees C. Tumor blood flow, as measured by PET with 13NH3, appeared to be unchanged. The L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data were compared to uptake data of L-[1-14C]tyrosine and with data on the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins. After intravenous injection, the 14C data were obtained from dissected tumor tissue. Heat-induced inhibition of the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins tallied with the L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data. Heat-induced inhibition of amino acid uptake in the tumor correlated well with regression of tumor growth. It is concluded that PET using L-[1-11C]tyrosine is eligible for monitoring the effect of hyperthermia on tumor growth. 
Aortic valve reconstruction in Rubinstein-Taybi-syndrome: the valuable aid of transesophageal echocardiography. A fourteen year old boy with Rubinstein-Taybi-syndrome presented with a severe congenital subvalvular fibrous aortic stenosis with associated aortic regurgitation. Transthoracic echocardiographic imaging and left heart angiography showed a transvalvular peak systolic pressure gradient of 90 mmHg and a regurgitant fraction of 30%. The surgical treatment consisted of resection of the subvalvular fibrous tissue and subsequent aortic valvuloplasty. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a wide systolic opening of the aortic valve and good coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in diastole. Two-dimensional color-coded and contrast echocardiography were successfully used to confirm a satisfactory reconstruction. Transesophageal echocardiography therefore represents a valuable tool in the assessment of the morphologic and haemodynamic status, especially in rare cases of congenital heart disease in older children. 
Histologic observations and P-glycoprotein expression in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemotherapy. To describe histologic changes associated with chemotherapy response, we reviewed biopsy and resection specimens from 52 patients with locally advanced esophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative chemotherapy, followed by resection. P-Glycoprotein expression in the adenocarcinomas was also determined with the use of antibody C219. Significant changes in morphologic appearance of the tumor between prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy samples was noted in 17 tumors (32.7%). The most frequent changes observed in these 17 tumors were a decrease in tumor cellularity and an increase in dense fibrosis in comparison with the prechemotherapy specimen. In signet-ring cell carcinomas, the intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles were often smaller after chemotherapy, making tumor cells more difficult to identify. Another finding observed in tumors that showed histologic alteration after chemotherapy was the formation of large mucin pools that contained lymphocytes and macrophages. The remaining 35 tumors showed similar histologic features in prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy specimens. P-Glycoprotein was identified in 15 (29.4%) of 51 specimens after chemotherapy. P-Glycoprotein content of the residual tumors did not correlate with stage, degree of differentiation, or clinically determined chemotherapy response. We concluded that chemotherapy-induced changes in morphology were frequent in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemotherapy. These changes should be recognized as they may cause difficulties in both gross and histologic evaluation of the extent of tumor in postchemotherapy resection specimens. The response of adenocarcinomas to this chemotherapy protocol does not appear to be linked to P-glycoprotein expression. 
Surgical options in 424 patients with primary breast cancer without systemic metastases. Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations in about 40% of 424 consecutive patients who had invasive breast cancer with no evidence of systemic metastases. Half of the women considered suitable for local excision of the breast cancer followed by radiotherapy (conservation) elected to have mastectomy, and intraoperative findings dictated mastectomy in about 20% of those electing conservation. Consequently, conservation was accomplished in about one quarter of those treated for breast cancer. Younger rather than older women more frequently expressed the desire for breast conservation. 
The EEG as a monitor of midazolam amnesia: changes in power and topography as a function of amnesic state. In order to identify EEG parameters that might be specific for identifying amnesia during midazolam infusion, we examined changes in the EEG power spectrum associated with a period of amnesia, determined by inability to recall a sequence of numbers and objects presented verbally, after intravenous midazolam 0.07 mg/kg in ten normal volunteers. Measurements were taken at baseline, during infusion immediately before and after the onset of amnesia, immediately at end of infusion, and 0.5 and 1.5 h after infusion. All subjects had onset of amnesia during infusion, were completely amnesic by the end of infusion, partially amnesic 0.5 h after infusion, and had complete recall by 1.5 h after infusion. The EEG beta power increased and alpha power decreased during amnesic periods. The beta 1/alpha power ratio was the parameter most specific for amnesia. From a baseline value of 0.20 +/- 0.05 (standard error of the mean [SEM]), it increased to 0.96 +/- 0.26 at the end of infusion and decreased to 0.61 +/- 0.15 0.5 h after infusion. By 1.5 h after infusion, all EEG parameters had returned to baseline values. Beta power changes associated with midazolam amnesia were most pronounced in the Fz and Cz lead positions, and alpha power changes were most pronounced in the Oz position. We conclude that 1) EEG power values, particularly the beta 1/alpha ratio, can identify periods of amnesia after midazolam infusion; 2) specific EEG changes and the presence of amnesia vary with the probable serum concentration of midazolam; and 3) the characteristic EEG pattern during partial or complete amnesia varies as one moves across the cerebral cortex. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy in high-risk cirrhotics selected by endoscopic criteria. A multicenter randomized controlled trial. Controlled trials of sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotics have given conflicting results. In the present study, 106 cirrhotics were randomized to sclerotherapy (55 patients) or control group (51 patients). Admission criteria were no history of previous variceal bleeding and the presence of high-risk varices, i.e., a variceal score less than or equal to 0 according to Beppu et al. Sclerotherapy sessions were performed at time zero, 7 days, 30 days, and then monthly until eradication. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 6-month intervals thereafter. Control patients underwent repeat endoscopy at 6-month intervals. Bleeding episodes were treated by sclerotherapy in both groups, whenever possible. Mean follow-up was 24 months. Analysis of the results was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Variceal bleeding occurred in 19 sclerotherapy patients (34.5%) and in 17 controls (35.4%, P = NS). Overall mortality was 34.5% in sclerotherapy patients and 50% in controls (P = NS). Seven of the 19 sclerotherapy patients (36.8%) and 11 of the 17 controls (64.7%) who bled died of hemorrhage (P less than 0.05, log-linear model). It is concluded that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotics. However, there seems to be a trend toward a lower bleeding-related mortality in sclerotherapy patients than in controls. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoid heart disease. Right heart failure in patients with carcinoid heart disease is a serious prognostic sign. Consideration and adequate timing of valvular operations seem essential for the postoperative outcome. Without any relation to duration or progression of the metastasizing tumor disease, right heart failure developed and increased rapidly for a period of 12 to 17 months in four patients with classic carcinoid syndrome. Invasive hemodynamic and cardiac ultrasound investigations revealed severe carcinoid heart disease, and medical decompensation treatment gradually failed. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve replacement operations resulted in dramatic improvement in three of the patients, and these patients were still free of cardiac symptoms 10, 12, and 38 months postoperatively. One patient died 5 days postoperatively probably of septicemia. The preoperative and postoperative development of the cardiac disease is evaluated clinically, by cardiac ultrasound and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and related to the tumor disease. Surgical anatomy and operative technique are reported, and the beneficial value of prophylactic treatment of the effects of tumor-released vasoactive substances by a somatostatin analog is emphasized. 
Role of percutaneous nephrostomy in patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma. Percutaneous nephrostomy has become a well-established procedure for a wide variety of urologic disorders. However, its role in the management of patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma has not been defined. We utilized percutaneous nephrostomy in 23 renal units for the evaluation or treatment of 21 patients in whom standard techniques were inconclusive or inadequate. The percutaneous nephrostomy provided adequate relief of obstruction in the face of significant azotemia or infection. Diagnostic abilities were improved through the use of antegrade pyelography, selective cytologic examination, and, at times, by providing direct access for endoscopic visualization and biopsy. In select cases, the percutaneous access provided a route for definitive or adjunctive treatment of the lesion. Complications were few and seeding of the tract or local tumor spread has not occurred at follow-up ranging from one to one hundred twenty-one (mean 27.8) months. 
Cricothyroid muscle responses to increased chemical drive in awake normal humans. To examine the response of the cricothyroid muscle (CT) to increased chemical drive, we measured its electromyogram simultaneously with that of the alae nasi (AN) in seven normal awake subjects. During both progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia and hypoxia, peak integrated inspiratory activity (moving time average, MTA) of the CT and AN increased as a power function of mean inspiratory flow (ratio of tidal volume to inspiratory time, VT/TI), given by MTA = a(VT/TI)b + c (where a, b, and c are constants). The exponent b varied from 0.009 to 3.4 among subjects but was correlated between CT and AN both during hypercapnia (r = 0.86) and hypoxia (r = 0.81). The onset of inspiratory activity of the CT and AN preceded that of inspiratory flow. Expressed as a percentage of expiratory time, the CT lead time rose from 7% at rest to 20% during hyperpnea. The corresponding values for the AN were from 22 to 52% (both P less than 0.03). Thus the pattern of response of the CT and AN is similar and related to that of the inspiratory muscles in a curvilinear manner. The findings suggest that during chemical stimulation the electrical activity of the CT is analogous to that of the AN, an upper airway dilator. 
The efficacy of fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy in the detection of early nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy of the nasopharynx was done in 130 patients as a prospective study. They all had elevated titers of antibodies against the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus but no symptoms or signs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Each underwent a biopsy from six fixed sites in the nasopharynx. Of the 780 biopsy specimens taken from seven patients, 11 showed the presence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Techniques to improve the yields of such biopsies with fiberoptic endoscopy are discussed. The presence of tumor was unrelated to the macroscopic endoscopic findings. The highest incidence of subclinical tumor is in the pharyngeal recess. 
Special considerations in the physical exam of older patients. For diagnostic utility, aspects of the standard physical examination are modified for elderly patients. Special attention is paid to problems that interfere with function, such as gait disorders, incontinence, and hearing and visual loss. Certain findings in cardiac and pulmonary examinations of the elderly require different interpretations. The examination should include the head and neck, chest, back, abdomen, breasts and pelvic area in women, prostate in men, extremities, and skin, as well as mental status. A number of diagnostic maneuvers are used to distinguish changes of normal aging from those associated with disease. 
Intracranial metastasis from carcinoma of the paranasal sinus. Carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses are locally invasive tumors that only occasionally metastasize. The tumor may spread intracranially by local invasion through the dura into the frontal lobes and extension along the vidian nerve. We describe two cases of cerebellar metastasis in patients with local recurrence and discuss the mechanism of spreading. It is possible that more aggressive treatment of these tumors, which results in longer survival, may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial metastasis. 
Natural course of clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma in men less than 70 years old. A total of 61 patients, less than 70 years old at diagnosis, with clinical stage T1-2, NX, M0, cytologically well or moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma was prospectively included in a surveillance study. Median patient age was 63 years (range 38 to 69 years). Mean followup was 96 +/- 24 months. The probability of local progression to stage T3 disease after 5 and 10 years was 49 and 72%, respectively. The probability of metastases developing after 5 and 10 years was 8 and 23%, respectively. The probability of dying of prostate adenocarcinoma was 2 and 8%, respectively. Moderately differentiated cancer progressed locally significantly faster than well differentiated disease. The relative number of patients who had metastases or died of prostate adenocarcinoma found in our study was comparable to the relative numbers reported after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. Therefore, deferred therapy may be an alternative to active therapy in patients with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma and with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. 
Hepatitis B vaccination programs for health care personnel in U.S. hospitals. A random sample of 232 U.S. hospitals was surveyed. Of those hospitals, 75 percent had hepatitis B vaccination programs. The presence of a program was associated with hospital size (60 percent of those with 100 beds, 75 percent with 100-499 beds, 90 percent with 500 or more beds; P = 0.0013) and hospital location (urban 86 percent; rural 57 percent; P less than 0.001). The frequency of needlestick exposures per month among hospital personnel and hospital location were directly related to and best predicted the existence of hepatitis B vaccination programs. All hospitals with programs offered vaccine to high-risk personnel (as defined by the hospital). Seventy-seven percent of hospitals paid all costs for vaccinating high-risk personnel; 19 percent paid for any employee to be vaccinated regardless of risk status. Forty-six percent of hospitals with programs were estimated to have vaccinated more than 10 percent of all eligible personnel, and 13 percent to have vaccinated more than 25 percent of eligible personnel. The highest compliance rates were associated with hospitals paying for the vaccine and requiring vaccination of high-risk personnel. Fifty-four percent of hospitals attributed noncompliance to concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. The reasons why there was no vaccination program in 58 hospitals were (a) low incidence of hepatitis B virus infections among personnel, (b) cost of vaccine, and (c) vaccination being offered as part of a needlestick protocol. Full utilization of hepatitis B vaccine could eliminate the occupational hazard that hepatitis B virus presents to health care personnel. 
Acute effects of parenteral beta-blockade on regional ventricular function of infarct and noninfarct zones after reperfusion therapy in humans. Although the mechanism is unknown, clinical trials have suggested that intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent early cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. Previous studies have examined effects of beta-blockers on global left ventricular function after myocardial infarction; however, few data exist regarding their immediate effects on regional function or in patients after successful reperfusion. Therefore, 65 patients in whom thrombolysis with or without coronary angioplasty achieved reperfusion at 4.6 +/- 1.7 h from symptom onset were studied. Low osmolarity contrast ventriculograms were obtained immediately before and after administration of 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol (n = 54) or placebo (n = 11). Intravenous metoprolol immediately decreased heart rate (from 92 to 76 beats/min, p less than 0.0001), increased left ventricular diastolic volume (from 150 to 163 ml, p less than 0.001) and systolic volume (from 72 to 77 ml, p less than 0.0005) but did not change systolic and diastolic pressures. Although there was no difference in ejection fraction after metoprolol, centerline chord analysis revealed reduced noninfarct zone motion (from 0.41 to 0.12 SD/chord, p less than 0.05), improved infarct zone motion (from -3.1 to -2.9 SD/chord, p less than 0.01) and smaller circumferential extent of hypokinesia (from 30 to 27 chords, p less than 0.05). Patients with dyskinesia of the infarct zone had the most striking improvement in infarct zone wall motion. Because these changes occurred immediately after beta-blockade, they could not be attributed to myocardial salvage. No significant changes in heart rate, left ventricular volumes or regional wall motion were apparent in the control group. 
The significance of venous return impairment in ischemic radiculopathy and myelopathy. Because much of the symptomatology consequent to the constrictive lesions of spinal degenerations may be the result of radicular neurischemia, medullary neurischemia, or both, the structure and responses of the nerve root vasculature to compression or tension are discussed. Although the original investigations concentrated on the arterial side of the radiculomedullary circulation, more recent research has indicated that the venous return phase is far more susceptible to the effects of both intraspinal and extraspinal pathologic conditions. 
Prognostic factors in the conservative treatment of ureteric stones. A prospective study was made of 125 ureteric stones in order to detect factors which would predict the successful outcome of conservative treatment. The factors studied were the duration of pain prior to presentation, pyuria, haematuria, surface regularity of the stone and the degree of obstruction as seen radiologically. In stones less than or equal to 10 mm in size, conservative treatment was successful when the duration of pain was less than 30 days (39/45), when there was no significant pyuria (53/82), when the stones had an irregular surface (44/65) and when obstruction was only partial (55/88). Since most of these factors were interactive, further statistical analysis showed that duration of pain was the only significant factor in predicting the outcome of conservative treatment. In stones greater than 10 mm in size these factors had no predictive value and only 2/23 were passed spontaneously on conservative treatment. 
Excess mortality among 3302 patients with 'pure' anxiety neurosis. The survival probability and causes of death before the age of 70 years were analyzed among 3302 inpatients with "pure" anxiety neurosis in Stockholm County, Sweden, who were tracked in case registries by means of automated record linkage during a 14-year period. When all patients with other psychiatric diagnoses and substance abuse were excluded, and marital status controlled for, there was a significant excess of deaths due to verified and undetermined suicides, ie, nearly one third of all deaths. These unnatural deaths preempted any excess in natural causes before the age of 70 years, such as cardiovascular disease. Treatment policy with regard to the use of anxiolytic drugs was not found to influence mortality. We concluded that the risk of suicide in inpatients before the age of 70 years with anxiety disorders may be as high as that in persons with depression or other diagnoses who require inpatient care. 
Correlations between histopathological and biological findings in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its prognostic significance. Forty-five consecutive cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were morphologically and immunocytochemically studied using monoclonal (anti-B and anti-T cell) and polyclonal (anti-S100 protein and antilysozyme) antibodies with the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method to identify infiltrating lymphocytes (T and B cell) and histiocytes (monocytic/macrophagic and dendritic cells) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A variable density of dendritic cells was found within the tumor nests in 22 (49%) of 45 nasopharyngeal carcinomas examined; infiltrating macrophages were demonstrated in 15 (33%) specimens and around the tumor in almost all cases. Cases with moderate or marked density of dendritic cells (S100+) survived longer than those without such infiltration (mean 5-year survival rates of 31%, 55%, or 64% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively; P less than 0.05). A significant relationship between monocytic/macrophagic cells (lysozyme+) within the tumor and survival was also found (mean 5-year survival rate of 27% or 61% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively). However, lymphocytic infiltration was not statistically related to a better survival. Analyzing lymphocytic infiltration, we found a large prevalence of T cells in the neoplastic tissue without any prognostic significance. These data were correlated to different histological subtypes according to the principal histological classifications of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (Micheau, et al.; World Health Organization; Cologne University) to individualize the scheme which correlates best with prognosis and biological features of nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Our data suggest that, considering dendritic cells and macrophages within cancer nests, nasopharyngeal carcinoma histiotypes can be correlated to patient prognosis. 
Transureteroureterostomy and terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy in advanced pelvic malignancies. Transureteroureterostomy was combined with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy, without complications, in 8 patients with advanced pelvic malignancy and a poor prognosis. Urinary diversion was palliative in all patients and followed pelvic exenteration in 4, debulking of pelvic tumor in 2 and radical cystectomy in 1, while 1 had inoperable bladder cancer. All patients had at least unilateral hydroureteronephrosis preoperatively. In each case a postoperative excretory urogram revealed significant improvement of the hydroureteronephrosis and the serum creatinine improved or stabilized. No patient had ureteral stomal stenosis or retraction. Mean survival was 5 months, with the longest survival being 1 year. Transureteroureterostomy in conjunction with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is an effective technique of urinary diversion in selected patients with a poor prognosis and advanced pelvic malignancy, decreasing operative time while avoiding the morbidity associated with a ureterointestinal operation or nephrostomy. 
Quantitation of axon loss and conduction block in peroneal nerve palsies. We compared conduction in motor fibers supplying the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and anterior lateral compartment (AL) muscles. The object was to determine whether there were any differences in the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked nerve fibers between the longer EDB and shorter AL fibers. In almost every case the percentage of motor fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was greatest in EDB fibers. Conversely, the percentage of conduction block was greatest in the AL motor fibers. As clinical recovery is dependent on AL muscles rather than EDB, electrophysiological study of the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked fibers in the former should provide a more reliable measure of outcome than similar studies of EDB. Conduction velocity distal to the fibular head was not slowed despite the large loss of EDB motor fibers. Evidence for selective involvement of the larger myelinated fibers is, therefore, lacking. The location of the major conduction abnormalities was in almost every case between the mid-fibular head and popliteal fossa. 
Fourier analysis of the cerebrovascular system. We performed Fourier analysis of the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity waveform envelope in 14 normal subjects (group A) and 15 patients, of whom five had arteriovenous malformations (group B), five had cerebral vasospasm (group C), and five had arterial hypertension (group D). Measurements were obtained under conditions of normocapnia, hypercapnia, and hypocapnia. The Fourier coefficients measured in the first five harmonics of the Doppler waveforms of group A were used as the reference baseline and were compared with the coefficients found in the other three groups. Group B showed significantly lower Fourier coefficients, while groups C and D showed higher coefficients (p less than 0.05). The elevation of the Fourier coefficients occurred in an alternating pattern in group C and a decremental pattern in group D. This distinction was attributed to possible differences in the underlying pathophysiological processes. The degree of vascular distensibility of the cerebral arterioles, inferred from the shape of the Fourier analysis curves, was compared in all four groups. Vascular distensibility was characterized as abnormal in arteriovenous malformations, vasospasm, and arterial hypertension. Fourier coefficients may be better indicators of cerebrovascular abnormalities than mean blood flow velocity in hypertension and pulsatility index in arteriovenous malformations, vasospasm, and hypertension. 
Mouse bronchiolar cell carcinogenesis. Histologic characterization and expression of Clara cell antigen in lesions induced by N-nitrosobis-(2-chloroethyl) ureas. Female Swiss mice (Cr:NIH(S)) developed bronchiolar cell hyperplasia, dysplasia, metaplasia, and various morphologic types of bronchiolar cell tumors after topical (skin) application of N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea (NMBCU) or N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (NTCU). These compounds are the first found to induce systemically bronchiolar cell tumors in mice in high incidence. Twice a week, with a 3-day interval, a 25-microliter drop of 0.04 mol/l (molar) NMBCU or NTCU in acetone was applied to the shaved interscapular integument for a maximum of 35 to 40 weeks. The earliest lung neoplasms were seen in mice that died after 23 weeks of treatment and affected 11 of 19 with NMBCU and 14 of 19 with NTCU treatment. Tumor growth pattern was nodular or the neoplastic tissue was frequently disseminated throughout the parenchyma, starting from multicentric peribronchiolar foci. The most common tumor types were squamous cell carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, followed by adenocarcinomas with or without secretory cells, and a single ciliated-cell tumor. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were carried out on paraffin-embedded lungs using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex procedure and antisera against keratin, Clara cell antigen, surfactant apoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin, and chromogranin A. In several mice from both groups, hyperplasias and tumors were composed of cells expressing Clara cell antigen. No tumor cells were found expressing alveolar type II or neuroendocrine cell markers. It appeared that bronchiolar cells, in particular Clara cells, had migrated from terminal bronchioles or invaded bronchiolar walls to extend into the alveolar parenchyma. Squamous cell metaplasia with keratin expression was seen within airways or associated with glandular tumors, especially at the periphery. A unique cell type, with large eosinophilic globules and associated eosinophilic crystals, was seen lining airways or forming hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea- and NTCU-induced mouse bronchiolar cell alterations could be an interesting new model to study mechanisms of bronchiolar cell differentiation and tumor formation. 
Posterior spinal fusion in Sotos' syndrome. Sotos' syndrome (synonym: cerebral gigantism) is the association of mental retardation, macrocephaly and prenatal onset of accelerated growth. The rapid skeletal growth may account for a 4% incidence of scoliosis. General anaesthesia using halothane or enflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen, with opioid supplementation and labetalol to induce moderate hypotension, appeared to be a satisfactory technique for corrective spinal surgery. The potential problems are discussed, with mental retardation and sometimes aggressive behaviour contraindicating a "wake-up" test. Extradural somatosensory evoked potential monitoring is a satisfactory alternative. Hook failures seem more likely than in patients undergoing surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. 
Liver damage in long-term anticonvulsant therapy: a serological and histological study. The prevalence of liver damage in patients receiving long-term anticonvulsant therapy was determined, using a new marker of liver disease, the serum F protein concentration. Abnormal serum F protein concentrations were detected in 50 per cent of 34 patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy. A retrospective analysis of post-mortem liver samples showed common histological abnormalities in three out of seven patients who had died whilst receiving anticonvulsant therapy. These changes were not seen in control patients. We suggest that chronic anticonvulsant therapy may cause significant hepatocellular damage. 
Factors relevant to preventing embolic stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants to prevent embolic stroke is a dilemma for physicians. If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not all of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials. We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding stroke from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of anticoagulants and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use anticoagulant therapy. Using standard assumptions, anticoagulants gave an expected benefit for all subjects. The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to anticoagulants) varied between 5.4 and 46.7. This benefit remained for all subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of stroke prevented by anticoagulants and different rates of intracranial hemorrhage caused by anticoagulants. When we used different baseline rates of stroke and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively. We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic stroke vs the risk of intracranial bleeding from anticoagulant therapy; and the rate of embolic stroke that could be expected for the subject at risk. Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major hemorrhages; the proportion of strokes that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This method of analysis suggests that for most patients anticoagulants are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes. 
Clinical significance of the expression of epidermal growth factor and its receptor in esophageal cancer. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) level in 56 esophageal cancer tissues was measured by 125I-EGF binding assay to elucidate its role in tumor progression. The survival rate of patients with high EGFR level (more than 50 fmol/mg protein) was significantly lower than that of patients with low EGFR level (less than 50 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01), although a correlation between EGFR level and the pathologic findings was not observed. The expression of EGF was examined immunohistochemically using anti-EGF monoclonal antibody in 100 esophageal cancer tissues; EGF-positive tumor cells were detected in 92.0%. The immunoreactivity of EGF was classified arbitrarily into four grades according to the number of stained tumor cells. The expression of EGF significantly correlated with the differentiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P less than 0.01, by chi-square test). The survival rate of patients with high EGF immunoreactivity (Grade 2 or 3) was much lower than in those with lower grade (0 or 1) tumors, (P less than 0.01). Patients with both high EGFR level and EGF immunoreactivity had a much worse prognosis than if both were low. Furthermore, the mitotic index was higher in groups with both high EGFR and EGF than if both were low (16.39 +/- 5.35 versus 6.90 +/- 3.31). These results suggest that EGF and EGFR in the autocrine system may play an important role in tumor progression in esophageal cancer and their expression could be of prognostic significance.
