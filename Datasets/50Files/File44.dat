Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies: relationship to chronic pain coping strategies and adjustment. Recent studies suggest that coping strategies play an important role in adjustment to chronic pain. Identification of factors that influence coping could potentially help clinicians facilitate the use of adaptive coping strategies by pain patients. According to social learning theory, self-efficacy beliefs (judgments regarding one's capabilities) and outcome expectancies (judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors) are significant determinants of coping behavior. This study tested hypotheses derived from social learning theory by examining the contributions of these beliefs to the prediction of coping behavior in chronic pain patients. One hundred and fourteen chronic pain patients completed measures of health-related dysfunction, pain severity, use of 8 coping strategies, and outcome and self-efficacy expectancies regarding these coping strategies. In support of social learning theory, and consistent with research in other areas, the patients' beliefs regarding their capabilities were strongly related to reported coping efforts. Beliefs about the consequences of coping efforts and their interaction with beliefs about capabilities were generally unrelated to coping. These results suggest that treatment should emphasize the actual practice and use of adaptive coping strategies over education about their outcome. 
Ebstein's anomaly appearing in the neonate. A new surgical approach. Ebstein's anomaly appearing during the neonatal period carries a high mortality rate. These infants exhibit cyanosis, acidosis, and congestive heart failure. The pathophysiologic characteristics consist of severe tricuspid regurgitation and functional pulmonary atresia. As a result of the inability of the right ventricle to generate forward flow through the pulmonary arteries, these infants remain dependent on ductal patency. Since May 1988, five newborn infants with severe Ebstein's anomaly have been admitted for treatment at our institution. At initial examination, they weighed 3.6 +/- 1.8 kg and had a mean oxygen tension of 29.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and a mean pH of 7.20 +/- 0.05. Chest roentgenography demonstrated a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.81 +/- 0.02. As determined by echocardiography, the right atria were massively enlarged, severe tricuspid regurgitation was present in all patients, and the pulmonary valves were not opening. All infants were dependent on prostaglandin E1 and attempts to wean them from this drug were unsuccessful. Palliative treatment consisted of tricuspid closure with autologous pericardium and an aortopulmonary shunt of 4 mm polytetrafluoroethylene tubing. There were no operative or late deaths. At discharge, mean oxygen tension was 42.2 +/- 0.85 mm Hg and mean systemic oxygen saturation was 83.2% +/- 1.94%. Infants have grown satisfactorily during the follow-up period. Three infants have since returned for further surgical intervention. One infant, at 11 months of age, underwent a Glenn anastomosis for progressive oxygen desaturation. Two infants have returned, at ages 23 and 22 months, for Fontan procedures, which represent their definitive operative management. We believe this new procedure offers excellent palliative treatment for Ebstein's anomaly in critically ill neonates. Feasibility of later definitive correction is demonstrated by the good results obtained with the Fontan procedure in two infants. 
Foscarnet in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection of the esophagus and colon in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Foscarnet, administered via a central line, was used for the treatment of 18 episodes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophageal ulceration in 15 patients, and in the treatment of 27 episodes of CMV colitis in 22 patients. In 15 of the 18 episodes of the esophageal disease, there was complete loss of symptoms within 2 wk. Only three of the 15 patients responding to foscarnet therapy had a relapse of their esophageal disease. Two of these patients were successfully retreated with foscarnet. Of the 22 patients receiving foscarnet for CMV colitis, four died during foscarnet therapy. Of the 18 patients completing the course of treatment with foscarnet for first-episode CMV colitis, 11 remitted completely and six had a partial remission. All patients with partial remission had a second pathogen responsible for the continuation of their diarrhea. Only one patient completing a course of foscarnet failed to respond microscopically to treatment. Three patients experienced relapse of their CMV colitis, two of whom responded to further courses of foscarnet. Foscarnet is an effective therapy for CMV disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with rapid resolution of clinical symptoms, long-term remission of esophageal disease, and shorter disease-free periods for CMV colitis. 
Delayed hearing loss after surgery for acoustic neurinomas: clinical and electrophysiological observations. In a series of 26 patients with medium-sized and large acoustic neurinomas and documented hearing before surgery, 7 patients had preservation of hearing initially after the procedure but then developed delayed hearing loss. The most prominent intraoperative electrophysiological finding in these cases was a gradual deterioration of brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), especially of Wave V. Four additional patients with a similar gradual intraoperative loss of BAEP and severe postoperative hearing deterioration received vasoactive treatment after surgery (low-molecular weight dextran). In all 4 patients, including 1 patient with documented total deafness after surgery, hearing was preserved. Initial preservation of cochlear nerve function after the removal of an acoustic neurinoma does not guarantee postoperative hearing. Intraoperative BAEP help to identify patients at risk for delayed postoperative hearing loss. The pathophysiological mechanism can be attributed to disturbances of the microcirculation in endoneurial vasa nervorum caused by the mechanical manipulation of the cochlear nerve. 
Poststenotic dilatation. Partial narrowing of arteries produces poststenotic dilatation. This appears as a dilation of the vessel wall 1 to 3 centimeters distal to the area of a partial stenosis. When a stenotic band is placed in dogs, poststenotic dilatation develops rapidly, often within eight to ten days. Moderate stenoses that produce a bruit and thrill are effective in eliciting poststenotic dilatation, whereas very tight and very mild stenoses usually are ineffective. Thus, development of poststenotic dilatation requires the presence of flow disturbances sufficient to produce an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. Although the exact flow disturbance is uncertain, statis, increased lateral pressure, cavitation, abnormal shear stresses and turbulence all have been postulated to be the cause of poststenotic dilatation. Of these, experimental studies support abnormal shear stresses and turbulence as the most likely causes. Whatever the flow disturbance, it must make the wall vibrate to produce poststenotic dilatation. Vibrations are thought to produce alterations in wall elastin and possibly in vascular smooth muscle tone. This leads to dilatation of the vessel. If the dilatation is slight, removal of the stenosis may cause reversal of poststenotic dilatation with recovery beginning within hours of correction of the stenosis. If the dilated area is enlarged to twice normal diameter, it may exhibit permanent aneurysmal changes and, therefore, requires resections with reanastomosis. Arteries that are dilated to as little as one-third more than normal size may contain areas of ulceration with overlying thrombus. These vessels also may require resection with reanastomosis. 
Relationship between glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of islet cells in chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index. 
Cavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. 
Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations. OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality (from coronary heart disease and from other causes) below the range of cholesterol values generally seen in Western populations. DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a "low" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death. 
Enucleation after plaque radiotherapy for posterior uveal melanoma. Histopathologic findings. A review of 1019 patients with posterior uveal melanomas, who were treated with episcleral plaque radiotherapy between April 1976 and December 1987, showed that 59 (6%) of these patients have thus far required enucleation of the affected eye. The most common clinical reasons for enucleation were tumor regrowth (51%) and neovascular glaucoma (31%). These irradiated melanomas were of mixed cell type in 40 cases (68%), spindle in 10 cases (17%), totally necrotic in 7 cases (12%), and epithelioid in 2 cases (3%). Some degree of tumor necrosis was seen in all cases. Overall, the median number of mitoses per 40 high-power fields in these irradiated tumors was 0. Most (64%) of the tumors had no identifiable mitosis in 40 high-power fields. A three-way simultaneous comparison of the following groups was made: irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth, irradiated eyes enucleated for neovascular glaucoma, and a matched group of nonirradiated posterior uveal melanomas. This comparison showed that the largest tumor dimension was significantly greater in the irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth than in the other two groups. Mitotic activity was significantly higher in the irradiated tumor regrowth and nonirradiated groups than in the irradiated neovascular group. There was no significant difference among the three groups in an analysis of height. The results suggested that mitotic activity may exist after plaque radiotherapy, especially when there is clinical evidence of tumor regrowth. 
Thromboembolism in patients with advanced mitral valve prolapse Thromboembolism in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been suggested to occur in relation to valvular cul-de-sac recesses and endothelial wear-and-tear denudations. Such pathology would be suspected to be prominent in advanced cases of MVP necessitating open-heart operation. We therefore analysed the prevalence of perivalvular thrombi and episodes of systemic arterial embolism (SE) prior to operation in 21 consecutive patients with MVP and severe valve regurgitation. No perivalvular or left atrial thrombi were found during open-heart surgery, but three of the patients (14%, 3-36% with 95% confidence limits) experienced SE, in one case despite long-term anticoagulation. All cases of SE took place less than 3 months before operation. The results indicate that persistent thrombi are rare in MVP and severe valve regurgitation. However, such patients run a substantial risk of SE when they reach a clinical and haemodynamic stage that makes valve surgery mandatory. 
A mathematical computer stimulation model for the development of colonic polyps and colon cancer. Currently known information about the development and progression of colon polyps and cancer is summarized and organized into a mathematical computer simulation model that successfully predicts the natural history of colon polyp and cancer development for an average patient with (1) familial polyposis coli (2) genetic susceptibility as measured by a positive family history, and (3) negative family history with a high fat diet. The mathematical model uses four distinct types of cells (normal, transformed, polypoid, and cancerous) and two kinetic processes (mutation and promotion). Arachidonic acid metabolites play a role in the model in the promotion of cancer from polyps, and account for that promotion through: (1) their effect on encouraging more polypoid cells in mitosis to move toward cancer; and (2) their immunosuppressive effect over time. The model also shows that one defect in allowing more cells to mutate to the transformed state is sufficient to account for the chain of events leading to the clinical sequelae of familial polyposis coli. A second genetic effect at another point in the process is unnecessary. The mechanism of action of Sulindac on colon polyps is explained by the model through inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites, most notably prostaglandin E. 
Sepsis. What it is and how to recognize it. Sepsis, shock, and resuscitation may result in various degrees of ischemia-perfusion injury that may produce widespread organ dysfunction through complex interactions and activation of host immunoinflammatory processes. As the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the inflammatory response are better defined, we may be able to modulate the generalized inflammatory state we know as sepsis and prevent the development of multiple organ failure syndrome. At present, however, the mainstay of therapy remains prompt resuscitation to eliminate regions of hypoperfusion and to limit as much as possible those factors that predispose to further organ injury while the source of inflammatory stimulation is being identified and controlled. 
Membrane cerebral lipids in Rett syndrome. The lipid membrane composition of cerebral tissue from 5 patients with classic Rett syndrome, ages 12-30 years, and from 14 age-matched controls was studied. The results demonstrated a selective loss of myelin-associated lipids and an enrichment of gangliosides in temporal white matter. The ganglioside pattern revealed an increase of astroglial cell-associated gangliosides and reduced proportions of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. This latter finding may be crucial in synaptic function. The fatty acid compositions of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride, choline phosphoglyceride, and galactosylceramide were normal. 
Thyroid adenocarcinomas secondary to tissue-specific expression of simian virus-40 large T-antigen in transgenic mice. A hybrid gene comprising the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter and the coding region for the simian virus-40 large T- and small t-antigens was used to generate 30 transgenic mice by microinjection into the pronuclei of single cell embryos. All animals except three developed, as single primitive pathology, a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid gland. Compression of trachea and esophagus, accompanied by dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia, led to a progressive cachexia and premature death attributed to respiratory failure. Despite the large thyroid volume, T4 levels were abnormally low, and the progression of the syndrome could be delayed by a substitutive treatment with thyroid hormones. The rapid evolution of the disease, leading to the death of most founder transgenic animals before the breeding age, prevented transmission of the transgene to their offspring. Only two transgenic lines are presently surviving. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues revealed a specific expression of the simian virus-40 antigens in the thyroid cells. Hyperplasia was already obvious at birth. Older animals displayed moderately to poorly differentiated thyroid adenocarcinomas. Electron microscopy revealed, however, the persistence of cell polarity and the presence of microfollicles between the densely packed cells. Cell lines derived from these large T-expressing thyroids were shown to have lost expression of both thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase, while expressing low levels of TSH receptors. These transgenic mice could constitute an interesting model of aggressive adenocarcinoma, sharing phenotypical similarities with the anaplastic type of human thyroid tumors. 
A phase I trial of high-dose diaziquone and autologous bone marrow transplantation: an Illinois Cancer Council study. Diaziquone (AZQ), a synthetic quinone with demonstrated activity against acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), primary CNS tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), is virtually devoid of nonhematopoietic toxicity at conventional doses. As a prelude to its inclusion into bone marrow transplant (BMT) preparative regimens, a phase I study of high-dose AZQ with autologous BMT (ABMT) was performed. Patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas were treated with a single 24-hour infusion of AZQ at 50 to 355 mg/m2 in dose escalations of 20%. Fifty-six patients received 69 courses. Those receiving greater than 60 mg/m2 had nadir granulocyte and platelet counts less than 500/microL and 20,000/microL, respectively. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhea were mild, transient, and not dose-related. Transient minimal elevations of liver function tests were seen in five patients and were also not dose-related. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose AZQ was found to be 245 mg/m2, with nephrotoxicity being dose-limiting. Significant azotemia was seen in four of 12 patients treated at 295 and 355 mg/m2, including fatal anuric renal failure in three of these patients. Reversible proteinuria also occurred in 24 of 26 courses above 150 mg/m2, including nephrotic range proteinuria in eight courses, all at doses of 205 to 355 mg/m2. The proteinuria was also associated with multiple proximal tubular defects including generalized aminoaciduria and proximal renal tubular acidosis. There were six early deaths including two of early renal failure (295 and 355 mg/m2), two of sepsis (205 and 245 mg/m2), one of a pulmonary embolus (85 mg/m2), and one of progressive disease (60 mg/m2). Of 50 patients who were assessable for response, there were seven responses including two of 10 with primary CNS tumors, one of 12 with malignant melanoma, one of five with non-small-cell lung carcinoma, two of two with breast carcinoma, and one of one with ovarian carcinoma. Because of its activity in ANLL and NHL and its unique toxicity spectrum, high-dose AZQ may improve the efficacy of current BMT preparative regimens without significantly increasing their nonhematopoietic toxicity. 
Use of purified streptokinase in empyema and hemothorax. Enzymatic debridement of the pleural cavity for retained hemothorax or empyema is a frequently overlooked option. Thirteen of fourteen patients (93%) with retained pleural collections underwent successful enzymatic debridement and tube drainage with purified streptokinase injections. The average increase in chest tube output following streptokinase injections was 158%. No significant adverse reactions occurred. One patient required thoracotomy when streptokinase therapy failed. Two others had successful resolution of their pleural collections but required thoracotomy for other indications. There were two deaths (14%), which were unrelated to the use of streptokinase or residual empyema. Intrapleural streptokinase is a safe, effective means of removing retained proteinaceous collections in the pleural space. It is a useful adjunct to chest tube drainage and may obviate the need for more invasive procedures. 
Sexual function and testosterone levels in men with nonalcoholic liver disease. The effects of nonalcoholic liver disease on sexual desire, arousal, activity, orgasmic function and satisfaction and serum testosterone levels were studied in 75 men with nonalcoholic liver disease. Each man was interviewed about his sexual behavior and problems and was asked to comment on whether he felt liver disease affected his sexual function. The average age of the patients was 49 yr, and a wide variety of liver diseases was represented. Child-Pugh grading was A in 51 patients, B in 18 and C in 6; the mean duration of liver disease was 8 yr. Sexual desire, arousal and activity of patients with grade A disease were within the ranges observed in studies of healthy men of comparable age. Diminished sexual desire was reported by 2% of grade A patients and 35% of grade B and C patients (p less than 0.005). Arousal problems were noted by 16% of grade A patients, 60% of grade B patients and 67% of C patients (p less than 0.005). Loss of erection and inability to regain erection were noted by 7%, 40% and 67% of grade A, B and C patients, respectively (p less than 0.01). Premature and retarded ejaculation were more frequent in patients classed in Child-Pugh grades B and C. Frequency of coitus and orgasm were significantly higher in grade A patients than in grade B and C patients. Total and free testosterone levels were (in nanograms per milliliter) A, 677/1.78; B, 416/1.06; and C, 178/0.43 (p less than 0.002). We concluded that Child-Pugh grade A nonalcoholic liver disease in men does not affect sexual desire, function or performance. Men with disease grades B and C have significant sexual dysfunction and significant reduction of both total and free testosterone levels. 
Lymphography--current role in oncology. A review of the use of lymphography at this hospital, a major oncology centre, is presented. The advent of computed tomography has brought a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphograms currently performed for diseases such as lymphoma, testicular tumours and gynaecological malignancies. This study analyses the reasons for this decline, and concludes that valuable information can still be obtained from lymphography in certain selected groups of patients. 
CT of the pancreas in children. CT has become a frequently used imaging method for evaluating suspected pancreatic disease in children. Although the spectrum of CT findings in pancreatic disease is well documented in adults, there is a paucity of such information in children. Familiarity with CT patterns of pancreatic disease in childhood is important for diagnosis. In this essay, we illustrate the CT findings of pancreatic lesions in children. 
Spontaneous hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with hereditary hepatitis. A model of Wilson's disease. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an inbred strain of a mutant rat isolated from Long-Evans rats, develop hereditary hepatitis. To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans. 
Comparison of continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion plus either continuous epidural infusion or patient-controlled epidural injection of fentanyl for postoperative analgesia. We compared the postoperative epidural analgesia provided by the continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine supplemented with patient-controlled injection (PCA) of epidural fentanyl with that provided by a continuous infusion of bupivacaine supplemented with a continuous epidural infusion of fentanyl. Our patient population comprised 16 ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing laparotomy with a midline incision under general anesthesia combined with bupivacaine epidural analgesia. Post-operatively, a continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine (0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1) was combined with epidural fentanyl given by either (a) PCA (15-micrograms bolus with a lockout interval of 12 min, n = 8) or (b) continuous infusion (1 microgram.kg-1.h-1, n = 8). In the case of inadequate pain relief in the latter group, the fentanyl infusion rate was increased by 10 micrograms/h. Analgesia evaluated by a visual analogue pain score and by a verbal pain score was similarly effective in both groups. The sedation score was also similar in both groups. The total dose of epidural fentanyl administered during the first 24 h was significantly lower in the PCA group than in the continuous infusion group (405 +/- 110 micrograms vs 1600 +/- 245 micrograms, P less than 0.001). The dose of fentanyl given during each 4-h interval ranged between 40 and 160 micrograms in the PCA group and 251 and 292 micrograms in the continuous infusion group. Clinically detectable respiratory depression was not observed in either group. In conclusion, epidural administration of 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 bupivacaine combined with fentanyl provides effective postoperative analgesia with a total dose of fentanyl required that is lower when fentanyl is administered by epidural PCA rather than by continuous epidural infusion. 
Staging relationships and outcome in early stage testicular cancer: a report from the Testicular Cancer Intergroup Study. The Testicular Cancer Center Intergroup Study entered surgically staged patients with nonseminomatous tumor and metastases limited to the regional lymph nodes into a previously reported cooperative trial of immediate versus delayed therapy for positive retroperitoneal node disease. Patients with negative nodes (stage I) were placed in an observation registry with specified treatment strategy upon relapse. Of 264 stage I cancer patients 27 (10.2%) had recurrence: 5 of these 27 patients died after recurrence of the testicular malignancies, while 4 other nontumor-related deaths have occurred. Pre-lymphadenectomy staging characteristics observed to predict significantly node positivity are the results of radiological examinations, presence of tumor invasion, vascular invasion and tumor histology. In a multiple logistic regression analysis with these variables, misclassification still occurs in more than a fourth of the patients. Future refinements in diagnosis may allow for better prediction of these patients at risk to have positive lymph nodes and ultimately recurrence. Presently, if assessment of nodal involvement is the objective, noninvasive procedures are not an adequate substitute for surgical staging with modified lymphadenectomy. 
The detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBsAG negative individuals with primary liver cancer. The importance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of primary liver cancer has been established by epidemiological studies. However, the evidence for a direct role of the virus in liver carcinogenesis is still tentative. In addition, the findings of HBV DNA sequences in HBsAg-negative subjects with liver cancer has been reported, although it is controversial. Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA in the serum and liver of HBsAg-negative patients. This technique allows both for the detection and cloning of HBV variants. In addition, the demonstration of HBV DNA and RNA molecules in HCC of HBsAg-negative individuals as determined by standard techniques reinforces the role of HBV in the pathogenesis of this tumor. 
Results of fundoplication in a UK paediatric centre. Of 55 children (age 3 months to 16 years) who had fundoplication, major complications occurred in nine (16 per cent): paraoesophageal hernia (five cases), prolonged ileus (two cases), recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux (one case), and accidental perforation (one case). The single most important factor resulting in complications was the omission of crural repair; of seven patients without crural repair, five developed paraoesophageal hernia/recurrence. Four patients required repeat fundoplication for severe recurrent symptoms and one of these developed the unusual complication of pericardiogastric fistula. Thirteen patients had strictures before operation from reflux oesophagitis, six (46 per cent) resolved after fundoplication alone, six responded to dilatation (mean five sessions), and one required colon interposition. Our preliminary experience with balloon dilatation was encouraging: three of three patients responded after one dilatation only. These results confirmed the efficacy of surgery in controlling reflux: 100 per cent in the short-term and 89 per cent on a 1-6 year follow-up. Major complications might well be reduced by routine crural repair. 
Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, a new, selective, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The effect of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 84 patients undergoing gynecologic operation and receiving the same general anesthetic. The patients received premedication with either 16 mg oral ondansetron, or a matching placebo. The same medication was given postoperatively 8 h after the first dose. During the first hour after recovery from anesthesia, the frequencies of nausea and vomiting were 52% and 40%, respectively, in patients given placebos. In the ondansetron group nausea and vomiting developed in 17% and 12%, respectively, values significantly different from those with placebos (P less than 0.005). Similar differences were observed throughout the entire 24-h period after recovery, the incidence of nausea and vomiting being 67% and 60%, respectively, in the placebo group and 29% and 26% in the ondansetron treatment group. Ondansetron appears to be a promising antiemetic for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
Method for auditing turnround time in histopathology related to user requirements. Histopathology audit schemes have concentrated on the accuracy of diagnosis or the standard of technical work. The most appropriate measure of specimen report time for histopathology was assessed. The simplest method is to calculate the mean or median number of days from receipt of specimens to issue of report, but this takes no account of clinical practice. An alternative approach is to compare the laboratory's performance with the clinicians' requirements. Clinicians were invited to complete a questionnaire specifying the reporting times they required subdivided by tissue type, clinical suspicion of malignancy, and bed occupancy of the patient. The questionnaire showed that there were distinct differences in clinicians' requirements. The turnround time for each category of specimen was calculated and expressed in three ways. The traditional method of quoting a median value showed very few differences among the categories. A comparison of the department's performance with the clinicians' requirements, using an arbitrary cut-off point of satisfying at least 80% of the clinicians' most stringent requirements or an achievement index, however, provided useful information for refining laboratory priorities. 
Histological grading of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis: a new scoring system. A system of histological grading based on retrospective analysis of 239 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is presented. A new scoring system with 4 histological grades was used. The results of this study confirm previous reports that penile cancer is usually a highly (50%) or moderately (29%) differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare. The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established. Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored. 
Incidence and treatment of rejection episodes in primary orthotopic liver transplantation under FK 506. FK 506 therapy with low doses of steroids was adequate to control rejection in most liver recipients. Rejection episodes were readily reversed with single IV doses of methylprednisone or hydrocortisone. Short courses of OKT3 (3 to 5 days 5-10 mL) controlled severe rejections. The rate of retransplantation directly due to rejection was low (1.6%). There was a limited need for steroids either early or out to 6 to 12 months. 
Evaluating genetic association among ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer: evidence for a breast/ovarian cancer relationship. The possibility of a genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was investigated in data from a large multicenter, population-based, case-control study, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for mothers and sisters of 493 ovarian cancer cases, 895 breast cancer cases, and 143 endometrial cancer cases versus 4,754 controls were calculated. Significantly elevated age-adjusted RRs were found for ovarian cancer (RR = 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-4.9) and breast cancer (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) among relatives of ovarian cancer probands and for breast cancer (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.7-2.5) and ovarian cancer (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) among relatives of breast cancer probands. Relatives of endometrial cancer probands had an elevated RR for endometrial cancer only (RR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8). The genetic relationship between ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer was tested using a multivariate polygenic threshold model developed by Smith (1976), which was modified to accommodate three classes of probands. Estimates of heritability for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer were 40%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. There was a significant genetic correlation between ovarian and breast cancer (R12 = .484). Evidence for significant genetic overlap between endometrial cancer and either ovarian or breast cancer was not found. These results suggest the existence of a familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Endometrial cancer, while heritable, appears to be genetically unrelated. 
Concomitant whole-abdominal radiation and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma. A pilot study. Because the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma has not significantly improved 5-year survival rates compared with either whole-abdominal radiation (WAR) or single-agent chemotherapy, a pilot study was begun to assess the feasibility of concomitant radiation and chemotherapy. Eleven previously untreated patients with Stages III and IV ovarian carcinoma were treated concomitantly with 2000 cGy of WAR and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by additional IP cisplatin after debulking surgery. Toxicity was moderate to severe. Sixty-four percent of patients had Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity, and 36% required hospitalization for sepsis during WAR/IP cisplatin. Hematologic toxicity was less pronounced during IP cisplatin alone. All patients experienced moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. The average percentage of total body weight lost was 13.5%. Fifty-five percent of all patients demonstrated a complete clinical response to therapy, and patients with minimal postoperative residual disease fared better. One patient with persistent disease had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 24 months after initial diagnosis. No patients with residual disease greater than 20 mm survived, while 50% of patients with less than 20 mm are clinically free of disease. Toxicity appears to be additive with the combination of WAR and IP cisplatin. Therapeutic efficacy was comparable with standard chemotherapy regimens, but no therapeutic or survival advantages were demonstrated with the use of this treatment protocol. 
Chagas' heart disease in the United States. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Chagas' heart disease is believed to be rare in the United States, although many persons from countries where the disease is endemic reside here. We performed a retrospective case review and prospective follow-up of 25 patients with Chagas' heart disease and no obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography. RESULTS. The patients mainly presented with symptomatic atrioventricular block, congestive heart failure, anginal chest pain, sudden death averted by resuscitation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of the 25 patients, 18 had been treated for coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy for up to 108 months before the diagnosis of Chagas' disease was considered. The electrocardiograms frequently suggested coronary artery disease. Six of the seven patients who had exercise thallium-perfusion scans had abnormalities suggesting ischemia or infarction. A left ventricular aneurysm was found in 14 of the 25 patients, segmental akinesia or hypokinesia in 5, and diffuse hypokinesia in 3. Programmed ventricular stimulation performed in 13 patients induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in 9 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 2. Actuarial survival (mean +/- SE) after four years for the entire group was 56 +/- 12 percent; it was 32 +/- 16 percent among those with global left ventricular dysfunction, and 78 +/- 14 percent among those without such dysfunction (P = 0.03). Only patients with left ventricular dysfunction or an aneurysm died (four-year survival, 45 +/- 14 percent, as compared with 100 percent for the remaining patients; P = 0.0002). Heart failure and left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction were the only independent predictors of death. Nine patients required permanent pacemakers. CONCLUSIONS. In the United States, Chagas' heart disease commonly mimics coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The prognosis is poor for patients with heart failure or left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction. The disease may be underdiagnosed in the United States. 
Effect of thrombolysis on the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Patients with late potentials in the signal averaged electrocardiogram are more at risk of lethal arrhythmias in the period after acute myocardial infarction. To test the effects of thrombolysis on the incidence and evolution of late potentials, 158 consecutive patients were prospectively studied during the first 10 days after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of two groups: 93 control patients treated conservatively and 65 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Recordings of signal averaged electrocardiogram were obtained within two days and 7-10 days after infarction. The incidence of late potentials in the first two days after infarction was not significantly different in the thrombolytic and control groups (14% v 11.8%). By 7-10 days the incidence of late potentials among patients who underwent thrombolysis remained unchanged (14%); however, it increased significantly in the control group (11.8% to 22.5%). Thus thrombolysis seems to reduce the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Because the risk of fatal arrhythmias is higher in patients with late potentials this study may partly explain the reduced mortality after thrombolysis. 
The persistence of symptoms in patients with globus pharyngis. A follow-up study of 104 patients with globus sensation was performed by postal questionnaire. All were asked to complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and a 12-item Throat Symptom Questionnaire. Seventy-two of these patients were sent a follow-up General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Replies were received from 89 patients (86%), 68 females and 21 males, a mean of 31 months after initial presentation. The feeling of something stuck in the throat had disappeared completely in 27% of patients, but only 4% were never aware of the throat. Throat symptoms showed a reduction with increasing age, but not with increasing interval since presentation. The 15 patients initially treated with antacid therapy had significantly greater dyspepsia scores at review than untreated patients, but no other difference was found between the two groups. GHQ scores showed a small but significant reduction over time. Of EPQ parameters, only the lower lie score in female patients showed any significant difference on repeat testing. Those with persistently high throat scores had significantly lower EPQ lie scores and a trend towards higher GHQ scores at follow-up. None of the psychological parameters measured at the first interview was found to be of prognostic significance. We conclude that, although there is a reduction in occult psychiatric morbidity in patients with the globus sensation over time, underlying personality traits remain stable and that there is a remarkable persistence of pharyngeal symptoms. 
Risks associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. Among 58,187 women tested, 1002 had a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measuring greater than or equal to 2.5 multiples of the median after correction for race, weight, and insulin-dependent diabetes. They were stratified into three groups: group 1, 2.5 to 2.9; group 2, 3.0 to 5.0; group 3, greater than or equal to 5.0 multiples of the median. The initial risk of a serious abnormality detected by ultrasonography or amniocentesis was 17% (5%, 12% and 65% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). After correction for twins and dates, this risk became 23% (7%, 18%, and 71% in groups, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Among the women with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, 556 (77%) had normal ultrasonographic and amniocentesis studies, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome ws 27% (19%, 29%, and 70% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in late fetal and perinatal death, prematurity and growth retardation, oligohydramnios, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, and congenital abnormalities. The overall risk for abnormality or adverse outcome was 24% in group 1, 41% in group 2, and 91% in group 3. 
Epidemiologic correlates of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We evaluated 74 selected patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 201 matched controls for risk factors for ALS by a case-control design and a sequential questionnaire/interview technique to quantitate biographic data. We analyzed occupational and recreational data only for 47 male patients and 47 corresponding patient controls; data for women were insufficient. We used nonparametric analyses to evaluate five primary comparisons of ALS patients with controls: (1) more hard physical labor, p not significant (NS); (2) greater frequency of neurodegenerative disease in family members, p NS; (3) greater exposure to lead, p less than 0.05; (4) more years lived in a rural community, p NS; and (5) more trauma or major surgery, p NS. Men with ALS had worked more frequently at blue-collar jobs (although not a statistically significant difference, p = 0.10) and at welding or soldering (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that there may be an association between ALS in men and exposure to lead vapor. The limited nature of the association favors a multifactorial etiologic mechanism of ALS. 
Catechol metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid as possible markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This paper is a preliminary report of work aiming to elucidate the possible use of 5-S-cysteinyl metabolites of catechols in the cerebrospinal fluid as markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The rationale for this approach is the hypothesis that this disorder is caused by a failure of antioxidative mechanisms to prevent the excessive autoxidation of dopamine and other catechols that yields highly reactive and cytotoxic semiquinones and quinones. 5-S-cysteinyl adducts of these quinones have been detected in human brains, analyzed postmortem, and appear to be formed at an increased rate in elderly individuals, who show an increased loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
Shortlasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, and subclinical forehead sweating ("Sunct" syndrome): II. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure during pain paroxysms. The recently described "Sunct" syndrome is a rare picture of unilateral, shortlasting headache attacks accompanied by autonomic phenomena (conjunctival injection, tearing, etc.) on the symptomatic side. Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored in two elderly "Sunct" patients during and outside headache attacks. An ultrasound Doppler servo method was used for the non-invasive, continuous, beat-to-beat determination of instantaneous arterial blood pressure. In a third patient, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both outside and during pain paroxysms, were assessed using the standard Korotkoff method. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased during pain paroxysms. Systolic blood pressure was observed to be significantly increased during attacks, when compared with the inter-attack period, while a less consistent pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure. Some of the changes in the cardiovascular system seemed to start prior to pain onset. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these changes were caused by pain activation of the sympathetic nervous system or the oculocardiac reflex. 
Dementia presenting with aphasia: clinical characteristics. Dementia, a disorder of multiple cognitive functions, may atypically present as an aphasia. The clinical characteristics are reported of 13 patients with up to 14 years of progressive language impairment before developing dementia. In reviewing the literature, it was found that these patients were similar to those reported with progressive aphasia. It is concluded that dementia may present with an anomic, dysfluent language disorder due to the focal left sylvian onset of several dementing illnesses. 
Hypertrophy of nodules of Arantius and aortic insufficiency: pathophysiology and repair. Aortic insufficiency (AI) due to fibrosis and thickening of the nodules of Arantius in the otherwise normal aortic valve was found in 11 adults (age range, 41 to 65 years) between 1976 and 1988. Nine had concomitant mitral stenosis; 2 had coronary artery disease. In 6 patients AI was graded 3+ or greater; in 5 it was less than 3+. Correction of AI and restoration of cuspid flexibility and apposition by shaving the hypertrophied nodules was accomplished in all, with postrepair AI graded as 1+ or less. There was one hospital death, a patient who had prior mitral operation. Mean follow-up was 68 +/- 56 months. Only 1 patient had late (6 years) recurrent serious (3+) AI. Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months. We conclude that thickening of the nodules of Arantius may cause AI. Long-term correction can be accomplished by sculpturing of the involved cusps. 
Seasonal variations in fibrinogen concentrations among elderly people. Mortality and morbidity in elderly people are higher in winter than in summer months, with seasonal variations in rates of both fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. To identify factors that might contribute to the excess winter frequency of cardiovascular disease in the elderly, we studied 100 subjects aged 75 and over who lived in either their own homes or in sheltered or residential accommodation. Each person was visited each month for one year, body and environmental temperatures were noted, and cardiovascular risk factors were measured. 32 subjects withdrew from the study. Significant seasonal effects were found for fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, and HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.003, Bonferroni adjustment). Plasma fibrinogen concentrations showed the greatest seasonal change and were 23% higher in the coldest six months compared with summer months. Fibrinogen was significantly (p less than 0.05) and negatively related to core body temperature and all measures of environmental temperature. Those living in institutions had greater changes in plasma fibrinogen than those living in the community. The seasonal variation in plasma fibrinogen concentration is large enough to increase the risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke in winter. 
Role of neurohumoral systems for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy in experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis in rats. We studied the role of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 135 rats with experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS). We induced this condition by a silver clip on the ascending aorta, when body weight (BW) was 90 to 100 g. Sympathectomy by 6-OH-dopamine reduced LV norepinephrine content to less than 5%. The renin-angiotensin system was blocked by quinapril, which reduced serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity to less than 5%. Aortic stenosis (LV peak systolic pressure 212 +/- 10 mm Hg) induced significant LVH with an increase of LV weight from 198 +/- 3 (sham) to 266 +/- 6 after 6 weeks and to 303 +/- 13 mg/100 g body weight after 12 weeks. Sympathectomy did not reduce LVH 6 weeks after induction of AS (260 +/- 6 mg/100 g body weight). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition initiated immediately after induction of AS did not alter the increase of LV mass after 6 weeks (250 +/- 7 mg/100 g body weight). Removing the silver clip 6 weeks after induction of AS resulted in a 90% regression of LVH after 6 more weeks. When ACE-inhibition was started after 6 weeks--ie, once LVH had developed--and maintained for another 6 weeks, an 80% regression of LVH was observed despite the persistent afterload elevation. Our findings of an afterload independent regression of LVH by ACE-inhibition emphasize an important role of the renin angiotensin system for the maintenance of pressure induced LVH. 
Acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in a hospital population in Warsaw, Poland: clinical and epidemiological aspects. In the years 1986-1988, 530 consecutive cases of acute viral hepatitis were admitted to an infectious disease hospital in Warsaw. Hepatitis A was diagnosed in 34 cases (6.4%), hepatitis B in 436 (82.3%), CMV infection in five (0.9%), and 55 cases (10.4%) were classified as hepatitis non-A, non-B. In 47 cases (85%) of non-A, non-B hepatitis, there was evidence of parenteral transmission, whereas in eight (15%), the source of infection was unknown. Chronic liver disease developed in 50% of patients with parenteral exposure, but there were no cases with known exposure. Seroconversion to anti-HCV was observed only in patients with parenteral exposure, and 60% of followed up cases developed antibodies within 6 months. 
Abdominal abscess due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans. A case of abdominal abscess and bacteremia due to Cardiobacterium hominis and Clostridium bifermentans was successfully treated with surgical drainage and ampicillin-penicillin. This case represents the rare occurrence of C. hominis infection without apparent endocarditis. 
9-[(2RS)-3-fluoro-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] derivatives of purines: a class of highly selective antiretroviral agents in vitro and in vivo. A new class of compounds, 9-[(2RS)-3-fluoro-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] [(RS)-FPMP] derivatives of purines, is described that has selective activity against a broad spectrum of retroviruses [including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2)] but not other RNA or DNA viruses. This activity spectrum is completely different from that of the parental compounds, 9-[(2S)-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl] [(S)-HPMP] derivatives of purines, which are active against a broad range of DNA viruses. The racemic (RS)-FPMP derivatives of adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine, termed (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP, respectively, are markedly more selective as in vitro antiretroviral agents than their 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) (PME) counterparts, PMEA and PMEDAP. Also, (RS)-FPMPA and (RS)-FPMPDAP have a substantially higher therapeutic index in mice in inhibiting Moloney murine sarcoma virus-induced tumor formation and associated death and are markedly less inhibitory to human bone marrow cells than PMEA and PMEDAP. The diphosphate derivative of (RS)-FPMPA [(RS)-FPMPApp] is a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but not of HSV-1 DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase alpha. (RS)-FPMPApp, akin to PMEA diphosphate (PMEApp), acts as a DNA chain terminator. The DNA chain-terminating properties of PMEApp and (RS)-FPMPApp seem to be a prerequisite for acyclic nucleoside phosphonates to exhibit antiretrovirus (i.e., anti-HIV) activity. 
The contribution of salvage surgery to the management of childhood osteosarcoma. Between January 1970 and December 1988, 174 consecutive patients under the age of 20 years with curatively resected primary osteosarcoma were treated at our institute; 72 in the years of 1970 to 1981 and 102 in the years 1982 to 1988. In the latter period, adjuvant chemotherapy was replaced by neoadjuvant programs, and new criteria were adopted for the management of lung metastases, consisting in early bilateral surgical staging and lung resection through median sternotomy for all patients with purely intrathoracic relapse. Follow-up was updated in December 1989. During the last period, the overall 5-year survival improved significantly from 35% to 58% (P less than .001). The disease-free survival rose from 38% to 45% at 5 years, with median values of 15 months versus 33 months, while the frequency of isolated lung metastases dropped from 58% to the actuarial 48%. The proportion of patients who underwent complete resections of their pulmonary metastases rose from 17% (seven of 42) to 55% (27 of 49), without operative mortality. Due to such a high proportion of patients eligible for salvage surgery, the overall survival from detection of lung metastases improved from 0% to 28% at 5 years (P less than .001). Contralateral occult metastases were resected in three of 15 subjects with monolateral clinical lesions, and five patients underwent subsequent lung resections. These data indicate that systematic bilateral pulmonary resection plays an important role in improving the final cure rate of childhood osteosarcoma, beyond the benefit resulting from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Antiperistaltic and isoperistaltic intussusception associated with abnormal motility after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a case report. Antiperistaltic and recurrent intussusceptions are extremely rare in the adult. We report a patient with both. The patient developed an antiperistaltic intussusception distal to her Roux enteroenterostomy years after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. The diagnosis was made preoperatively with gastrointestinal contrast radiography and ultrasonography. At surgery, the intussusception was reduced, and 12 inches of nonviable bowel was resected, with a functional end-to-end anastomosis. An isoperistaltic intussusception occurred in the early postoperative period just distal to the anastomosis. Manometric evaluation of the Roux limb after the second operation showed altered gastrointestinal motility, consisting of orad-propagated and aboard-propagated migrating motor complexes, minimal phase 2 activity, and lack of conversion to the fed pattern with a liquid meal. Although manometry was not performed before the development of the intussusception, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered intestinal motility may contribute to the development of intussusception. 
Controlled clinical trials of drug treatment for hypertension. A review. We reviewed the designs and major results of 17 large-scale, controlled, clinical trials that reported the effects of drug treatment for hypertension on morbidity or mortality. Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other "hypertensive" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered. 
Risk factors for febrile seizures in the People's Republic of China: a case control study. A case control study was conducted to investigate the association of family history of febrile seizures (FS) and history of maternal, pregnancy and delivery, and postnatal factors with FS. Information was gathered by door-to-door survey in six major cities in the People's Republic of China. Factors present before the date of onset of FS were assessed in 182 subjects and in an equal number of controls matched for age, sex, and geographic area. The odds ratio for risk of FS in children with a family history of FS in a first-degree relative was 10.0 (confidence interval 2.7-58.6), confirming other observations that familial factors are an important predisposing characteristic for FS. Maternal acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy was slightly more frequent in children with FS (odds ratio, 1.9 confidence interval 1.0-3.9). None of the other examined pregnancy or delivery factors was associated with an increased risk, suggesting that birth history is not an important factor predisposing to FS. 
Risks associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. Among 58,187 women tested, 1002 had a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measuring greater than or equal to 2.5 multiples of the median after correction for race, weight, and insulin-dependent diabetes. They were stratified into three groups: group 1, 2.5 to 2.9; group 2, 3.0 to 5.0; group 3, greater than or equal to 5.0 multiples of the median. The initial risk of a serious abnormality detected by ultrasonography or amniocentesis was 17% (5%, 12% and 65% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). After correction for twins and dates, this risk became 23% (7%, 18%, and 71% in groups, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Among the women with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, 556 (77%) had normal ultrasonographic and amniocentesis studies, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome ws 27% (19%, 29%, and 70% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in late fetal and perinatal death, prematurity and growth retardation, oligohydramnios, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, and congenital abnormalities. The overall risk for abnormality or adverse outcome was 24% in group 1, 41% in group 2, and 91% in group 3. 
Mentally retarded individuals--a population at risk? When comparing the aging process of mentally retarded (MR) persons with the nondisabled population, researchers have established an earlier lower limit for the onset of old age for MR persons and a higher mortality rate. The reason for early senescence has not been successfully resolved, but the finding that cardiovascular disorders are the most prevalent form of disease among elderly MR persons suggests a relationship between lifestyles and higher mortality rate. Indeed, studies that evaluated the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of MR individuals demonstrated substandard levels of fitness. The results of these studies, however, are not conclusive due to variation in test methodologies, motivational factors, and issues of test validity and reliability. Training studies which have purported to determine trainability of this population have also shown confusing results, perhaps attributed to the same protocol inconsistencies. Therefore, the purposes of this article are 1) to review previous methods of evaluating CVF of MR adults and determine whether testing methodologies invalidate the results of these studies, 2) to review training studies involving adult MR individuals and determine whether this population is capable of improving their CVF, and 3) to identify areas where further research is needed to fully describe the functional cardiovascular characteristics of MR adults. 
Accordion effect in tortuous right coronary arteries during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Coronary spasm and intimal dissection are well-known complications of coronary angioplasty with potentially serious consequences. Their treatments are different and need to be instituted quickly to prevent vessel closure. We report two cases of mechanical deformation caused by the angioplasty hardware masquerading as dissection or spasm during coronary angioplasty of tortuous native right coronary arteries. 
A technique to accurately construct a contact dressing. We describe a technique to rapidly and accurately construct the contact layer of a composite dressing. This technique is simple to perform and is suitable for any open wound. It is especially useful for moderately sized wounds created during extirpation of tumors by Mohs micrographic surgery. 
Preperitoneal approach for hernia repair: clinical application in pediatric urology. The preperitoneal approach for inguinal hernia repair rarely is indicated in children. However, we report on its clinical usefulness for children in whom the perivesical space must be exposed, such as during surgical repair of bladder exstrophy, ureterocele and ureteral reimplantation. This approach allows for a true high ligation of the hernia sac, and the repair is safe, fast and effective. 
Colon perforation during colonoscopy: surgical versus conservative management. A survey of endoscopy units in the West Midlands, UK, was undertaken to ascertain the management of colonic perforation during colonoscopy. Fifteen perforations were reported from a total of 17,500 colonoscopies performed in 14 units (a rate of 0.09 per cent). In seven patients the diagnosis was suspected or diagnosed immediately and in the remaining eight 2-72 h later. Four patients with associated pathology (carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and a polyp) had resection and primary anastomosis. Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis. In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment. Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy. There was no significant morbidity following treatment. It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma. 
Pathologic correlates of survival in 378 lymph node-negative infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas. Mitotic count is the best single predictor. Pathologic features of 378 breast carcinomas without axillary lymph node metastases were correlated with long-term prognosis. Mitotic count, the feature best predicting prognosis, was most useful at lower mitotic count levels than usually studied. Cases with less than 4.5 mitotic figures per ten high-power fields had a 20-year tumor-related survival of 73% versus 48% for those with higher mitotic counts. Low and high mitotic count groups had significantly different prognoses for T1c, T2, and T3 tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that the best combination of features predicting tumor-related death were high mitotic count (relative risk, x 2.8), large tumor size (relative risk, x 1.7), lymphatic invasion (relative risk, x 1.7), and skin or subjacent muscle or chest wall invasion (relative risk, x 2.5). Nuclear grade, Bloom-Richardson grade, modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade, Fisher's grade, and necrosis correlated well with survival but had no significant additional predictive value when adjusted for the mitotic count. 
Isolation of group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter species from Thai children with diarrhea. Campylobacter species were isolated from 93 (15%) of 631 Thai children with diarrhea using the membrane filter technique on nonselective blood agar incubated at 37 degrees C. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 62 (10%), Campylobacter coli from 14 (2%), and atypical campylobacters from 17 (3%). The 17 atypical strains were first characterized biochemically and by dot blot DNA hybridization. Catalase-negative strains also were characterized by DNA hybridization and ribotype pattern. One strain was a catalase-negative "Campylobacter upsaliensis" and another was a nitrate-negative Campylobacter jejuni doylei. Fifteen isolates were aerotolerant strains most closely resembling Campylobacter cryaerophila or "C. upsaliensis" by dot hybridization. These aerotolerant strains, designated group 2 ("Campylobacter butzleri"), had ribotypes distinct from C. cryaerophila and have previously been shown to be related by DNA hybridization at the species level to the group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter type strain (D2686). Group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter were the atypical Campylobacter species most frequently isolated from Thai children with diarrhea. 
Limb vascular responsiveness to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation in patients with congestive heart failure. BACKGROUND. In patients with congestive heart failure, the chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenergic agonists are reduced. It is not known whether desensitization of peripheral beta-adrenoceptors accounts for impaired limb vasodilation in these patients. Accordingly, we studied 14 normal subjects and 13 age-matched patients with congestive heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. To distinguish vasodilation mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase from that mediated by stimulation of guanylate cyclase, each subject received intrabrachial artery infusions of isoproterenol (1-100 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (0.3-10 micrograms/min), respectively. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Maximal vasodilative potential, determined during reactive hyperemia, was reduced in the patients with congestive heart failure. The maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol was comparable in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects (8.0 +/- 1.1 versus 9.2 +/- 1.2 ml/100 ml of tissue/min, respectively, p = NS). Furthermore, the dose-response relation to isoproterenol was similar in both groups. Likewise, the forearm vasodilative response to sodium nitroprusside was preserved in the heart failure group. Plasma concentration of norepinephrine was higher in the patients with heart failure (436 +/- 34 versus 201 +/- 74 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). When both groups were considered, there was no correlation between norepinephrine levels and the maximal forearm blood flow response to isoproterenol (r = 0.10, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor desensitization does not occur in the limb vessels of patients with congestive heart failure. 
Induction of transformational changes in normal endothelial cells by cultured human astrocytoma cells. Endothelial cell proliferation is a significant biological feature of malignant astrocytomas. The ability of the cells of these tumors to elaborate mitogenic angiogenesis factors has been well documented. However, less is known about the transformational effects that neoplastic astrocytes may have on the endothelial cells within malignant astrocytomas. In this study, the hypothesis that humoral factors elaborated by cells derived from malignant astrocytomas induce transformational changes in normal endothelial cells in vitro is investigated. Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from exponentially growing cultures of a human glioblastoma cell line (UW18) and from two rat brain-tumor cell lines: an anaplastic astrocytoma (R175A) and a glioblastoma with sarcomatous elements (9L). Subconfluent target bovine aortic arch endothelial cells (BAEC's) were exposed for 48 hours to varying concentrations of CM prepared from each of these tumors, and then evaluated for transformational changes. Different molecular weight (MW) fractions of UW18 CM were prepared by molecular ultrafiltration, and each fraction was tested for transforming activity. Transformation endpoints included changes in cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and distribution (measured by differential flow cytometry) and changes in de novo DNA synthesis determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Significant changes in the amount and distribution of DNA and RNA were observed in the BAEC's treated with UW18 CM compared to untreated BAEC's. At 10% concentrations of UW18 CM, changes in the RNA profile of target BAEC's were evident, and at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM, an irregular bimodal distribution was well established. Patterns of DNA were also altered in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant aneuploidy developing at UW18 CM concentrations of 20%. The DNA synthesis in BAEC's increased with increasing CM concentrations, up to a maximum of about 250% of control values at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM. The transformational changes induced after exposure of BAEC's to CM prepared from R175A and 9L were significantly less than those observed with UW18 CM. Molecular ultrafiltration was used to prepare UW18 CM fractions with MW cutoffs of less than 10 kD, 10 to 30 kD, and greater than 30 kD. Transformational activity was significant only in CM's with an MW of 10 to 30 kD. It is concluded that the UW18 human glioblastoma cell line elaborates a soluble factor, or group of factors, with an MW in the 10- to 30-kD range, capable of inducing transformational alterations in target normal endothelial cells, and that such transformation may account for some of the abnormal endothelial cell changes associated with malignant astrocytomas. 
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in childhood with long-term survival. A diffuse, well-differentiated, malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) developed in a nine-year-old girl. She received limited chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is alive and well without clinical evidence of disease 109 months after diagnosis. The neoplastic cells stained immunohistochemically for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen but were unreactive with B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen, and anti-Leu-M1. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had abundant desmosomes, numerous tonofilament bundles, and variable-length microvilli. These findings confirm the mesothelial nature of the cells. Features consistent with malignancy included DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometric analysis and diffuse peritoneal involvement. The three previously described survivors with MPM were also premenarchal girls. Some MPMs in premenarchal girls have an indolent biologic behavior similar to that of low-grade peritoneal serous neoplasia or well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in adult women. 
t-PA, PAI, and protein C before and after vascular occlusion of the upper limb in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI) were assessed in venous blood drawn before and after venous occlusion (bvo, avo) for 33 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), 14 with primary RP (PRP), 9 with suspected secondary RP (SSRP), and 10 with definite collagen disease and secondary RP (SRP). There were significant differences in PAI values avo between PRP (and controls), SSRP, and SRP. PAI activity decreased significantly avo only in controls and in PRP, and there was significant t-PA antigen elevation avo in the same groups. In addition, since PAI is neutralized by activated protein C (PC), both PC antigen and PC activity were assessed avo and bvo. PC Ag remained unchanged in all groups, with PC activity significantly lower than controls in SRP and SSRP. Finally the authors looked for interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus-like anticoagulant (LAC) with the PC system in collagen disease-associated RP. Specific IgG ACA were found in only 1 patient with SRP. In conclusion, there is an endothelial derangement, involving t-PA release and PAI, in SSRP and SRP patients. The reduced PC activity in these latter groups appears to be due to increased PAI influence rather than to ACA/LAC. 
Blood and bone marrow eosinophilia in malignant tumors. Role and nature of blood and tissue eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in two patients. Eosinophilia of the blood and bone marrow may be encountered in patients with disseminated malignancies. It is unrelated to the histologic type of the tumor but usually reflects its aggressiveness and prognostic outlook. Its pathogenesis is controversial. The presence of eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in serum and malignant tissue extracts was evaluated in two cases of malignancies accompanied by marked blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. When compared with controls, serum and tumor tissue extracts stimulated the growth of G, M, and Eo colonies in semisolid cultures of human bone marrow. Such stimulating effect was inhibited by the addition of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3. Thus, the colony-stimulating factor(s) play a role in the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia associated with some malignant tumors, and these factors appear to include GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and probably others. 
Determination of postmortem interval by arthropod succession: a case study from the Hawaiian Islands. A postmortem interval of 34 to 36 days was established for remains recovered on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, based on interpretations of patterns of arthropod succession on the remains. This interval was primarily based on the presence of adult specimens of Philonthus longicornis (family Staphylinidae), mature larvae of Piophila casei (family Piophilidae), and empty puparial cases of Chrysomya rufifacies (family Calliphoridae). Species and developmental stages of two additional Coleoptera species and three additional Diptera species were also present, which was consistent with the estimated interval, although not definitive. 
Patients admitted to the emergency room with symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. All 7157 patients (55% men) admitted to the emergency room with chest pain or other symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction during a period of 21 months were registered consecutively. Chest pain was reported by 93% of the patients. On the basis of history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram in the emergency room, all patients were prospectively classified in one of four categories: (i) obvious infarction (4% of all patients); (ii) strongly suspected infarction (20%); (iii) vague suspicion of infarction (35%); and (iv) no suspected infarction (41%). In patients with no suspected infarction (n = 2910), musculoskeletal (26%), obscure (21%) and psychogenic origins (16%) of the symptoms occurred most frequently. We conclude that few of the patients had an obvious infarction on admission, and that a musculoskeletal origin of the symptoms occurred most frequently in patients with no suspected infarction. 
Enteroscopic diagnosis of small bowel ulceration in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who had chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent extended small bowel examination with a Sonde enteroscope. 7 patients (47%) were found to have jejunal or ileal ulceration. Small bowel enteroscopy may be a valuable technique for the investigation of undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Chromosomal origin of small ring marker chromosomes in man: characterization by molecular genetics [published erratum appears in Am J Hum Genet 1991 Aug;49(2):503] Ten cases of small ring chromosomes which did not stain with distamycinA/DAPI and did not possess satellite regions associated with nucleolus-organizing regions are described. In situ hybridization with a battery of biotinylated pericentric repeat probes specific either for individual chromosomes or for groups of chromosomes allowed the identification of the chromosomal origin of these marker chromosomes. There was one example of a marker derived from each of chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 14, 16, 18, 20, 13 or 21, and the X, and there were two examples of markers derived from chromosome 12. One case possessed two markers, one derived from chromosome 6, and one derived from the X. The mechanism of generation of ring marker chromosomes is discussed. Five of seven cases who could be phenotypically assessed were abnormal. Three of these--the first with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 1; the second with two markers, one derived from chromosome 6 and the other from the X chromosome; and the third with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 20--each possessed distinctive facies. Additional cases with identified rings may allow the delineation of new chromosomal syndromes. 
Ependymoma: internal correlations among pathological signs: the anaplastic variant. In a series of 298 cases of ependymoma, survival analysis identified some prognostic histological factors but failed to demonstrate a worse survival for the anaplastic variant diagnosed with the common criteria used for assessing anaplasia in primitive brain tumors. This finding suggests that either anaplastic ependymoma does not exist, or that the established criteria are not useful in its identification. To solve these problems, the association of histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural signs in 173 intracranial cases was investigated and analyzed by means of contingency tables. Many signs had only focal distribution. Some signs, meaningful for anaplasia, such as very high cell density and number of mitoses, were found to be associated, whereas other signs usually considered indicative of anaplasia, such as endothelial hyperplasia, glomeruli, and necrosers, were not. In addition, pseudorosettes, mesodermic areas, and incomplete formation of perivascular pseudorosettes were signs associated with very high cell density and number of mitoses. Distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, as well as other immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features, were not helpful, with the exception of microsettes found by electron microscopy. Our conclusion is that the anaplastic variant of ependymoma is recognizable only when some histological prognostic factors, such as cell density and number of mitoses, are maximally expressed. 
Longitudinal study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertensive pregnant women: deviations related to the development of superimposed preeclampsia. A prospective longitudinal study of 25 pregnant women (30 pregnancies) with chronic hypertension, a group prone to development of preeclampsia, was conducted to explore the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the development of superimposed preeclampsia. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58). Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups. However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed. Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester. Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased. These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis. 
Hypalgesic efficacy of acupuncture on experimental pain in man. Comparison of laser acupuncture and needle acupuncture. The analgesic effect of acupuncture on cutaneous heat stimuli of 43 degrees C has been evaluated in a controlled experimental study with healthy, informed volunteers. Laser acupuncture was administered to 39 probationers using a helium-neon laser under double-blind conditions. The point Hegu (L.I.4) and Jianqian (Extra.) on both sides were each irradiated for 1 min. Forty probationers were needled with stainless steel needles in the point Hegu (L.I.4) on both sides under single-blind conditions. Pain threshold was measured in terms of the time (in msec) that the probationers needed to perceive the cutaneous heat stimulus of 43 degrees C. The painful stimulus was generated by a computer-controlled standardized procedure. The Wilcoxon test was used for the statistical evaluation. Laser acupuncture did not change the pain threshold. Needle acupuncture did, however, increase the pain threshold compared with the initial value (alpha = 0.1%). The difference compared with the control group, where a placebo point was needled, was also significant (alpha = 5%). This controlled experimental study proves the analgesic effect of needle acupuncture on painful heat stimuli. Laser acupuncture had no effect on pain threshold in this study. 
Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. 
Comparison of efficacy of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients older and younger than 65 years of age. PURPOSE: The efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was compared in elderly patients and younger patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Clinical characteristics, surgical complications, and long-term survival rates were compared between the two age groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 54 elderly patients (greater than 65 years) and 79 younger patients (less than 65 years) who had had AICDs implanted for recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: In 85% of elderly patients and 78% of younger patients, coronary artery disease was the underlying disease (NS). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.4 +/- 14.3% in the elderly patients and 35.7 +/- 17.6% in the younger patients (NS). Concomitant myocardial revascularization was performed in 37% of elderly patients and 29% of younger patients (NS); however, only 4% of elderly patients had concomitant left ventricular resection or cryoablation, compared with 15% of younger patients (p less than 0.001). Two patients in each age group died perioperatively (4% versus 3%, NS), and no significant difference in surgical morbidity or length of hospital stay following AICD implantation was noted between the age groups. In conjunction with AICD, elderly patients more commonly received antiarrhythmic drugs, with 54% of elderly patients taking amiodarone at the time of hospital discharge compared with 29% of the younger patients (p less than 0.008). In contrast, beta-blockers were more commonly used in younger patients (16% versus 2%, p less than 0.03). At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 11 (20%) elderly patients and 16 (20%) younger patients had died. Six deaths in elderly patients and five deaths in younger patients were classified as arrhythmic deaths (NS); however, only one younger patient and three elderly patients died suddenly (NS). Calculated survival curves demonstrated similar survival rates in the two age groups with approximately 90%, 87%, and 80% of the patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Theoretic survival curves calculated from appropriate AICD shocks demonstrated significantly lower survival compared with actual survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AICD is a very effective treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and this benefit applies to elderly patients as well as younger patients. 
Helicobacter pylori: aggressor or innocent bystander? Helicobacter pylori seeks gastric mucosa, whether found in the stomach, duodenum, or Barrett's esophagus. Definitive diagnosis can be secured by appropriate stains of mucosal biopsies and culture, but the rapid urease test, breath isotope studies, and serologic testing are also useful. The frequency of colonization increases with advancing age, but infection occurs earlier in underdeveloped countries. Although the reservoir is uncertain, water or food transmission seems likely. There is sufficient evidence to assign an etiologic role to the bacteria in the causation of type B antral gastritis. H. pylori is found in areas of gastric metaplasia within the duodenum and is associated with duodenitis. Although acute infection leads to hypochlorhydria, chronic colonization has little effect on acid secretion. Studies have thus far failed to establish a convincing relationship between H. pylori and nonulcer dyspepsia, although the bacteria may play a role in selected patients. H. pylori is found in association with most idiopathic gastric and duodenal ulcers, but it is unclear as to whether the bacteria plays a causative or permissive role. The organism has a predilection for intercellular spaces and the mucous layer, thus affording relative isolation from luminally active antibiotics. Monotherapy with bismuth preparations transiently eliminates the bacteria, but recolonization is rapid, probably due to regrowth of sequestered organisms. A combination of metronidazole, bismuth, and tetracycline (or amoxicillin) affords the best eradication rate, but the potential side effects of this program should be considered. The present therapy of duodenal ulcer disease is effective and without significant risk. Treatment of H. pylori should be reserved for those patients who relapse on adequate maintenance therapy. If a safe and effective antibiotic becomes available, more frequent testing and earlier treatment intervention may become more attractive. H. pylori is probably an "innocent bystander" for most patients, but the bacteria may sufficiently impair the defenses of the antral and duodenal mucosa to facilitate the development and relapse of ulcer disease in subsets of patients. 
Wound infiltration of local anaesthetic after lower segment caesarean section. The analgesic efficacy of subcutaneous wound infiltration with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine after elective lower segment section Caesarean section was studied in 28 patients in a double-blind randomised controlled manner using a patient-controlled analgesia system. The mean 24-hour morphine consumption of the placebo group and the bupivacaine group was similar (76 mg and 68 mg respectively). Analysis of the cumulative hourly morphine consumption failed to show any statistically significant differences between the groups. However, on a weight-adjusted basis statistically significant differences in morphine consumption were demonstrated, although these may not be clinically important. Subjective experiences of pain, nausea and drowsiness assessed by linear analogue scoring were similar in both groups. 
Temporal bone findings in a family with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR). A family group with confirmed branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was investigated in this study. Computerized tomography of the temporal bones has demonstrated that the malformations of the inner ear consist of hypoplastic structural changes within the cochlea with reduced vertical diameters, and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals and normal endolymphatic ducts. It is concluded that in the present cases, the Mondini malformation of the cochlea is not associated with the BOR syndrome. 
Mycosis fungoides and the Sezary syndrome: a review of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and the Sezary syndrome (SS) are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with a T-cell phenotype, which have cutaneous involvement as their predominant feature. These disorders are becoming more common, and the patients are frequently being referred to medical oncologists for assistance in management. The development of advanced laboratory techniques, such as molecular genetics and cell-surface phenotyping, has greatly enhanced our understanding of their pathogenesis and may lead to identification of responsible etiologic factors. A myriad of treatment options have been investigated including topical approaches, systemic chemotherapy, and external radiation. Currently, extensive trials are underway examining the potential benefits of agents such as the interferons, interleukin-2, monoclonal antibodies, the retinoids, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and other novel biologic response modifiers or chemotherapeutics. Although all these therapies have benefit in phase II trials, few randomized comparative trials have been performed to identify optimal therapies. Performance of such trials should now become a priority. 
Impact of impinging wall jet on color Doppler quantification of mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. In clinical color Doppler examinations, mitral regurgitant jets are often observed to impinge on the left atrial wall immediately beyond the mitral valve. In accordance with fluid dynamics theory, we hypothesized that a jet impinging on a wall would lose momentum more rapidly, undergo spatial distortion, and thus have a different observed jet area from that of a free jet with an identical flow rate. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied 44 patients with mitral regurgitation--30 with centrally directed free jets and 14 with eccentrically directed impinging wall jets. Maximal color jet areas (cm2) (with and without correction for left atrial size) were correlated with mitral regurgitant volumes, flow rates, and fractions derived from pulsed Doppler mitral and aortic forward flows. The groups were compared by analysis of covariance. Mean +/- SD mitral regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, and mean flow rate averaged 37 +/- 17%, 3.06 +/- 2.65 l/min, and 147 +/- 118 ml/sec, respectively. The maximal jet area from color Doppler imaging correlated relatively well with the mitral regurgitant fraction in the patients with free mitral regurgitant jets (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) but poorly in the patients with impinging wall jets (r = 0.42, p = NS). Although the mitral regurgitant fraction was larger (p less than 0.05) in patients with wall jets (44 +/- 20%) than in those with free jets (33 +/- 15%), the maximal jet area was significantly smaller (4.78 +/- 2.87 cm2 for wall jets versus 9.17 +/- 6.45 cm2 for free jets, p less than 0.01). For the same regurgitant fraction, wall jets were only approximately 40% of the size of a corresponding free jet, a difference confirmed by analysis of covariance (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Patients with mitral regurgitation frequently have jets that impinge on the left atrial wall close to the mitral valve. Such impinging wall jets are less predictable and usually have much smaller color Doppler areas in conventional echocardiographic views than do free jets of similar regurgitant severity. Jet morphology should be considered in the semiquantitative interpretation of mitral regurgitation by Doppler color flow mapping. Future studies of the three-dimensional morphology of wall jets may aid in their assessment. 
Malignant biliary obstruction: percutaneous use of self-expandable stents A total of 83 self-expandable metallic stents were placed percutaneously in 69 patients for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. Stent diameter was 1 cm; length, 3.5-10.5 cm. Of the 41 patients with common bile duct obstruction, 27 died 0.2-12 months (median, 3.2 months) after stent insertion. Two patients developed recurrent jaundice and cholangitis after 6 and 12 months, respectively. One patient underwent reintervention. Fourteen patients were alive without jaundice 1-8 months (median, 6.3 months) after stent placement. Of the 28 patients with hilar lesions, 13 died 0.7-7.6 months (median, 4.3 months) after stent placement. Fifteen were alive 1-15.5 months (median, 8.1 months) afterward. Recurrent jaundice and cholangitis were seen in eight of the 28 patients (28%) after 1-6 months (median, 3.6 months). The cause of malfunction of the stent(s) was tumor ingrowth in one patient, tumor overgrowth at the proximal end in five patients, and overgrowth at the distal end in two patients. Reintervention was performed in five patients (18%). Stent-related complications were seen in four patients. 
Aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery: a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Of 43 cavernous sinus aneurysms diagnosed over 6 1/2 years, 23 fulfilled indications for treatment; of these 19 were treated, eight surgically and 11 with interventional radiological techniques. Six small and two giant aneurysms were treated surgically: four were clipped, two were repaired primarily, and two were trapped with placement of a saphenous-vein bypass graft. Seven large and four giant aneurysms were treated with interventional radiological techniques: in five cases the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) was sacrificed; one aneurysm was trapped with detachable balloons; and five were embolized with preservation of the ICA lumen. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. At follow-up examination, three patients in the surgical group were asymptomatic, two had improved, and three had worsened. Three of these patients had asymptomatic infarctions apparent on computerized tomography (CT) scans. At follow-up examination, four radiologically treated patients were asymptomatic, five had improved, two were unchanged, and none had worsened. One patient had asymptomatic and one minimally symptomatic infarction apparent on CT scans; both lesions were embolic foci after aneurysm embolization with preservation of the ICA. It is concluded that treatment risk depends more on the adequacy of collateral circulation than on the size of the aneurysm. A multidisciplinary treatment protocol for these aneurysms is described, dividing patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups based on pretreatment evaluation of the risk of temporary or permanent ICA occlusion using a clinical balloon test occlusion coupled with an ICA-occluded stable xenon/CT cerebral blood flow study. Radiological techniques are suggested for most low-risk patients, while direct surgical techniques are proposed for most moderate- and high-risk patients. 
Lumbar disc surgery: results of the Prospective Lumbar Discectomy Study of the Joint Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The Prospective Lumbar Discectomy Study enrolled 740 patients in a multiphysician, multicenter, consecutive patient protocol to evaluate the indications and efficacy of lumbar discectomy. Five hundred and thirteen patients could be evaluated at 3 months after surgery. Stepwise logistic regression showed that the factors of fraction of pain referred to the back, work-related injury, absence of back pain on straight leg-raise examination, correspondence of leg pain to typical radicular patterns, leg pain on straight leg-raise examination, and reflex asymmetry were independently predictive of good outcome from surgery. Univariate analysis of the case with different numbers of predictive factors present showed that use of the operating microscope, sensory deficit, central disc bulge, and free disc fragment were correlated with outcome only in subgroups. An analysis of unsatisfactory outcomes showed two patterns: one of failure as a result of mechanical back pain and one of failure as a result of radiculopathy. Factors predictive of outcome did not influence the type of failure. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis, facetectomy and preoperative sensory deficit were associated with increased likelihood of mechanical back pain failure, while preoperative motor deficit was associated with an increased likelihood of radicular failure. The results support several intuitively derived and commonly believed principles of lumbar disc surgery. 
Umbilical cord occlusion stimulates breathing independent of blood gases and pH. The role of umbilical cord occlusion in the initiation of breathing at birth was investigated by use of 16 unanesthetized fetal sheep near full term. Artificial ventilation with high-frequency oscillation was used to control fetal arterial blood gas tensions. At baseline, PCO2 was maintained at control fetal values and PO2 was elevated to between 25 and 50 Torr. In the first study on six intact and four vagotomized fetuses, arterial PCO2 and PO2 were maintained constant during two 30-min periods of umbilical cord occlusion. Nevertheless, the mean fetal breathing rate increased significantly when the umbilical cord was occluded. In the second study on six intact fetuses, hypercapnia (68 Torr) was imposed by adding CO2 to the ventilation gas. When the umbilical cord was occluded, there was a significantly greater stimulation of breathing (rate, incidence, and amplitude) in response to hypercapnia than in response to hypercapnia alone. During cord occlusion, plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration decreased significantly. Results indicate that cord occlusion stimulates breathing possibly by causing the removal of a placentally produced respiratory inhibitor such as prostaglandin E2 from the circulation. 
v-abl causes hematopoietic disease distinct from that caused by bcr-abl. v-abl, the oncogene transduced by Abelson murine leukemia virus, was first characterized by its ability to transform lymphoid cells. bcr-abl, the oncogene formed by a t(9;22) translocation thought to occur in human hematopoietic stem cells, is detectable in almost all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a malignancy of granulocytic cells. bcr-abl also causes a CML-like syndrome in mice whose bone-marrow cells are infected with a retrovirus transducing the gene. More recent reports have suggested that v-abl can, however, cause a disease similar to CML. We demonstrate here that v-abl, when transduced in a helper virus-containing system, causes disease similar to, but distinct from, the CML-like syndrome induced by bcr-abl. Animals whose bone marrow has been infected by v-abl virus develop modest splenomegaly, marked granulocytosis, and malignant disease of several hematopoietic cell types. Unlike animals with CML-like disease resulting from bcr-abl, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes from animals infected with a v-abl construct do not contain the v-abl provirus at a significant frequency. Histopathologic analysis also shows significant differences between the diseases caused by v-abl and bcr-abl. 
Loss of transforming growth factor beta 1 receptors and its effects on the growth of EBV-transformed human B cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent negative regulator of normal human B cell growth mediated by exogenous signals, including IL-2 and low m.w. B cell growth factor 12 kDa (BCGF-12 kDa). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory linkage between viral or nonviral transformation of human B cells and the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. A panel of EBV+ and EBV- B cell lines, derived either by in vitro EBV B cell transformation, or from cases of lymphoma was used to quantitate the negative growth effects of TGF-beta 1. The proliferative response of three EBV- B cell lines to rBCGF-12 kDa or serum was inhibited by low concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.2-0.5 ng/ml for 50% maximal effect), as measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and viable cellular recovery. In contrast, rBCGF-12 kDa or serum mediated proliferation of three EBV+ B cell lines was refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) for this differential growth control in EBV+ and EBV- B cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta 1, c-myc, and TGF-beta 1 receptors. No correlation was observed between the expression of TGF-beta 1 or c-myc gene and growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 in the cell lines studied. Our results indicate that sensitivity or resistance to TGF-beta 1 correlated with the presence or absence (loss) of high affinity receptors for TGF-beta 1. EBV- B cell lines expressed levels of high affinity receptors similar to those found on activated normal B or T cells. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines showed no detectable high affinity receptors. Chemical cross-linking studies with a bifunctional reagent, dissuccinimidyl suberate revealed a normal expression of type I (65-70 kDa), type II (85-90 kDa), and type III (280-300 kDa) TGF-beta 1 high affinity receptors on EBV- B cell lines. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines did not express type I and type II receptors, whereas type III receptors were expressed but could not be inhibited by unlabeled TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha after bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are often followed by the development of fever and other influenza-like symptoms. We report the onset of these symptoms in a healthy volunteer following bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage; the symptoms were temporally associated with the dramatic elevation of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor. Our observations suggest that tumor necrosis factor may be involved in mediating fever and other influenza-like symptoms occurring after bronchoscopy. 
Purpura fulminans and adrenal hemorrhage due to group Y meningococcemia in an elderly woman. A 70-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with a 1-day history of malaise, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, rigors, and confusion. She was found to be in septic shock with purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She died within 36 hours of admission. Blood cultures grew Neisseria meningitidis group Y. Necropsy revealed evidence of shock and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. 
Effect of a bulk-forming cathartic on diarrhea in tube-fed patients. Diarrhea is a significant complication for the patient being tube-fed. The purpose of this study was to observe whether giving a bulk-forming cathartic to patients receiving enteral nutrition via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube would result in firmer stools for these patients. Forty-nine patients in a large medical center were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group. During the 6-day study period 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of psyllium preparation was administered through the feeding tube three times a day. Data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. The hypothesis that giving a bulk-forming cathartic would lead to firmer stools was supported at an alpha level of less than 0.01. The results of this study suggest that use of a bulk-forming cathartic in tube-fed patients will significantly reduce the diarrhea associated with this type of feeding. 
Radical hysterectomy versus radiation therapy for stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix. Three hundred forty-five patients with Stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 to 1985. The overall cumulative 5-year survival rate was 89% and the mean age was 44.6 years. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 92%; 14 patients were explored for radical hysterectomy that was not performed due to high risk features and their survival rate was 50%. Ninety-seven patients underwent radiation therapy as initial treatment and had a 5-year survival rate of 86%. There was no significant difference when radiation therapy was compared with radical hysterectomy (P = 0.098). The survival rates for lesions 3 cm or smaller were 94% for radical hysterectomy and 88% for radiation therapy. When the lesion was larger than 3 cm, the survival rates were 82% with radical surgery and 73% with radiation therapy. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was present in 26 of the 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy. When 1 to 3 nodes were involved 16 of 19 patients survived and when 4 to 10 nodes were involved 3 of 7 patients survived. The addition of radiation therapy did not influence survival. Complications were similar in both treatment groups. Fistulas occurred in 4 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 1 of 111 undergoing radiation. Second surgery for a complication was required in 6 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 7 of 111 undergoing radiation. Survival and complication rates in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are equal with either radical surgery or radiation therapy. 
Chemotherapy update. The administration of chemotherapy is one of the major forms of cancer treatment. Recent progress in the use of chemotherapeutic agents has evolved from an understanding of the basic mechanisms of tumor cell kinetics and the molecular and biochemical basis for individual and multidrug resistance patterns. These advances have led to the development of novel approaches to the administration of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Nurses must remain knowledgeable about these concepts to understand the mechanisms underlying the administration of various combinations of cancer chemotherapy. 
Application of estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay to aspirates from mammographically guided fine needle biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions. The importance of hormone receptors in the management and prognosis of breast cancer is well established, but difficult to apply to the growing numbers of very small breast cancers being detected. To assess the feasibility of applying estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay (ER-ICA) to cytologic specimens, we prospectively studied 100 patients who had fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of mammographically detected nonpalpable breast lesions. All 100 patients also had surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions immediately after cytologic aspiration. Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology; 17 of them had been cytologically diagnosed. Using specific monoclonal antibody for estrogen receptor, we applied ER-ICA to cytologic preparation of 15 malignant neoplasms with sufficient cellular material available for the assay. Positive immunostaining was demonstrated in nine cases. No ER expression was seen in six cases. Immunocytochemical assay was also done on frozen tissue of the corresponding surgically removed tumors, with 86.6% concordance between the two results. This study is the first to demonstrate that ER-ICA can be effective in assessing hormone receptor content of mammographically directed cytologic aspirates. 
Clinical implications of pathophysiologic changes in the midlife hypertensive patient. Both aging and hypertension decrease cardiac output through a lower stroke volume and a diminished beta-adrenergic responsiveness. In parallel, the vascular resistance increases because of vascular hypertrophy. In addition, in hypertension the alpha-adrenergic responsiveness is enhanced. Aging and hypertension are also associated with an increase in plasma cholesterol and insulin values. These alterations in cholesterol and insulin levels become particularly pronounced in middle-aged patients with hypertension. alpha-Adrenergic-blocking agents have a positive effect on lipids and insulin resistance. The shift toward enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsiveness, and the fact that vasodilators do not diminish exercise performance favor the use of alpha-blockers as a first drug in middle-aged patients with hypertension. Blood pressure lowering still remains the paramount goal, and these compounds should be used only if proved to be efficacious in a given individual patient. 
An approach to the evaluation and treatment of microscopic hematuria. Persistent microscopic hematuria in children is most often benign or untreatable. The evaluation of microscopic hematuria in an otherwise healthy child need not require invasive and costly laboratory studies. The initial evaluation must look for signs of life-threatening causes of hematuria, i.e., hypertension, edema, oliguria, or significant proteinuria. If these are absent, a stepwise evaluation is suggested, which includes microscopic examination of the urine for red blood cell casts, a test for proteinuria, serum creatinine, and serial follow-up. Renal biopsy may establish a diagnosis but rarely changes the treatment in a child with asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria. 
Infantile meningitis in England and Wales: a two year study. A two year prospective study identified 1922 cases of meningitis in children under 1 year of age. A further 201 cases were identified from other sources. The annual incidence of meningitis during the first year of life was 1.6/1000; during the first 28 days of life it was 0.32/1000, and among postneonatal infants it was 1.22/1000. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The overall case fatality rate was 19.8% for neonates and 5.4% for postneonatal infants. Two thirds of deaths identified in the study, 50% of all deaths, were not attributed to meningitis by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Group B beta haemolytic streptococci (28%), Escherichia coli (18%), and Listeria monocytogenes (5%) were most frequently isolated from neonates and Neisseria meningitidis (31%), Haemophilus influenzae (30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) from postneonatal infants. At 2-6 months of age N meningitidis meningitis was most common, and at 7-12 months H influenzae predominated. Meningitis caused by group B beta haemolytic streptococci occurred up to 6 months of age and had a consistent mortality of 25%. Neonatal meningitis due to Gram negative enteric rods had a mortality of 32%. Low birth weight was a significant predisposing factor for both neonates and postneonatal infants. In both groups mortality was significantly higher among children admitted in coma. There was no seasonal variation in incidence in either group. Neonates were treated with either group. Neonates were treated with either chloramphenicol (50%) or gentamicin (48%) usually in combination with a penicillin; 40% received a third generation cephalosporin. Of the 1472 postneonatal infants treated 84% received chloramphenicol with a penicillin and 10% received a third generation cephalosporin. 
Interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in 15 children with advanced metastatic neuroblastoma. A phase II trial using interleukin-2 (IL2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells was carried out in an attempt to treat children with end-stage neuroblastoma. Fifteen patients (median age, 7 years) were enrolled in the study. Twelve were in relapse after massive chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and three had a primary refractory disease after conventional chemotherapy. IL2 was administered as an 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d continuous infusion. One course consisted of a double 5-day treatment period separated by a 6-day break. Cytapheresis to harvest LAK progenitor cells was performed during the rest period. After a 4-day in vitro culture, LAK cells were reinjected during the second cycle of therapy. A phenotypic and functional analysis of immunologic parameters was conducted along with the therapeutic protocol. Toxicity was significant with two toxic deaths (cardiotoxicity and respiratory distress). The reinfusion of large amounts of LAK cells was clearly involved in one case, but this particularly severe toxicity has to be related to the patient's status (ie, heavy pretreatment). No significant clinical response was seen. The immunologic monitoring showed phenotypic and functional modifications in these patients before initiation of treatment and an unexpected absence of evolution of these parameters during IL2 therapy. Although the origin of these immune dysfunctions is not clear, they could be involved in the failure of IL2 therapy. Future studies of IL2 therapy in neuroblastoma should be undertaken earlier in the course of the disease. 
Unexplained weight loss in the ambulatory elderly. Significant unexplained and unintentional weight loss was found in 45 elderly patients who were identified by computer search of the diagnostic files of seven family practice centers. We performed a case series chart review study which revealed that 24% of the 45 cases had no definitive etiology for the weight loss after two years of extensive clinical investigation. Depression was found to be the most common diagnosis made (18%) followed by cancer (16%). Only four patients died during the study period and all had cancer. The most prevalent diagnosis in this group of ambulatory elderly patients did not prove to be cancer, as often though, but rather "unexplained weight loss." CT scans were not found to be helpful as screening tests in the evaluation of weight loss. Using the data from this study, the diagnostic evaluations of elderly patients with unexplained weight loss may be more efficiently directed. 
Irrationality in the management of breast cancer. I. The staging system. The historic development of breast cancer staging began early in the 20th century with the simple concept of early localized disease, spread to regional nodes, and the presence of distant metastases. This last group often was divided into patients with advanced but perhaps still curable locoregional disease and incurable patients with distant metastases. As increasing numbers of prognostic factors were recognized, efforts were made to incorporate them into the staging systems to combine patients with similar prognosis into the same stages. These attempts resulted in the development of four classifications, namely, the Columbia, Manchester, International, and American tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems. Although many benefits of staging were reported, the most important was that of permitting valid comparisons between different treatments and different institutions. Many success-limiting factors were noticed during the developmental years, and even though the TNM system has been accepted, numerous speakers and authors present their staged data in a confusing and ambiguous manner. Recommendations are made that would permit clarification of presentations to general medical audiences along with recognizable statistical validity. 
Biliary bile acid profiles in familial adenomatous polyposis. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have an excess risk for adenomas and cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. In the upper intestine these lesions occur mainly around the ampulla of Vater and they parallel mucosal exposure to bile. In view of this finding and of evidence that bile acids play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, biliary bile acid profiles were determined in 29 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (12 before colectomy, 17 after colectomy) and in 28 patients without familial adenomatous polyposis (all with colons in situ). Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis had a higher total biliary bile acid concentration than the others. The bile of patients with polyposis had a greater proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid and a lower proportion of deoxycholic acid than did the bile of patients without polyposis. The ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid and its metabolite lithocholic acid to cholic acid and its metabolite deoxycholic acid, which is related to subsequent bile acid profiles in the colon, was higher in patients with polyposis. Because bile acids influence cellular proliferation, these findings may be of importance with respect to intestinal adenoma and cancer growth. 
Quantitative analysis of inflammatory cell influx, procollagen type I synthesis, and collagen cross-linking in incisional wounds: influence of PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 therapy. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB homodimer) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are potent wound-healing hormones that accelerate incisional repair. To identify more precisely and quantitatively the stage(s) of wound healing influenced by growth-factor therapy, we investigated the three sequential tissue repair processes--inflammatory cell influx, intracellular procollagen type I (PC-I) synthesis, and collagen cross-linking--in recombinant growth factor--treated wounds. Using newly developed automated, quantitative image-analysis techniques, we observed that PDGF-BB markedly augmented the directed migration of macrophages into wounds during the first week after wounding and triggered and earlier and more sustained influx of PC-I--containing fibroblasts into the wound when compared with results in TGF-beta 1-treated or control wounds (p = 0.015 at day 2; p = 0.007 at day 21). In contrast, automated image analysis revealed TGF-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts had a nearly twofold increase in intracellular levels of PC-I protein when compared with PDGF-BB-treated or control wound fibroblasts (p = 0.004 at day 4). However, the influence of TGF-beta 1 was transient, and the longer duration of PDGF-BB activity suggested a later influence, perhaps on the collagen remodeling phase, which is ultimately required for increased wound strength. To address this possibility, collagen cross-linking in growth factor-treated wounds was inhibited by beta-aminoproprionitrile (BAPN) treatment, and wound breaking strength was analyzed. Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 continued to enhance repair in BAPN-treated rats, indicating that they do not function primarily at the level of collagen cross-linking. Thus, PDGF-BB appears to enhance the inflammatory phase of wound healing to indirectly trigger PC-I synthesis, whereas TGF-beta 1 quantitatively enhances PC-I synthesis directly, accounting for their differing duration of activities within healing wounds. 
Dideoxyinosine in children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. BACKGROUND. 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddl) is a dideoxynucleoside with potent activity in vitro against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In initial clinical trials in adults, ddl showed evidence of antiretroviral activity with little hematologic toxicity. METHODS. We conducted a phase I-II study in 43 children with symptomatic (CDC class P-2) HIV infection. Of these children, 16 (median age, 10 years) had previously received zidovudine, and 27 (median age, 2.6 years) had not. ddl was administered orally in three divided doses totalling 60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 24 weeks. Eight of the 43 patients did not complete 24 weeks of ddl: 6 died, 1 was withdrawn because of progressive disease, and the other because of toxicity. RESULTS. After oral administration, ddl was rapidly absorbed, although its bioavailability varied greatly among patients. Pancreatitis developed in two children, one receiving ddl at each of the two highest doses. The median CD4 cell count in 38 patients with paired counts increased from 0.218 x 10(9) per liter (218 per cubic millimeter) at base line to 0.327 x 10(9) per liter (327 per cubic millimeter) after 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.001). Those with CD4 cell counts above 0.1 x 10(9) per liter (100 per cubic millimeter) at base line were significantly more likely to improve in this respect. The median levels of p24 antigen (in 27 patients with detectable levels at entry) declined from 272 pg per milliliter at base line to 77 pg per milliliter at 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.005). The plasma concentration of ddl correlated significantly with both the degree of decline in the p24 antigen and the degree of improvement in IQ score. Improvement in clinical and immunologic measures occurred in both the previously untreated patients and in those who had been treated with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS. Dideoxyinosine was well tolerated and showed promising antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected children. The correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of ddl indicates that bioavailability is an important consideration in the use of ddl to treat HIV infection and that individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment may be important for optimal activity. 
Use of graded exercise to evaluate physiological hyperreactivity to mental stress. Physiological hyperreactivity (i.e., response in excess of metabolic requirements) to mental stress has been implicated in the etiology of coronary heart disease. This study evaluated potential hyperreactivity of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and biochemical variables to mental stress. Thirty healthy males, 19-36 yr, performed a mental arithmetic task and cycle ergometry at three powerloads. Linear regressions were calculated for each of 17 dependent variables during exercise, with oxygen uptake (VO2) serving as the independent variable. Ten variables were significantly correlated (P less than 0.003) with VO2 during exercise and, therefore, were predicted at the VO2 observed during the arithmetic task. The actual level of each variable observed during the arithmetic task was compared with the level predicted from the exercise by paired t-tests. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, and respiratory exchange ratio were significantly greater (7-32%, P less than 0.005) during the arithmetic task than predicted from the exercise at an equivalent VO2. Plasma cortisol and serum lipid variables were not useful for evaluating hyperreactivity. Results demonstrated that graded aerobic exercise can serve as a reference for evaluating physiological hyperreactivity to mental stress for a group of ten variables which were significantly correlated with VO2 during graded exercise. 
Recurrent parotitis and sialectasis in childhood. Clinical, radiologic, immunologic, bacteriologic, and histologic study. Twenty children with juvenile recurrent parotitis, between 3 months and 16 years of age at onset, were followed up over a period of 7 to 22 years. Radiologic, histopathologic, cytologic, immunologic, and bacteriologic studies were performed to investigate the cause of sialectasis, commonly found in juvenile recurrent parotitis, and the pathogenesis of the disease. It was considered that a combination of a congenital malformation of portions of the salivary ducts and infections ascending from the mouth following dehydration of the children are contributory to the pathogenesis of the disease. The results of the investigations into the cause of the disease appear to exclude an auto-immunologic response or an allergic condition, an immature immune response, mumps, a sensitivity to upper respiratory tract infection, and familial factors. 
Efficacy of a postoperative regimen of enoxaparin in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in patients undergoing elective hip replacement, in whom the incidence of calf vein thrombosis is 40% to 60%; proximal vein thrombosis, 20%; and fatal pulmonary embolism, 1% to 2% when prophylaxis is not used. A double-blind, randomized trial comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) with placebo for the prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery was carried out. Prophylactic treatment with a fixed dose was begun postoperatively and continued for 14 days. Fifty patients in each treatment group underwent surveillance with 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. In the first 24 patients, venography was performed only if their surveillance test was positive. Venography was requested in the remaining 76 patients even if the screening tests were negative; in this latter group, venous thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (10.8%) given enoxaparin and 20 patients (51.3%) given placebo (p = 0.0002). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombosis were 5.4% and 23.1%, respectively (p = 0.029). In the entire group of 100 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 12% of those given enoxaparin and 42% of those given placebo (p = 0.0007). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombi were 4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.014). The observed hemorrhagic rate was 5% in each treatment group. The results of this study show that prophylaxis with fixed-dose enoxaparin is effective and safe for patients undergoing elective hip replacement. 
Engagement of interleukin-7 receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphoinositide turnover, and clonal proliferation of human T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The purposes of this study were to examine the biologic effects of the engagement of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) with recombinant human interleukin-7 (rhIL-7) in immunophenotypically distinct T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts and to elucidate the biochemical nature of the IL-7R-linked transmembrane signal in rhIL-7-responsive T-lineage ALL blast populations. In the absence of costimulants, rhIL-7 stimulated the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of freshly isolated leukemic blasts from six to eight T-lineage ALL patients with a mean plating efficiency of 196 +/- 53 (background subtracted) colonies/10(5) blasts plated. Stimulation of T-lineage ALL blasts with rhIL-7 resulted in markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of six distinct phosphoproteins with molecular weights of 57, 72, 98, 123, 150, and 190 Kd, and induced a rapid increase in the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3), which was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C inhibitor H7. Similarly, rhIL-7 stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production in CEM-1.3 T-lineage ALL cells and this stimulation was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, but not by H-7. Thus, the transmembrane signal triggered by engagement of the IL-7R is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine-specific protein kinase pathway and stimulates the phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and proliferation of T-lineage ALL blasts. The presented data confirm and extend previous studies on the expression of functional IL-7R on T-lineage ALL blasts and support the hypothesis that IL-7 may play an important regulatory role in the biology of T-lineage ALL. 
Late recurrent Candida endocarditis. Late recurrent Candida endocarditis (LRCE) developed on a prosthetic mitral valve 22 months after treatment for primary native mitral valve endocarditis. The LRCE was difficult to diagnose; results of two dimensional echocardiography and repeated blood cultures were negative. Only transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation and only lysis centrifugation blood cultures demonstrated candidemia. Postmortem examination revealed a large Candida vegetation on the prosthetic valve and Candida in the mitral valve ring. This case and a review of the literature indicate that Candida endocarditis treated with amphotericin B and prosthetic valve replacement may recur months after treatment, and that LRCE, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, may be best prevented by lifelong antifungal suppressive therapy. 
Successful excision of a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation following intraoperative embolization. Case report. The case of a 57-year-old woman with a 14-year history of progressive paraparesis is presented. Selective spinal angiography revealed a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a typical large size and rapid flow. The AVM was located primarily in the retromedullary space at the cervicothoracic junction. The AVM was successfully obliterated by intraoperative embolization using isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate and surgical excision. 
Spontaneous and corticotropin-releasing factor-induced cytosolic calcium transients in corticotrophs. Spontaneous and CRF-stimulated changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were studied in two types of corticotrophs: 1) cultured human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells (hACTH cells), and 2) identified small ovoid corticotrophs cultured from normal rat pituitaries. [Ca2+]i was monitored in individual corticotrophs by dual emission microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+ probe. In hACTH cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were carried out in combination with electrophysiological recordings obtained using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. It was shown that a single spontaneous Ca(2+)-dependent action potential led to a marked transient increase in [Ca2+]i in human tumoral corticotrophs. Spontaneous fluctuations in [Ca2+]i were also observed in unpatched corticotrophs whether derived from human pituitary tumors or normal rat tissue. Based on their striking kinetic features and their sensitivity to external Ca2+, we suggest that these spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients were the consequence of action potential firing. Under separate voltage-clamp (patch-clamp) conditions, tumor corticotrophs showed two Ca2+ current components: a low threshold, rapidly inactivating (T-type) current, and a higher threshold, slowly inactivating (L-type) current. The dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker PN 200-110 (100 nM) abolished the L-type current without affecting the T-type current, while the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (200 microM) suppressed both Ca2+ currents. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (5 microM) did not affect inward currents in tumor corticotrophs. Both L- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were involved in controlling [Ca2+]i transients in both tumor and normal corticotrophs, inasmuch as Cd2+ (200 microM) abolished [Ca2+]i) transients, while PN 200-110 (100 nM) greatly diminished, but did not completely abolish, [Ca2+]i transients. The latter did not appear to depend on a voltage-dependent Na+ influx, since they were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (5 microM). Corticotrophs generate [Ca2+]i transients in response to the hypothalamic secretagogue CRF by acting on their membrane excitability. Indeed, we demonstrated in combined fluorescent and electrophysiological experiments that CRF (100 nM) had a coordinate action on human tumoral corticotrophs comprised of a modest depolarization and an increase in the frequency of both action potentials and subsequent [Ca2+]i transients. A coincident increase in the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and after hyperpolarization was also observed in some CRF-stimulated cells. CRF (100 nM) evoked qualitatively similar [Ca2+]i patterns in human tumoral and normal rat corticotrophs not subjected to patch-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Detection of human papillomavirus DNA by in situ DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction in premalignant and malignant oral lesions. The sensitivity of detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in premalignant and malignant oral lesions by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were compared. With both methods HPV DNA was found in 4 of 24 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 4 of 14 cases of verrucous hyperplasia, and 1 of 10 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. The 10 cases of smokeless tobacco keratoses and 3 cases of verrucous carcinoma that we examined were all negative for HPV DNA. The PCR for the E6 open reading frame of HPV-16 correctly identified all cases that were positive by ISH. Only a single case that was positive by PCR was negative by ISH for HPV DNA. However, the PCR demonstrated the presence of HPV-16 infection in one case, which had hybridized most intensely with the probe for types 31/33/35 in the ISH. This discrepancy probably is due to the high degree of cross-hybridization in the ISH assay. PCR appears to be an effective technique for identifying HPV-16 DNA sequences in biopsy material from premalignant and malignant oral lesions. 
Neurogenic and nonneurogenic pain and inflammatory mediators. Pain is not a simple perception. Although millions of people suffer because of it and billions of dollars are spent trying to eradicate it, we are only in our infancy of understanding the very complex interactions necessary to perceive or distort our feelings of pain. We must continue to seek a better understanding of not only our patients' macroscopic impression of pain, but we must look microscopically at each cell involved in the whole of the pain process. A time will come when our molecular understanding will provide us with the means to unlock the secrets of pain. We have come a long way since the time of Descartes in our understanding of the neurophysiology and anatomy of pain, but we have a great deal more work to do if we are going to provide our patients with better remedies in the future. 
Sleep apnea and systemic hypertension: a causal association review. OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective systematic critique of five epidemiologic studies published in the English literature during 1978 to 1989 identified on Medline and manual literature searches. The evidence was evaluated using the standard observational criteria for causation: strength of association, consistency, dose-response relationship, temporal sequence, specificity, and biologic plausibility. RESULTS: We found evidence to support a causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in consistency and specificity and some evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Review of the data dealing with the mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and hypertension allowed us to advance several theories to provide support for biologic plausibility. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is a positive association--relative risk estimate between 1.3 and 40--for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, but the risk association is unstable. Thus, we believe that there is insufficient data to justify doing polysomnography as part of the routine diagnostic work-up for patients with hypertension. 
Blunt abdominal trauma resulting in intestinal obstruction: when to operate? The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial. Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management. We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days). Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases. In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management. Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected. We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered. This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management. 
Computed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or "black dots." The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. 
The controversy of heparin therapy as an adjunct to thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. Heparin is used routinely in the US as adjunct therapy for prevention of reocclusion after thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. A review of the literature shows controversy over the efficacy of heparin following thrombolysis. Both beneficial and a lack of beneficial effects have been reported with heparin. From a pathophysiologic viewpoint, there appears to be a need for full heparinization in the postlytic period because the residual stenosis is highly thrombogenic. However, optimal dose, time, and mode of heparin therapy has not been defined. Despite a lack of definitive data, it seems reasonable to administer intravenous heparin immediately after thrombolytic therapy to achieve a partial thromboplastin time 1.5-2.0 times control that is concurrent with an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin. These recommendations are consistent with the consensus opinion of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of amylase isoenzymes in thyroid cancer. The expression of amylase in various histological types of thyroid cancer was studied by an immunohistochemical technique, using a polyclonal antiamylase antiserum and two monoclonal antibodies specific for salivary and pancreatic-type amylases, respectively. Amylase was expressed in 21 of 24 (88%) thyroid cancers by polyclonal antiserum analysis. Analysis by monoclonal antibodies, however, showed that only 13 (54%) cases and three (13%) cases contained salivary-type and pancreatic-type amylases, respectively. Moreover, immunoreactivity for pancreatic-type amylase was detected only in medullary carcinoma; other histological types were positive for salivary-type amylase. These results show that thyroid cancer frequently expresses amylase, and suggest that the differences between amylase isoenzymes in thyroid cancer may correlate with those found between cellular origin of tumour. 
Lipid deposition and intimal stress and strain. A study in rats with aortic stenosis. These experiments were designed to study the topography of lipid deposition in the stenotic aorta of hypercholesterolemic rats, and to correlate it with flow conditions and intimal stresses and strains studied in a scale biophysical model and in a computer model. A 69% +/- 5% stenosis was produced with a U-shaped metal clip. One month to 8 months later, the aorta was studied en face by light microscopy after fixation and lipid staining. The intima in the throat of the stenosis was almost completely free of lipid, whereas symmetric lipid deposits occurred as bands just above and especially just below the stenosis; elsewhere lipid deposits appeared to be random. The flow data obtained from the scale model showed that the intima in the throat of the stenosis was subjected to an increase of as much as 20 times in shear stress, whereas the lipid deposits just above and just below the stenosis were associated with asymmetric flow conditions: the proximal area corresponded to a region of rapidly increasing shear stress, the distal area to a region of low to normal shear stress and separated flow. A finite element computer model based on the aortic deformations indicated that the endothelium at the inlet and outlet of the stenosis is subjected to a symmetric pattern of elevated stresses and strains. These results indicate that 1) the pattern of lipid deposition can not be adequately explained by a hypothesis based solely on flow conditions, and 2) lipid deposits can develop in areas of increased fluid shear stress, decreased fluid shear stress, and increased intimal strains. 
Angioplasty of long or tandem coronary artery lesions using a new longer balloon dilatation catheter: a comparative study. To determine whether or not a new 3 cm long angioplasty balloon was more effective in treatment of long (15-25 mm) or tandem (less than 25 mm overall length) coronary lesions, 44 consecutive patients with suitable lesions were alternately assigned to treatment with shorter, standard, 2 cm length, or long, 3 cm balloons. Primary success of PTCA was achieved in 95%. Those treated with long balloons required fewer inflations (3.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.7 +/- 2.1, P = .0001) and showed fewer moderate or severe intimal dissections of the lesions (4/22 vs. 12/22, p = .028). The use of 3 cm PTCA balloons in long or tandem lesions appears to be efficacious and less likely to cause dissections than shorter, 2 cm length devices. 
Invited review: electrodiagnostic assessment and monitoring of motor unit changes in disease. The motor unit characteristics change dynamically with disease. This is the basis for the use of neurophysiologic methods for diagnostic purposes and for long-term monitoring. A great variety of nerve conduction and EMG parameters are available to study the motor unit. They reflect different aspects of motor unit function. Therefore, the electromyographer must choose his technique and optimal parameters depending on the situation, type of condition, whether the purpose is diagnosis or monitoring, and so on. In this presentation the relationship between EMG parameters and physiologic and morphologic counterparts in some pathologic conditions will be discussed. 
Recurrent mild abruptio placentae occurring immediately after repeated electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy. We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy was performed repeatedly in pregnancy because of severe depression with psychotic features and failure of chemical treatment. Each electroconvulsive treatment was immediately followed by uterine contractions and active uterine bleeding, possibly representing recurrent abruptio placentae occurring in association with the treatment. Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation. 
Myocardial biochemical and hemodynamic adaptations to chronic tachycardia. The purpose was to determine the biochemical and hemodynamic adaptations of the myocardium to chronic tachycardia. Cardiac pacemakers were implanted in Yorkshire pigs and set at a rate of 180 beats/min for a period of 35-42 days. Animals were then anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Myocardial blood flow and hemodynamics were determined at three different heart rates (i.e., 120, 180, and 220 beats/min). Tissue samples were then taken for microsphere and biochemical analyses. Chronically paced hearts maintained better cardiac function and had consistently higher left ventricular blood flow with a higher endocardial-to-epicardial ratio. The activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were 23 and 45% greater in the paced hearts, respectively. The sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosinetriphosphatase activity was 55% greater in the paced hearts, whereas the myosin adenosinetriphosphatase was the same as in the control hearts. Polyacrylamide gels of the ventricular myosin isoforms showed only the V3 type to be present in both the control and paced hearts. These findings show that the heart of a large mammal adapts to chronic tachycardia (i.e., 180 beats/min) by elevating the aerobic and calcium-sequestering capacities without altering its myosin type. 
Infantile Pompe's disease, lipid storage, and partial carnitine deficiency. A diagnosis of infantile Pompe's disease (glycogenosis type II) was made by muscle biopsy on a 6-month-old infant boy seen with hypotonia, weakness, and developmental regression. Histochemistry and electron microscopy revealed a vacuolar myopathy with massive glycoge accumulation associated with increased neutral lipid as demonstrated on Oil Red O reactions. Pleomorphic, hypertrophic mitochondria with distortion of cristae and electron-dense deposits within the matrix were identified. Acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity was absent but associated with increased neutral maltase activity and a variable compensatory rise in activity of other lysosomal enzymes. Biochemical studies demonstrated low free carnitine, normal acylcarnitine, increased activity of carnitine palmityl and acyl transferases, and other enzymes of beta-oxidation with the notable exception of low normal beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. The explanation for the lipid accumulation is uncertain but is likely related to the combination of low carnitine concentration in muscle, low beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, representing a rate limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, and nonspecific defective mitochondrial function. 
Magnetic resonance images of brain stem infarct in periarteritis nodosa. A 35-year-old woman displayed unusual symptoms of progressive bulbar dysfunction. At necropsy, systemic necrotizing vasculitis and small pontine infarcts were demonstrated. The angiographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings are described. The latter investigation is a sensitive method for detecting such pontine lesions. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of magnetic resonance imaging findings of brain stem infarct in a patient with periarteritis nodosa. 
Double-blind study of Gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures. Forty-three patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Gabapentin (GBP) as add-on therapy in partial and secondarily generalized seizures. All patients were followed for an initial 3-month baseline period, after which they were randomly allocated to receive either a placebo or 900 or 1,200 mg/day GBP for 3 months. A statistically significant difference in seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment phase was noted between patients receiving placebo and GBP 1,200 mg, in whom seizure frequency decreased 57%. The GBP dosage of 900 mg appeared to be ineffective. A close relationship was observed between the serum GBP concentrations and the GBP dosage based on the seizure frequency. Serum GBP concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml resulted in a lower frequency of seizures. The adverse effects were minor and consisted mainly of transient drowsiness. GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of partial epileptic seizures in a dosage-related manner. 
Conventional MR neuroangiography. MR angiography of the brain plays an important role in the diagnosis of vessel thrombosis and dissection, giant aneurysms, and occult vascular malformations. This essay highlights some of the features of the intra- and extracranial circulation that make conventional MR neuroangiography valuable in the demonstration of vascular anatomy and vascular disease. 
Effects of magnesium sulfate on pentylenetetrazol-induced status epilepticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as an anticonvulsant is controversial. Status epilepticus was induced in 0.5% halothane-anesthetized Wistar rats with a threshold (90 mg/kg) or suprathreshold (200 mg/kg) dose of intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) under stereotactic hippocampal depth electrode monitoring. Fifteen minutes after seizure induction, the maximum hemodynamically tolerated dose of MgSO4 (10 mg/kg/min in 22 min) was administered i.v. MgSO4 was ineffective in altering seizure discharge. A subgroup of nine animals received hypertonic mannitol before MgSO4 to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate Mg2+ CNS penetration. Again MgSO4 was ineffective in attenuating epileptic activity. These results support the contention that MgSO4 is not an effective treatment for status epilepticus. We hypothesize that because Mg2+ blocks Ca2+ influx into the neuron through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated calcium channel in a voltage-dependent manner it would be ineffective in neurons that are continuously depolarizing as in status epilepticus. 
The neuropsychological sequelae of attempted hanging. Only one report on the neuropsychological sequelae of attempted hanging exists in the English language. Two cases of attempted hanging with subsequent isolated memory deficits are reported. Possible mechanisms for induction of this amnesia are discussed. In these two cases it is most likely that circulatory disturbance produced by the ligatures caused ischaemic hippocampal damage, which in turn led to amnesia. 
Valve extension with glutaraldehyde-preserved autologous pericardium. Results in mitral valve repair. Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue. For this reason, glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989. Ages ranged from 2.5 to 60 years (mean 19 +/- 15). The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever (69%), bacterial endocarditis (17%), congenital (8%), endomyocardial fibrosis (4.5%), and trauma (1.5%). The autologous tissue was fixed in a 0.62% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes. Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion. Associated mitral valve repair techniques (Carpentier's techniques) were mandatory in all patients. The period of follow-up extended from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.1 +/- 2.5 years). There were no operative deaths in this series, and there was one late death (2%). In the six patients (12%) who underwent reoperation, there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch. Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80% of the patients. This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction, allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced. It permits use of an adult-size prosthetic ring in children. Glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair. 
Unresectable pancreatic cancer: what is the optimal procedure? We retrospectively reviewed cases of pancreatic cancer to determine the benefit of various methods of biliary decompression and the role of prophylactic gastroenterostomy (GE) in management. Twenty-seven patients had only biliary bypass, and 26 had biliary bypass and GE. Operative mortality was similar for both groups (22% and 19%, respectively). The complication rates were almost identical (37% and 35%). Differences in operative mortality, incidence of cholangitis, and recurrence of jaundice were not statistically significant between patients having biliary decompression via the common bile duct or the gallbladder. Operative mortality associated with choledochoenterostomy was 33% versus 17% for cholecystoenterostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in 5% of patients who did not have GE. We conclude that cholecystojejunostomy is an effective method of biliary bypass. Because its addition did not seem to increase operative morbidity or mortality, we advocate GE at the initial exploration to prevent gastric outlet obstruction. 
Two-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of intracardiac masses in infants and children. We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes. The diagnosis was made noninvasively using two-dimensional echocardiography in all six patients. In five patients, surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results. Two-dimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children. 
Changes in sizes of cortical and lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It has been suggested that the degeneration of lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a transneuronal event, secondary to the loss of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, the cross-sectional areas of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the foot and tongue areas of the precentral gyri were measured in 12 cases of the classical sporadic form of ALS, and in 10 control subjects. The areas of motor neurons in the hypoglossal nuclei and in the ventral horns of segment L4 of the spinal cord were also measured. The number of neurons per 20 microns section of ventral horn or hypoglossal nucleus provided a more reliable index of severity of lower motor neuron loss at the time of death than did a semiquantitative score derived from clinical observations. Cortical neurons and lower motor neurons were significantly smaller in the cases of ALS than in the controls. In the cortex this change included, but was not confined to, the largest neurons. These observations indicate that shrinkage precedes neuronal death. There was no correlation, positive or negative, between the numbers of surviving lower motor neurons and the mean sizes of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the corresponding areas of the precentral gyri. The absence of such a correlation indicates that functionally related cortical and lower motor neurons probably degenerate independently, and not from a transsynaptic effect. Neuronal shrinkage has been observed in other diseases in which interconnected systems of neurons degenerate. The possible association of shrinkage with cytoskeletal degradation is discussed. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, usually manifested by frequent heartburn, occurs in approximately 10% of our adult population. The presence of a hiatal hernia is usually associated with, but does not necessarily cause, LES dysfunction, allowing acid reflux to produce esophageal and aerodigestive symptoms. The mucosa can be extensively damaged and, ultimately, a columnar lining, termed Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant condition, can develop. Treatment with H2-antagonists has been nirvana to some patients, but has proved only partially helpful to others. Adjunctive agents may increase relief and may help heal erosive esophagitis in some patients, but side effects and cost limit their use. Maintenance therapy with full doses is required, as the relapse rate for this chronic condition is high. Omeprazole temporarily heals almost everyone with otherwise resistant GERD, but it is currently used only on a short-term basis unless surgery, eminently successful in well-selected patients, is contraindicated. 
Multifocal independent epileptiform discharges in children: ictal correlates and surgical therapy. We obtained continuous EEG/video recordings on four children who had the interictal EEG pattern of multifocal independent epileptiform discharges (MIED). The prominent feature of their evaluation was the evidence that their clinical seizures appeared to be of focal origin; 42/44 seizures were manifested by "fencing postures." Three patients subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery: one focal resection of superior frontal-parietal cortex and two hemidecorticectomies. Seizure control improved in all three patients, and one patient is now seizure-free. Our patients differ from those previously reported in that they had a predominance of tonic seizures and had no history of infantile spasms or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Some patients, such as ours, with MIED may have clinical seizures of more focal origin than might be expected from their interictal EEG and, therefore, may benefit from resective epilepsy surgery. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the hand after placement of an arteriovenous graft for hemodialysis. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), a complex clinical syndrome characterized by pain and swelling of an affected extremity, is most commonly seen after trauma. We report the case of a woman with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure who presented with RSDS 5 months after placement of an arteriovenous (AV) graft for hemodialysis. The temporal relationship between RSDS and the vascular surgery suggests AV graft placement as the precipitating event for the development of RSDS. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids successfully relieved the patient's symptoms. We believe that RSDS should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained limb pain and swelling after AV graft placement. 
Pleomorphic melanoma mimicking sarcoma. Malignant melanoma may display a wide variety of unusual morphologic patterns that simulate unrelated neoplasms. The diagnostic approach to such complex and morphologically divergent lesions requires thorough and extensive scrutiny not only by routine light microscopy, but also by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation. We have reported the case of a patient with a mass on the heel exhibiting complex morphology that illustrates the value of such a systematic approach. 
Case of penetrating orbitocranial injury caused by wood. A case of retained intraorbital and intracerebral wooden foreign body following an orbitocranial penetrating injury through the lower lid of an adult is described. Initial failure to recognise the true nature of the injury led to intracerebral abscess formation and monocular blindness. Diagnosis and management of such cases are discussed. 
Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty: initial multicenter experience in 141 patients. Initial multicenter clinical experience with percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty is described for 158 lesions in 141 patients. Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis. 
Transient porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. We report a case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. Thrombosis of the portal vein and hepatic artery led to massive necrosis of the patient's first donor liver, necessitating its removal. After an 18-hour anhepatic period, a second donor liver was transplanted. During this interval, the patient was warmed with an infrared heat lamp that emitted bright visible light. Following the anhepatic period, a photodistributed cutaneous erythema was noted. The level of total serum porphyrins during the anhepatic period was significantly elevated at 1.548 mumol/L (normal, less than 0.018 mumol/L). Fractionation showed that the levels of the hydrophobic porphyrins, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were elevated, while the levels of the hydrophilic porphyrins remained normal. Following the successful second liver transplantation, the patient's porphyrin levels declined. This is the first reported case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. 
The bottom end. Handling of the perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection. There are a number of options for handling the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection, including open packing or primary closure with suction drainage. Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end. 
Chylothorax complicating right upper lobectomy. Chylothorax after pleuropulmonary surgery is unusual. We have described the case of a patient in whom this complication followed a right upper lobectomy. Early recognition is important to avoid potential morbidity and mortality. 
Syndrome of severe skin disease, eosinophilia, and dermatopathic lymphadenopathy in patients with HTLV-II complicating human immunodeficiency virus infection. Two intravenous drug users dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) developed an unusual severe dermatitis characterized by progressive brawny induration, fissuring, and ulceration of the skin, with an associated CD8 cell infiltration in one patient. Both patients had persistent eosinophilia. Lymph node biopsy revealed dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, an unusual pathologic finding in HIV-1 infection but one seen in association with mycosis fungoides and other skin disorders. Two new isolates of HTLV-II virus were established from these patients and were identified as HTLV-II by Southern blotting. This type of skin disease and lymph node pathology has not been found in other intravenous drug users who have been infected with HIV-1 alone or in patients in other risk groups for HIV-1 infection. HTLV-II may play a role in this unique new disease pattern in patients infected with HIV-1. 
Hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional-jump graft for facial reanimation without tongue atrophy. The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients. 
Traumatic rupture of the stomach after Heimlich maneuver. Fatal complications following the performance of the Heimlich maneuver have been reported. A 76-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with signs of respiratory distress, abdominal pain and distension one day after airway obstruction and subsequent resuscitation. Despite successful immediate laparotomy and repair of a ruptured stomach, she later succumbed to the sequelae of aspiration of gastric contents and dehiscence of the gastric tear. This is the 4th case of stomach rupture and the 7th reported fatal complication following the Heimlich maneuver. It is recommended that persons who undergo the Heimlich maneuver be examined and observed by a physician, as soon as possible, to rule out complications. 
A new mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy. A new autosomal-recessive mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn) is described. Homozygotes develop paralysis of the hindlimbs during the third week of life. Soon thereafter the forelimbs also become weak, and all mice die six to seven weeks after birth. Heterozygotes are normal. Skeletal muscles show neurogenic atrophy without histological signs of reinnervation. Axonal degeneration apparently starts at the endplates and is prominent in the sciatic nerve and its branches and the phrenic nerve. Axonal sprouts are abundant. There is no evidence of demyelination, and unaffected nerve fibers are normally myelinated. Sensory axons are spared. Almost all distal motor axons have disappeared in four to five weeks after birth. Ventral nerve roots show a reduced diameter of the largest fibers but no fiber deficits. The ventral horn cells show slight chromatolysis. The corticospinal tract is normal, but in terminally ill animals the fasciculus gracilis, the rubrospinal tract and possibly also reticulospinal fibers degenerate. The brain is histologically normal. The disease manifests itself in a dying-back fashion in the distal portion of the motor neurons and may represent an animal model of hereditary motor neuron diseases in man. 
Salmonella myonecrosis in a patient with diabetes mellitus. Bacterial myonecrosis is a medical and surgical emergency and prompt surgical intervention is critically important. A variety of microorganisms have been isolated from patients with necrotizing soft-tissue infections. These infections are frequently polymicrobial in etiology, but occasionally a single microorganism is isolated. This report describes a case of crepitant myonecrosis from infection with Salmonella serogroup B. 
Retinal thickness analysis for quantitative assessment of diabetic macular edema. Diabetic macular edema is a major cause of vision loss and is evaluated with qualitative or semiquantitative techniques. A new quantitative method for assessment of macular edema using retinal thickness analysis was applied to 19 patients with diabetic macular edema. Foveal thickening was frequently coupled with poor visual acuity. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and stereophotography detected 80% and 78% of local areas of thickening, respectively, but failed to detect locations with average thicknesses of 1.5 and 1.6 times normal, respectively. Fluorescein leakage on angiography was generally associated with retinal thickening, but locations with similar degrees of leakage had widely varying retinal thickening. Fluorescein leakage in the posterior vitreous correlated poorly with the degree of foveal thickening. These results indicate that quantitative measurement of retinal thickness may become useful in the management of diabetic patients with macular edema. 
Treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries. Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States. Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. 
The clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. 
Otologic sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis: a survey of 164 consecutive cases with a follow-up of 94 survivors. As part of a comprehensive study on sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis, 94 of 111 consecutive survivors were re-examined 4 to 16 years after discharge. Twenty-three patients had otological sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis. In these patients, 17 had hearing losses, 7 had tinnitus, 9 had vertigo, 13 had vestibular areflexia, 4 had loss of smell, and 3 had loss of taste. Among the patients with hearing loss, 4 were bilaterally deaf, 6 were unilaterally deaf, and 2 had mild and 5 had slight hearing losses. From correlations with extensive data from the medical records, preadmission antibiotic treatment appeared to protect from acousticovestibular damage. Purulent otitis media and otosurgical intervention did not correlate to the fatality rate or the development of sequelae. Acute purulent otitis media appeared as a concomitant manifestation, rather than the focus of pneumococcal meningitis. 
Fibrocystic disease of the breast in premenopausal women: histohormonal correlation and response to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog treatment. Sixty-six patients with fibrocystic mastopathy were enrolled in the trial after being selected according to clinical, radioultrasonographic, and histologic criteria. No characteristic hormonal profile was noted in most patients (52%). Estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, or both, were found in 57% of patients. Hormone receptor levels were correlated with atypical proliferative mastopathy (87.5%). Mastopathy was associated with a uterine fibroma or a fibromatous uterus in 73% of cases. All patients received intramuscular injections of a sustained delivery system (microcapsules) of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist [D-Trp6]-LHRH, Ipsen-Biotech, Paris) for 3 to 6 months. In case of partial response at 3 months, an antiestrogen (tamoxifen, 40 mg/day, for estrogen receptor-predominant lesions) or a progestin (cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/day, for progesterone receptor-predominant lesions) was added to the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist. A complete response was observed in more than half of the patients (n = 35, 53%) treated by [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone (n = 29) or associated with tamoxifen (n = 4) or cyproterone acetate (n = 2). A significant partial response was observed in 30 other patients (45%). Additionally, half of them received inhibitory drugs. The best responses were seen with cyst reformation (complete response, 100%) and fibrous block. Clinical responses to treatment with [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone were independent of hormone receptor status, but synergistic effects occurred with concomitant use of the corresponding inhibitory drugs. We conclude that chronic mastopathy, particularly when associated with uterine fibroma, can be successfully treated by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs in premenopausal women. 
Median lip fissure: etiology and suggested treatment. In a prospective study of 20 patients with median lip fissure, pedigrees were obtained. A hereditary predisposition for weakness in the first branchial arch fusion seems to exist. In some persons, more often in males than in females, this weakness eventually leads to development of a median lip fissure. The fissure becomes symptomatic when it is infected. In 10 patients the fissure was excised; in the other 10 patients excision was done in combination with a Z-plasty of the center of the lesion. The prognosis with the latter operation was superior to that with the former. 
Patient selection for mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Between 7/87 and 9/90 thirty-four patients underwent total artificial heart (Berlin Heart) (n = 2) or biventricular assist device (Berlin Heart) (n = 32) implantation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. The time of mechanical support ranged from 2 to 60 days, for a mean of 19.2 days. Twenty-three patients received heart transplants, with 74% 30-day survival and 52% long-term survival. Implantation of a mechanical support system became indicated in those patients whose hemodynamic and clinical condition deteriorated despite treatment with enoximone in addition to maximal sympathomimetic medication. The strategy to administer enoximone routinely was the result of a prospective study on 24 pretransplant patients in whom enoximone therapy reduced the need for mechanical assistance by 62%. At the time of device implantation shock-related organ impairment such as cerebral, renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction was present in 62% of patients. In addition, 7 patients had pneumonia. During mechanical support complete recovery of end-organ failure and resolution of pneumonia was observed in the majority of patients. The results indicate that end-organ dysfunction per se should not be considered a contraindication to mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. However, further clinical investigations are needed to identify predictive indicators of irreversible organ damage. 
Tissue plasminogen activator-associated lingual artery hemorrhage. Reported is the case of a patient with vertebrobasilar artery ischemia who received tissue plasminogen activator with resulting hemorrhage into the tongue and nearly exsanguinating hemorrhage from a branch of the lingual artery. Suggestions for immediate management of the hemorrhage as well as prevention are presented. As the use of thrombolytic agents increases and the list of their indications expands, unusual life-threatening hemorrhagic problems other than gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding will be seen, and management decisions may be life saving. 
A practical approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective study of 500 consecutive cholecystectomies was initiated with the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 96% of patients presenting with primary gallbladder disease and was completed in 95%. There were no deaths or bile duct injuries. Two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were transfused for postoperative bleeding, and only one patient required reoperation for any reason. A prospective study showed reduced operating time (20 minutes) and patient charges ($546) using electrosurgical dissection compared with laser. Reusable trocars were used without any associated injury or morbidity. An effective strategy for selective cholangiography was developed based on patient history, liver enzymes, and common duct diameter. In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be a safe operation. The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be enhanced ($1,271) with no loss of patient benefit using the combination of electrosurgery, reusable trocars, and selective cholangiograms in low-risk patients. 
Mammographically detected breast cancer. Results with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. At Yale-New Haven Hospital (New Haven, CT) treatment of early stage breast cancer with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS & RT) has been utilized with increasing frequency since the 1960s. The authors have reviewed their experience with specific reference to the outcome of those patients whose breast cancer was detected on routine screening mammography. To achieve adequate follow-up, only patients treated before December 1984 are included in this analysis. Of 438 patients treated with CS & RT before December 1984, a total of 41 patients (9%) had nonpalpable lesions detected on routine screening mammography and were treated with CS & RT to the intact breast. Only two patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy and no patients received adjuvant systemic therapy. There has been only one breast failure and one death due to cancer in this group of patients resulting in actuarial survival and breast recurrence-free rates of 100% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. These results stress the importance of routine screening mammography and raise questions regarding the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in this selected group of patients. 
Inhibition of Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced leukemia in transgenic mice expressing antisense RNA complementary to the retroviral packaging sequences. Recombinant plasmids pLP psi as and pCP psi as were constructed by positioning the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) proviral packaging (psi) sequences in reverse orientation under the transcriptional regulation of lymphotropic promoter/regulatory elements from the M-MuLV long terminal repeat or the cytomegalovirus immediate-early region. Linear fragments containing the antisense psi and the appropriate transcriptional regulatory sequences from these plasmids were introduced into the mouse germ line by zygote microinjection. The chromosomal integration, germ-line transmission, and lymphocyte-directed expression of the antisense psi RNA were confirmed. Control (nontransgenic) and transgenic mice containing either the pLP psi as or the pCP psi as sequences were infected with M-MuLV on the day of birth and assayed for signs of leukemia between 12 and 14 weeks of age with standard assay procedures. While 31% (11 of 36) of the control, nontransgenic, mice developed leukemia, none of the antisense psi transgenic mice developed any symptoms of leukemia. The pCP psi as sequences were also introduced into mouse NIH 3T3 cells and stably transformed cell lines were isolated. When infected with M-MuLV these cells were shown to produce virus devoid of packaged viral RNA. 
Mass screening in Japan increased the detection of infants with neuroblastoma without a decrease in cases in older children. Analysis of data from the Kanto-Ko-Shin-Etsu Branch of the Japan Children's Cancer Registry revealed that mass screening for neuroblastoma increased the detection of cases in infants younger than 1 year from about 25% before screening to about 50%, and the percentage of neuroblastomas among all pediatric cancers almost doubled, from approximately 10% to 19.3%. However, when the cases found on screening were subtracted, the numbers after the onset of mass screening were similar to those before screening. It is likely that neuroblastoma mass screening has identified a unique type of tumor, which may not be recognized without mass screening, rather than that it has contributed to the earlier diagnosis of tumors in older children. 
Usefulness of flecainide for prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Danish-Norwegian Flecainide Multicenter Study Group. To evaluate the efficacy of flecainide acetate in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter, 43 patients (23 men) (mean age 53 years) were randomized blindly to receive either placebo or 150 mg of flecainide twice per day for consecutive periods of 3 months. Attacks were verified by a minielectrocardiogram event recorder. If intolerable symptoms developed, the protocol allowed patients to cross over between treatments before the end of the first 3-month period. Four patients crossed over prematurely, between 1 week and 1 month, and 15 between 1 month and 3 months. The remaining 24 patients completed both 3-month periods. In all 3 treatment intervals, there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks during flecainide treatment (p less than 0.002). Complete suppression was seen in 15 of 43 patients (35%) treated with flecainide for 1 week, in 18 of 39 (46%) treated for 1 month and in 12 of 24 (50%) completing all 3 months in each period. Adverse effects were reported in 32 of the 43 patients (74%) treated with flecainide, but only 2 were withdrawals. One patient died suddenly. In comparison, 3 of 43 patients (7%) reported adverse effects in the placebo group. In conclusion, flecainide significantly suppressed the number of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Adverse effects were frequent but were mostly tolerable. 
Plasma renin activity in renal transplant patients with hypertension. Chronic renal allograft rejection (CR) is the major cause of graft loss after 1 year following transplantation. Hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (Up) are the hallmarks of this immunologic allograft response. Over 1 year, 23 patients posttransplantation and with HTN (diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg) were examined. Serial serum creatinine (Scr), Up, urine creatinine (Ucr), and resting and enalapril challenged (EC) plasma renin activity (PRA) were all determined. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by noninvasive imaging. Of the 23 patients, eight eventually lost their renal allografts, while 15 maintained satisfactory renal function (Scr less than 2.5). Results of this study show that: 1) worsening renal function (RF) increases EC reactivity; 2) the presence of proteinuria is not itself related to increase in EC activity; 3) renin before and after EC was higher (P = .06) in the allograft loss group. In this study, patients with high PRA represent the highest EC responses. Therefore, they display not macrovascular lesions, but microvascular intrarenal disease; this defect is most likely secondary to chronic immunologic insult. 
Gastrointestinal complications in 4473 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Thirty-nine gastrointestinal complications occurred in 35 of 4473 patients (0.78 per cent) who underwent surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass during an 8-year period. The mortality rate when one of these complications occurred was 22 (63 per cent) representing 11.5 per cent of the 191 deaths from all causes in the series. The relative risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication was 1:249 when the heart was not opened, 1:66 when it was and 1:5 after cardiac transplantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 20) was the most common complication of whom nine (45 per cent) died, followed by intestinal infarction (n = 12) with eight (67 per cent) deaths and acute pancreatitis (n = 6) all of whom died. There was one death after surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7). No patient survived bowel infarction without operation but resection was possible in five of the eight who underwent surgery, four of whom survived. The results demonstrate that surgical intervention is not associated with undue mortality but inappropriate conservative therapy is poorly tolerated in this high-risk group. 
Second operation after the failure of previous resection for epilepsy. We present our surgical experience with second operations in 15 patients with recurrent intractable partial seizures after resection for epilepsy. The interval from the first operation until the first recurrence of seizures ranged from 1 day to 7 months (mean, 62 days). The interval between the first and second operations ranged from 3 months to 12 years (mean, 38 months). Detailed video-electroencephalographic interictal and ictal recording was performed in all patients (invasive electrodes were used in 11 patients). Ictal onset was shown to be remote from the zone of previous resection in 3 of 15 cases (all 3 extratemporal and in the ipsilateral hemisphere). Recurrent seizures arose from the area of previous extratemporal resection in 2 of 15 patients, and from the area of previous temporal resection in 10 of 15 patients. Both cases of extratemporal recurrences and 3 of the 10 cases of temporal lobe recurrences in the area of previous resection were associated with residual unresected structural lesion. Of the 10 patients with local temporal recurrence, 6 had proven epileptogenicity in the residual mesial structures, and 4 had residual epileptogenicity in the unresected lateral temporal lobe. The patients have been monitored for 8 to 82 months (mean, 18 months) after the second operation: 7 patients (47%) have remained seizure-free and another 5 (33%) have achieved a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 90%. There was no mortality or significant morbidity in this series. We conclude that the extent and distribution of residual epileptogenicity after failed epilepsy surgery are highly variable. 
Low-back pain and disk degeneration in children: a case-control MR imaging study. Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 (26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up study. 
In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy of normal and pathological breast tissues. In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, at 1.5 T, in addition to magnetic resonance imaging and mammography, was performed on the breast tissue of 59 subjects, using a 40 mm or 80 mm surface coil for spectral localization. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, 46 control subjects; Group 2, nine patients with breast carcinoma; Group 3, four patients with benign breast disease. The relationship of age, menopausal status, breast size and pattern, use of contraceptive pill and history of breast disease to spectral characteristics of breast tissue was examined for the control group. In multivariate analysis, only menopausal status and age were found to be significantly related to tissue biochemistry. Pre-menopausal women had reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) (%) (p = 0.02), and increased phosphomonoesters (PMEs) and beta-nucleotide triphosphate (beta-NTP) (%) (p = 0.05), while the fat-to-water ratio was higher in older women (p = 0.02). No significant differences were identified between the control subjects and the patients with benign breast disease. When spectra from patients with breast carcinoma were compared with an age-matched volunteer group, alpha- and gamma-NTP (%) were found to be higher in the cancer tissue (p less than 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively), while PCr (%) was reduced (p less than 0.01). The ratio beta-NTP:PCr was higher in the carcinoma group of patients (p less than 0.05). In vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive examination which may prove useful in the early differentiation of malignant breast disease from normal and benign conditions. 
Preservation of urine voiding and sexual function after rectal cancer surgery In order to decrease the urinary and sexual morbidity which follows radical pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer, we began selective preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Between 1985 and 1987, 134 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative resection (52 abdominoperineal resections, 82 sphincter-saving resections) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and selective pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP). PANP was classified into five degrees depending on the extent of pelvic dissection. First-degree PANP indicates complete preservation of the nerves; second-degree PANP indicates destruction of the hypogastric plexus: third-degree PANP indicates partial preservation of the pelvic autonomic plexus; fourth-degree PANP indicates bilateral or unilateral preservation of only the fourth pelvic parasympathetic nerve; and fifth-degree PANP indicates complete destruction of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Most patients with first-degree PANP were able to spontaneously void 7-10 days following the operation. However, 78 percent (28/36) of patients with fifth-degree PANP had not regained bladder sensation by the third postoperative week and were discharged with an indwelling catheter; 58 percent (21/36) had not regained bladder sensation by the 60th postoperative day. The cystometric data indicate a progressive decline in bladder sensation and function with increasingly extensive pelvic dissection. However, preservation of only the fourth parasympathetic nerve (fourth-degree PANP) resulted in partial sparing of bladder sensation and voiding function. Evaluation of sexual function in males under 60 years of age revealed that only 31 percent (12/39) recovered erectile function and only 19 percent (6/39) recovered normal ejaculatory function in the first postoperative year. Most of these patients had complete preservation of their pelvic autonomic plexus (i.e., first-degree PANP). Four patients with partial PANP have recovered erectile function. Complete PANP is the best way to prevent urinary and sexual morbidity after rectal resection. The opposing goals of maximizing the chance for cure and minimizing morbidity must be individualized and balanced in each patient. Our data demonstrate that it is now possible to perform radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients with advanced rectal cancer with a minimum of voiding dysfunction. Preservation of sexual function in males is more difficult and depends on complete PANP and, as such, should be restricted to the group of patients with Dukes' A and B carcinomas. 
Expression of perforin in infiltrating cells in murine hearts with acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3. BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase. 
Management of foreskin problems. One hundred consecutive cases of boys with foreskin problems referred to local paediatric surgeons in the Edinburgh area were studied. Fifty five underwent circumcision and the remainder were managed more conservatively with or without the use of local or general anaesthetic. Although sometimes avoiding general anaesthetic, the more conservative methods involved more frequent visits to the clinic, a larger number of complications, and a longer follow up period. Despite the vogue for conservatism, circumcision still has an important part to play in the management of troublesome foreskins in children. 
Metabolic markers of stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The human heart in the fasting state extracts free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketones from circulating blood. The utilization of FFA accounts for most of the oxygen consumed and energy produced at rest. Patients with angiographically demonstrable coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris have a resting myocardial metabolism similar to that of normal individuals. During atrial pacing in normal persons, there is a significant enhancement of glucose uptake but that of FFA is unchanged, and the oxidation of carbohydrates accounts for more than 60% of the energy produced. In patients with stable angina, myocardial perfusion becomes regionally inadequate during stress. Despite the increase of myocardial glucose utilization, carbohydrate oxidation is negligible. Pyruvate will not be oxidized but in the presence of increased amounts of reduced coenzymes will be reduced to lactate. In addition, a greater amount of alanine will be released by the myocardium through the transamination of pyruvate, with a concomitantly greater uptake of glutamate that serves as the NH2 donor. In addition, glutamate may be used as an anaerobic fuel through conversion to succinate coupled with GTP formation. Although coronary hemodynamics, including myocardial perfusion, return to baseline within a few minutes after stress, a longer time course is needed for myocardial metabolism to become normal. In particular, myocardial utilization of exogenous glucose remains higher well after the normalization of hemodynamic parameters. This is more pronounced in postischemic myocardium, but it also occurs in nonischemic muscle, and glucose is presumably used for rebuilding glycogen stores that were depleted during ischemia. 
Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. 
Total occlusion of the circumflex artery with collateral supply from the conus artery. The conus artery has long been recognized as an important source of collateral blood supply to a significantly diseased left anterior descending artery. This artery which arises 50% of the time from a separate orifice in the right sinus of Valsalva may also provide collateral circulation to a diseased right coronary artery. To date, there have been no reported instances of the conus artery supplying collateral flow to a totally occluded circumflex artery. In this report we describe such a case in a patient with severe three vessel disease. The implications of such a finding in patient management are also discussed. 
Common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy. To assess the possibility of common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy, we made a retrospective study of patients who had ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The study comprised 52 patients without extrahepatic biliary obstruction; 19 had had cholecystectomy, 18 of whom complained of biliary colic similar to that they had had originally. The other 33 patients had intact, well visualized gallbladders; 15 of these patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, but none had chronic pancreatitis. The average diameter of the common bile duct at its widest point by ultrasonography was 4.8 mm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 mm) in the 33 patients with intact gallbladders, and 5.7 mm (range, 4.0 to 8.0 mm) in the 19 patients who had had cholecystectomy. The diameter by ERCP was 4.4 mm (range, 2.9 to 6.3 mm) in the patients with intact gallbladders, and 11.17 mm (range, 6.9 to 14.7 mm) in the patients who had had cholecystectomy. In each patient who had had cholecystectomy the diameter as measured by ERCP was larger than it appeared by ultrasonography. The results suggest that the common bile duct is distensible, and that this distensibility may be related to the postcholecystectomy syndrome. 
Can colon cancer incidence and death rates be reduced with calcium and vitamin D? It was proposed in 1980 that vitamin D and calcium could reduce the risk of colon cancer. This assertion was based on the decreasing gradient of mortality rates from north to south, suggesting a mechanism related to a favorable influence of ultraviolet-induced vitamin D metabolites on metabolism of calcium. A 19-y prospective study of 1954 Chicago men found that a dietary intake of greater than 3.75 micrograms vitamin D/d was associated with a 50% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer, whereas an intake of greater than or equal to 1200 mg Ca/d was associated with a 75% reduction. Clinical and laboratory studies further support these findings. A nested case-control study based on serum drawn from a cohort of 25,620 individuals reported that moderately elevated concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the range 65-100 nmol/L, were associated with large reductions (P less than 0.05) in the incidence of colorectal cancer. 
Selective contraindications based on multivariate analysis for operative cholangiography in biliary lithiasis. This study was done to select patients with a low risk of common bile duct (CBD) stones in whom operative cholangiography could be avoided. Operative cholangiography was performed upon 511 patients. Two different groups of patients were identified--patients with CBD stones visualized by CBD exploration (n = 90) and patients with no CBD stones at the time of operative cholangiography (n = 421). Multivariate analysis (stepwise logistic regression) showed that five variables were correlated with the presence of CBD stones--size of CBD equal to or greater than 12 millimeters, gallstones equal to or less than 10 millimeters, advanced age, chronic or acute cholecystitis and past history of biliary colic. Using a scoring system, a group of patients with a low risk (less than 2 percent) of CBD stones could be easily determined. In this group of patients, operative cholangiography may be avoided. 
A case for early surgery in native left-sided endocarditis complicated by heart failure: results in 203 patients From January 1982 to December 1988, 203 consecutive patients were selected for early valve replacement (mean 10 days from time of admission) if they had clinical evidence of native valve endocarditis with 1) vegetations on echocardiography, 2) severe valvular lesions, and 3) heart failure. Surgery was performed within 7 days of admission in 56% of patients and was done urgently because of hemodynamic deterioration in 108 (53%). All vegetations were identified by echocardiography and confirmed macroscopically at surgery. One hundred ten patients had isolated aortic valve infection, 50 had isolated mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05 for aortic vs. mitral) and 43 had double-valve infection. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57, 38 and 67 min, respectively. Sixty-four patients (32%) had extensive infection involving the anulus or adjacent tissues, or both; such infection more frequently involved the aortic than the mitral valve (p less than 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (35%) with aortic valve infection had abscess formation compared with 1 patient (2%) with mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05). Only eight patients (4%) died in the hospital. There were seven patients (3%) with a periprosthetic leak and five patients (3%) with early prosthetic valve endocarditis. Long-term follow-up, available in 174 hospital survivors (89%), revealed 10 deaths and two new ring leaks at 38 +/- 22 months. In conclusion, among patients with endocarditis who need surgery for heart failure, aortic valve infection is more prevalent than mitral valve infection and is more often associated with extensive infection, including abscess formation. 
Hemopericardium: a late complication after repair of pectus excavatum. Hemopericardium and tamponade occurred in a 12 year old boy with Marfan's syndrome, two years after surgical repair of pectus excavatum. This life-threatening complication resulted from penetration of a fractured metal plate through the pericardium into the right atrium. The clinical details are reported and discussed. 
Loss of transforming growth factor beta 1 receptors and its effects on the growth of EBV-transformed human B cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent negative regulator of normal human B cell growth mediated by exogenous signals, including IL-2 and low m.w. B cell growth factor 12 kDa (BCGF-12 kDa). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory linkage between viral or nonviral transformation of human B cells and the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. A panel of EBV+ and EBV- B cell lines, derived either by in vitro EBV B cell transformation, or from cases of lymphoma was used to quantitate the negative growth effects of TGF-beta 1. The proliferative response of three EBV- B cell lines to rBCGF-12 kDa or serum was inhibited by low concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.2-0.5 ng/ml for 50% maximal effect), as measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and viable cellular recovery. In contrast, rBCGF-12 kDa or serum mediated proliferation of three EBV+ B cell lines was refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) for this differential growth control in EBV+ and EBV- B cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta 1, c-myc, and TGF-beta 1 receptors. No correlation was observed between the expression of TGF-beta 1 or c-myc gene and growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 in the cell lines studied. Our results indicate that sensitivity or resistance to TGF-beta 1 correlated with the presence or absence (loss) of high affinity receptors for TGF-beta 1. EBV- B cell lines expressed levels of high affinity receptors similar to those found on activated normal B or T cells. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines showed no detectable high affinity receptors. Chemical cross-linking studies with a bifunctional reagent, dissuccinimidyl suberate revealed a normal expression of type I (65-70 kDa), type II (85-90 kDa), and type III (280-300 kDa) TGF-beta 1 high affinity receptors on EBV- B cell lines. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines did not express type I and type II receptors, whereas type III receptors were expressed but could not be inhibited by unlabeled TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Rare choroidal tumour simulating a malignant melanoma. A 15-year-old boy had been treated for a central chorioretinitis of his right eye. The other eye had always been normal. Two years later he presented a relapse with deterioration of central visual acuity. All clinical tests, including fluorescein angiography, suggested an inflammatory process this time again. Thereafter, the patient did not show up for 6 years. Then he came to hospital because of strong pains in his right eye. Now, a blind and inflamed eye was found with a huge tumour from the optic nerve extending to the temporal periphery. All clinical investigations, amongst others ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, suggested a choroidal melanoma with extrabulbar extension. An enucleation with partial exenteration was performed. A demonstration and discussion of the clinical findings and the rare and complicated histological diagnosis of a very unusual ectopic meningioma-like lesion are given. 
Cost-effective treatment of constipation in the elderly: a randomized double-blind comparison of sorbitol and lactulose. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of sorbitol as an inexpensive alternative to lactulose for treating constipation in the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty men aged 65 to 86 with chronic constipation were studied in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial in which lactulose and 70% sorbitol (0 to 60 mL daily) were each given for 4 weeks preceded by a 2-week washout period. RESULTS: The average number of bowel movements per week was 6.71 with sorbitol and 7.02 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.43 to 1.06), and the average number of days per week with bowel movements was 5.23 with sorbitol and 5.31 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.32 to 0.48). Eleven patients stated a preference for sorbitol, 12 for lactulose, and seven had no preference. On a visual analogue scale measuring severity of constipation (0 to 100 mm), the average score for sorbitol was 35.6 mm versus 37.1 mm for lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -6.4 to 9.3). The sorbitol and lactulose treatment periods were also similar in percent of bowel movements recorded as "normal," frequency and severity of symptoms such as bloating, cramping, and excessive flatulence, and overall health status as assessed by a previously validated five-category questionnaire. There were no significant differences between sorbitol and lactulose in any outcome measured except nausea, which was increased with lactulose (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that sorbitol and lactulose have no clinically significant differences in laxative effect. Sorbitol can be recommended as a cost-effective alternative to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in the elderly. 
The role of two-dimensional echocardiography in the diagnosis of ineffective endocarditis. Two-dimensional echocardiography has had a significant impact on and is considered the technique of choice for the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis. Over a thirty-six month period, 106 patients were evaluated by echocardiography for the possibility of endocarditis. The diagnosis of endocarditis was determined by strict clinical and laboratory criteria. All clinical histories, blood cultures, echocardiograms, and autopsy results were reviewed. Five echocardiograms were technically inadequate, resulting in a study population of 101 patients. The age of the patients ranged from forty-five days to eighty-eight years (mean fifty-seven years). The clinical manifestations of endocarditis included fever (83%), chills (60%), congestive heart failure (25%), and splenomegaly (18%). Twelve patients had preexisting valvular or congenital heart disease. Gram-positive cocci were the most common microorganisms. Complications included mitral regurgitation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, renal infarction, stroke, and a pulmonary embolus. The patients were divided into two groups: Group I consisted of 36 patients with definite vegetations by echocardiography, and Group II had 65 patients with no vegetations. In Group I, acute infective endocarditis was present in 35 patients, whereas only 4 patients had endocarditis in Group II. The sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiography for detecting endocarditis was 90%. The specificity was 98%. The predictive accuracy for a positive test was 97%, and the predictive accuracy for a negative test was 94%. Thus, two-dimensional echocardiography appears to have a high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in the evaluation of patients with suspected endocarditis. 
Unilateral erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli in a young girl. Erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli is uncommon. Fewer than 20 cases have been reported. Except for one case in a woman and one case of unilateral distribution, all other reported cases have been bilateral in young male patients. We report the first case of unilateral distribution in a white girl. 
Root of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations). Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm. 
Hyperglycemia-induced cholestasis in the isolated perfused rat liver. In a previous report we showed that cholestasis in diabetic rats is due in part to hyperglycemia. To gain information about the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, bile flow was studied in isolated perfused rat livers. The perfusion media were modified erythrocyte-free Krebs-Henseleit solutions. Under these experimental conditions, no cholestasis was observed in isolated rat livers obtained from rats treated with streptozotocin (6 mg/100 gm body wt) 6 days before the experiments. We then proceeded to use normal animals. The composition of the perfusion media was modified to maintain the osmolality even after increasing D-glucose concentrations from 0 to 35 mmol/L. Bile flow was not affected with doses up to 15 mmol/L D-glucose. Beyond a threshold value for plasma D-glucose concentrations between 15 and 20 mmol/L, cholestasis was observed. Using D-glucose analogs such as L-glucose and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, bile flow was also reduced (by 0.54 and 0.53 microliters/min/gm liver, respectively). Isosmotic sucrose-containing perfusion media were also observed to impair bile flow (by 0.66 microliters/min/gm liver). However, i-erythritol and D-mannitol failed to inhibit bile formation. The study of bile/plasma concentration ratios determined using tracer amounts of radioactive sugars indicated that this value was much lower for cholestatic sucrose (0.11) and L-glucose (0.31) than for noncholestatic i-erythritol (0.99) and D-mannitol (0.98). Cholestasis was partly reversed after induction by 35 mmol/L D-glucose if perfusion media were replaced by sugar-free ones, but also by media containing 25 mmol/L D-glucose. Insulin given during the perfusion with sugar-free media was observed to have no effect on bile flow. 
Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We reviewed 350 previously biopsied completely submitted clinical stage B radical prostatectomy specimens resected between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1988 in an attempt to identify the incidence of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking into periprostatic soft tissue. We identified 7 cases (2.0%) of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking, 3 in which the only tumor penetration in the gland was limited to the needle track. The maximal soft tissue extension from the biopsy site ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 cm. and approached the nearest soft tissue margin to within 0.5 mm. in 4 cases. In contrast to prior reports showing clinically evident tracking only with transperineal biopsies from high grade tumors, 6 of our 7 cases were of intermediate grade (in the glandular and tracking components) and 6 had transrectal biopsies. Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking occurred with core (14 gauge) and biopsy gun needles (18 gauge). An additional 13 cases (3.7%) showed some features of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking but they were equivocal. These findings have significant implications in light of recent proposals advocating serial mapping of prostate cancer using the biopsy gun with potential conservative observation of smaller tumors. 
Bilateral eyelid myxomas in Carney's complex. A 21-year-old man with a history of an excised soft tissue mass of the groin and spotty cutaneous pigmentation underwent excision of nodules of the right lower and left upper eyelids. The patient subsequently had a cutaneous mass of the left ear removed. All excised lesions were classified as myxomas. A diagnosis of multiple myxoma, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity (Carney's) complex was made. 
Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting with ondansetron: a randomized, double-blind comparison with placebo. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common after recovery from general anesthesia. The antiemetic effect and safety of ondansetron, a selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, was determined in 36 patients suffering from nausea or vomiting during recovery from intravenous anesthesia by giving either a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (8 mg, n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) over 2-5 min in a randomized, double-blind manner. A "rescue" antiemetic was provided in case of continued vomiting or at the patient's request. Antiemetic efficacy was defined as no request for rescue antiemetic and/or no vomiting episode during the next 4 h. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between the groups. Administration of ondansetron or placebo had no significant effect on vital signs. Ondansetron was an effective antiemetic in 78% (14/18) and placebo was effective in 28% (5/18) of the patients. Laboratory studies 24 h later showed no signs of hematologic, hepatic, or renal alterations. Ondansetron at a dose of 8 mg administered intravenously over 2-5 min appears to be a safe and effective antiemetic for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting after intravenous anesthesia. 
Copper deficiency in a genetically hypertensive cardiomyopathic rat: electrocardiogram, functional and ultrastructural aspects. The effect of copper deficiency on cardiac function and structure was studied in a strain of rats (SHHS/Mcc-cp) known to develop cardiac failure as adults. Restriction of dietary copper (less than or equal to 1 mg/kg vs. 6 mg/kg in adequate diets) at weaning in both sexes for a 6-wk period produced cardiac hypertrophy. Male rats developed more severe copper-deficiency symptoms than their female counterparts. In both sexes of copper-deficient rats, there was an increase in cardiac length, width, free ventricular wall thickness and septum thickness. Electrocardiographic tracings revealed greater QRS height among male copper-deficient rats. Heart rate also was substantially reduced in this group. The increased volume of myocardium occupied by mitochondria in the copper-deficient male rats might result in increased electrical resistance that would increase the QRS height; hypertrophy or anemia also could be contributory. Some male copper-deficient rats had prolongation of the QRS in a bundle branch block pattern. Maximal rates of rise and fall for left ventricular pressure were reduced in male copper-deficient rats. The gross histology indicated that this type of heart failure was more concentric than eccentric. The copper-deficient male rat may serve as a useful model for studying the concentric cardiac hypertrophy that occurs in humans. 
Giant, human immunodeficiency virus-related ulcers in the esophagus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients. 
Longer relapse-free period after sucralfate than after H2-blocker treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. In a prospective investigation of 2,045 patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease, the relapse-free period after acute treatment with sucralfate was evaluated over 1 year. This remission period was compared retrospectively with that achieved by previous treatment with a histamine-H2-blocker in the same patients. Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included. Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods. In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate. The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001). Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate. It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy. There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients. 
Tensile properties of the human femur-anterior cruciate ligament-tibia complex. The effects of specimen age and orientation. The structural properties of 27 pairs of human cadaver knees were evaluated. Specimens were equally divided into three groups of nine pairs each based on age: younger (22 to 35 years), middle (40 to 50 years), and older (60 to 97 years). Anterior-posterior displacement tests with the intact knee at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion revealed a significant effect of knee flexion angle, but not of specimen age. Tensile tests of the femur-ACL-tibia complex were performed at 30 degrees of knee flexion with the ACL aligned vertically along the direction of applied tensile load. One knee from each pair was oriented anatomically (anatomical orientation), and the contralateral knee was oriented with the tibia aligned vertically (tibial orientation). Structural properties of the femur-ACL-tibia complex, as represented by the linear stiffness, ultimate load, and energy absorbed, were found to decrease significantly with specimen age and were also found to have higher values in specimens tested in the anatomical orientation. In the younger specimens, linear stiffness (242 +/- 28 N/mm) and ultimate load (2160 +/- 157 N) values found when the femur-ACL-tibia complex was tested in the anatomical orientation were higher than those reported previously in the literature. These values provide new baseline data for the design and selection of grafts for ACL replacement in an attempt to reproduce normal knee kinematics. 
Stage IIB osteogenic sarcoma. Two hundred seventy-one consecutive patients treated from 1976 through 1986 were reviewed to estimate long-term survival. Disease-free survival for the entire cohort was 77% at five years and 74% at ten years. Humeral lesions had the best probability of survival (84% at ten years), followed by tibial lesions (81%) and femoral lesions (67%). Histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy was the strongest predictor of outcome. Those with little response had a survival estimate of 54% at ten years as compared to 68% for partial responders and approximately 90% for complete responders. Local recurrence was seen in 6.6% and was associated with an adverse effect on survival. Only two of the 18 patients with local recurrence have been rendered long-term disease-free survivors. 
Liver diseases unique to pregnancy. Severe liver diseases occur in less than 0.1% of pregnancies. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential to the health and survival of both the mother and fetus. Because of their low incidence and the fact that most pregnant women are cared for primarily by their obstetricians, gastroenterologists only infrequently encounter these diseases. This review is intended to update the practicing gastroenterologist on the complex spectrum of liver diseases unique to pregnancy. 
A comparison of the analgesic and respiratory effects of epidural nalbuphine or morphine in postthoracotomy patients. This randomized, double-blind study compared the analgesic and respiratory effects of lumbar epidural morphine 5 mg, nalbuphine 10 mg, and nalbuphine 20 mg in repeated doses in patients after thoracotomy; the first dose was administered intraoperatively. Pre-and postoperative monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and repeated arterial blood gas analysis. Postoperatively, visual analogue pain scores, somnolence scores, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases were determined for 16 h. Preoperatively, episodes of apnea were common during sleep but were not associated with low hemoglobin oxygen saturation or increased arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). During sleep, some otherwise normal patients had increased PaCO2, and 2 of 15 patients had episodes of hemoglobin oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Postoperatively, 1 and 2 h after arrival in the recovery room, patients who received morphine had lower pain scores than did those who received nalbuphine 10 or 20 mg (P less than 0.05). All 6 patients who received morphine had satisfactory analgesia. Two of 4 patients who received nalbuphine 10 mg and all 5 who received nalbuphine 20 mg were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate analgesia (morphine vs. nalbuphine 10 mg, not significant; morphine vs. nalbuphine 20 mg, P less than 0.01). Two patients who received morphine had persistently increased PaCO2 postoperatively. Two patients who received morphine had episodes of apnea and slow respiratory rate, which were most frequent 6 h after arrival in the recovery room. We conclude that lumbar epidural nalbuphine does not provide adequate analgesia after thoracotomy. 
Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV staining of cytologic preparations to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid diseases. Staining for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DAP IV [EC: 3.4.14.5]) activity was applied to aspiration biopsy specimens or imprint preparations of surgical biopsy specimens from thyroid tumors. Material was obtained from 55 patients with histologically proven thyroid diseases: 9 with papillary carcinoma, 5 with follicular carcinoma, 11 with follicular adenoma, 13 with adenomatous goiter, 8 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 9 with other benign conditions. Most tumor cells, follicular lumina in cell clusters, and intranuclear inclusions were strongly positive for DAP IV in all examples of papillary or follicular carcinoma. In contrast, only a few epithelial cells were labeled for DAP IV in follicular adenoma and adenomatous goiter. Some Hurthle cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis also were positive for DAP IV. When a DAP IV scoring system based on the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity was used, all benign tissues except one (from a follicular adenoma) were found to have extremely low scores. These results indicate that staining for DAP IV activity is a simple but useful tool to aid in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms. 
The performance of two tympanic thermometers in a pediatric emergency department. In a prospective, unblinded, controlled study, 303 children underwent comparison of rectal (RT) and right-sided tympanic membrane (TMT) temperatures. Digital electronic thermometers were used for RT, while two different infrared detection devices assessed TMT. The performance of TMT devices were compared using correlation with RT, fever detection, and ease of use. Correlation between RT and the two devices was good, r = 0.70 and r = 0.69, with little influence of patient age on performance. Using receiver operating characteristics curves to assess fever screening. Thermoscan performed somewhat better than First Temp. Staff rated the Thermoscan as significantly easier to use. 
Gene mapping in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal seizures, and early childhood myoclonic epilepsy. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies, i.e., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), childhood absence epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal [generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)], are the most common genetic epilepsies. Linkage studies using Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers by three independent investigators, one from Los Angeles and two from Berlin, have localized the JME locus to the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p). Because members of the same JME family have the same JME phenotype of childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or early childhood myoclonic epilepsy (ECME), our observations give evidence for a single-locus etiology in 6p for JME and for at least some of the childhood absence seizures, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, and ECME. Studies should now address whether locus heterogeneity exists within childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or ECME. Markers linked to JME (Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers in the DQ region) can be used to resolve etiologic heterogeneity. Using such markers, both linked and unlinked forms of phenotypes that are clinically indistinguishable may be detected and provide evidence for etiologic heterogeneity. Studies should also concentrate on narrowing the JME locus to 2 to 3 cm by screening families with recombinant events using RFLPs, candidate genes, and new expressed sequences on chromosome 6. 
An open label study of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Ten patients with advanced cancer and breakthrough pain between the ages of 39 and 78 received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (10-15 micrograms/kg) 4 or 5 times each over 2 days (42 total administrations) in an open study. Baseline vital sign and rating scale results did not vary over administrations, except for heart rate which showed an 8 beats/min decrease over 4 administrations. Heart rate and oxygen saturation did not vary significantly over 120 min of evaluation, and minimal changes in blood pressure and respiration rate were found. Significant reduction in pain scores as measured by a pain descriptive scale, the McGill-Melzack scale, and a numeric (VAS) scale were seen at all evaluations from 5 to 120 min. Average time to onset of pain relief was 9.5 min after administration. Wellbeing was significantly increased at all evaluations. Activity level as recorded by the investigator was significantly reduced from 10 to 30 min after administration, however, activity level as reported by the patient was significantly increased at 5 min and from 60 to 120 min after OTFC administration. There were no significant adverse effects. 
Protection against infarction afforded by preconditioning is mediated by A1 adenosine receptors in rabbit heart. BACKGROUND. Preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia followed by 10 minutes of recovery) renders the heart very resistant to infarction from subsequent ischemia. This study tests whether adenosine receptors might mediate preconditioning protection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the effect on infarct size of pretreatment with either of two adenosine receptor antagonists in both control and preconditioned in situ rabbit hearts. Hearts underwent 30 minutes of regional ischemia plus 3 hours of reperfusion, and infarct size was measured with tetrazolium. Infarct size averaged 39% of the zone at risk in controls but only 8% in preconditioned hearts. Preconditioned and nonpreconditioned hearts receiving either blocker had infarcts not different in size from the controls. A 5-minute intracoronary infusion of adenosine was as effective as 5 minutes of ischemia in protecting parabiotically perfused isolated hearts against infarction from a 45-minute ischemic insult. Similarly, intracoronary infusion of N6-1-(phenyl-2R-isopropyl)adenosine, an A1-selective adenosine receptor agonist, at a dose that delayed conduction but did not dilate the coronary vessels, also limited infarct size. The protection disappeared when we reduced the coronary concentration of drug by intravenous infusion of adenosine, indicating that cardiac rather than peripheral receptors were involved in the protection. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that adenosine released during the preconditioning occlusion stimulates cardiac A1 receptors, which leaves the heart protected against infarction even after the adenosine has been withdrawn. 
A CD18 monoclonal antibody increases the incidence and severity of subcutaneous abscess formation after high-dose Staphylococcus aureus injection in rabbits. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 60.3 blocks CD18-dependent polymorphonuclear neutrophil adherence to endothelium and has been shown to be of benefit in preventing tissue injury in a variety of inflammatory conditions. However, concern exists that interference with normal polymorphonuclear neutrophil host-defense functions may increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. We compared the development of subcutaneous Staphylococcus aureus abscesses in rabbits pretreated with MAb 60.3 to those pretreated with saline placebo. Bacterial inoculation with 10(6) or 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) did not result in abscess formation in either control or antibody-treated groups. However, inoculation with 10(8) CFU resulted in more frequent and larger abscesses in antibody-treated rabbits than in controls. Abscess incidence was similar for inoculation with 10(9) CFU, although antibody-treated rabbits developed larger abscesses than did controls. The difference in abscess development is due to delayed leukocyte migration into inoculated tissue. The results of these experiments suggest that subjects treated with MAb 60.3 and exposed to massive S. aureus inocula may be at serious risk of infection. However, despite inhibited leukocyte adhesion, inocula of up to 10(7) CFU were well tolerated in this model. Whether these findings are clinically important remains to be determined, although exposure to bacterial concentrations of 10(8) CFU or greater occurs only rarely in clinical practice. 
The frequency and significance of ECG changes after transurethral prostate resection. Although many clinicians routinely recommend a base-line preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and obtain frequent postoperative ECGs to screen for myocardial infarction or ischemia, the diagnostic utility of screening perioperative ECGs is unknown. The present analysis evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the perioperative ECG and examines its value as a predictor of early postoperative cardiac events and outcomes during the postoperative year. ECGs obtained preoperatively and on the first 3 postoperative days in 206 men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were analyzed using the Minnesota Code. The occurrence of cardiac events during the operative stay was assessed by measurement of the cardiospecific MB creatine kinase isoenzyme on the first 3 postoperative days and review of the entire clinical course. Twenty-one percent of patients developed postoperative ECG changes, mostly involving the T wave; none had cardiac symptoms or sustained creatine kinase MB elevation. Changes were not significantly more common in men known to have coronary disease. The single patient who had a perioperative myocardial infarction confirmed by enzymes had no codable ECG changes. The specificity of any ECG change for perioperative infarction was 78%; of ST segment changes only, 95%. Only one of the patients (2%) who had postoperative ECG changes had a cardiac event in the year after surgery. Routine perioperative ECGs is of little diagnostic/predictive utility in situations in which the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is low. 
MR imaging of synovial sarcoma. The MR imaging findings in 12 cases of synovial sarcoma are illustrated. The MR appearance most indicative of the tumor is an inhomogeneous septated mass with infiltrative margins located close to a joint, a tendon, or bursae, especially if soft-tissue calcification can be seen on CT scans or plain radiographs. 
Hormone replacement therapy and coronary heart disease. Proper use of postmenopausal hormone replacement has been the subject of debate for decades. Prevailing medical opinion has swung between enthusiastic endorsement and extreme caution. The wave of optimism over estrogen's beneficial effects on menopausal symptoms and skeletal health was temporarily set back by the evidence that linked estrogen to endometrial cancer. Once studies showed that progestogen cotherapy could protect against this adverse effect, physicians were again encouraged to prescribe hormone replacement. Since 1980, increasing epidemiologic and experimental evidence has suggested a hitherto unappreciated and immense CHD health benefit from use of postmenopausal estrogen therapy. Although addition of progestogen may offset the cardiovascular benefits of estrogen slightly, its use is reasonable and practical. No woman need be subjected to unopposed estrogen's carcinogenic effects on her endometrium. Based on available evidence, hormone replacement therapy, appropriately administered, is both safe and beneficial. Unfortunately, there is no single way to prescribe it. The treating physician must make a series of best judgments. Practically speaking, this entails, in each case, finding the form of therapy that is acceptable to the patient and that provides the greatest health benefits with the least likelihood of adverse affects. Our prescribing habits have evolved in the last 15 to 20 years. We have better discrimination of the woman most likely to benefit; improved therapy through use of newer formulations, dosages, routes, and schedules; and more appropriate implementation of monitoring procedures. Although questions remain, we should not let our imperfect knowledge dissuade us from more widespread prescribing of hormone replacement therapy. 
Mechanism of the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure. Minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and metabolic gas exchange were measured continuously during maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise in 30 patients with stable chronic heart failure. The ventilatory response to exercise was assessed by calculation of the slope of the relation between minute ventilation and rate of carbon dioxide production. There was a close correlation between the severity of heart failure, determined as the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, and the ventilatory response to exercise. Reanalysis of the data after correction for ventilation of anatomical dead space did not significantly weaken the correlation but reduced the slope of the relation by approximately one third. These results show that the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure is largely caused by mechanisms other than increased ventilation of anatomical dead space. This finding supports the concept that a significant pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch develops in patients with chronic heart failure and suggests that the magnitude of this abnormality is directly related to the severity of chronic heart failure. 
Endoscopic balloon dilatation as a therapeutic option in the management of intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was undertaken in seven patients who presented with obstructive symptoms resulting from Crohn's disease. Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture. The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated. Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery. 
Adrenergic hypersensitivity after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Withdrawal of beta-blocker therapy has been associated with the development of adrenergic hypersensitivity and adverse clinical effects in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the occurrence and clinical significance of adrenergic hypersensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockade in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic sensitivity was measured using the isoprenaline chronotropic dose25. Symptom assessment chronotropic dose25 calculation, bicycle exercise, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed while the patient received beta-blocker therapy and repeated on days 2, 4, 6, 8 (acute withdrawal period) and on day 21 after abrupt withdrawal. The study was terminated after 7 patients had been studied because all patients experienced a marked deterioration in symptoms and several clinical events had occurred. The chronotropic dose25 (mean +/- standard deviation) demonstrated beta 1-adrenergic hypersensitivity with a minimal value of 1.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms during the acute withdrawal period compared with 3.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms on day 21 (p = 0.003). Heart rates during rest and exercise showed an overshoot increase during the acute withdrawal period. The maximal 24-hour ventricular ectopic count was higher during the acute withdrawal period than during day 21 (p = 0.04). Of 3 patients with inducible outflow tract gradients, 2 developed resting gradients greater than 30 mm Hg during the acute withdrawal period. There was an increase in peak late filling velocity of mitral inflow after beta-blocker withdrawal. In conclusion, transient beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is associated with significant physiologic changes and adverse clinical consequences. 
Pediatric fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A total of 135 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies from varying sites were performed in 123 children (mean, 10.5 years; range, one day to 18 years) over a five-year period. One hundred thirty (96.3%) biopsy specimens were satisfactory for evaluation. Seventy-nine cases were nonneoplastic (60.8%); among these cases, a specific diagnosis of infectious disease was made in 17 (13.1%). A diagnosis of neoplastic disease was made in 50 (38.5%) cases, of which 14 (10.8%) were benign, 28 (21.5%) were malignant, and 8 (6.2%) were neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential. The sensitivity of pediatric FNA biopsies was 90.6%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 94.7%, and efficiency of the test 96.5%. There were no false-positive diagnoses and there were four false-negative diagnoses, three of which involved aspirates of the central nervous system (CNS). Ancillary studies, including immunocytochemistry (20 cases), electron microscopic examination (18 cases), microbiologic culture (8 cases), cytogenetic studies (7 cases), and flow cytometry (3 cases), were performed on the aspirated material, enabling a more specific diagnosis or supplying additional information in many cases. Definitive diagnosis by FNA biopsy enabled radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to be administered for unresectable malignant neoplasms, provided material for culture of infectious lesions, identified benign lesions not needing surgery, and aided the surgeon in planning the extent of surgery in resectable malignant neoplasms. These results support the greater use of FNA biopsy in the pediatric population. 
Effects of interferon on intrahepatic human leukocyte antigens and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis. 
Anti-MY9-blocked-ricin: an immunotoxin for selective targeting of acute myeloid leukemia cells. The use of immunotoxins (IT) to selectively destroy acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vivo or in vitro is complicated by both the antigenic similarity of AML cells to normal progenitor cells and the difficulty of producing a sufficiently toxic conjugate. The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) anti-MY9 is potentially ideal for selective recognition of AML cells because it reacts with an antigen (CD33) found on clonogenic AML cells from greater than 80% of cases and does not react with normal pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we describe an immunotoxin that is selectively active against CD33+ AML cells: Anti-MY9-blocked-Ricin (Anti-MY9-bR), comprised of anti-MY9 conjugated to a modified whole ricin that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemical blockage of the galactose binding domains of the B-chain. A limiting dilution assay was used to measure elimination of HL-60 leukemic cells from a 20-fold excess of normal bone marrow cells. Depletion of CD33+ HL-60 cells was found to be dependent on the concentration of Anti-MY9-bR and on the duration of incubation with IT at 37 degrees C. More than 4 logs of these leukemic cells were specifically depleted following short exposure to high concentrations (10(-8) mol/L) of Anti-MY9-bR. Incubation with much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR (10(-10) mol/L), as compatible with in vivo administration, resulted in 2 logs of depletion of HL-60 cells, but 48 to 72 hours of continuous exposure were required. Anti-MY9-bR was also shown to be toxic to primary AML cells, with depletion of greater than 2 logs of clonogenic cells following incubation with Anti-MY9-bR 10(-8) mol/L at 37 degrees C for 5 hours. Activity of Anti-MY9-bR could be blocked by unconjugated Anti-MY9 but not by galactose. As expected, Anti-MY9-bR was toxic to normal colony-forming unit granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), which expresses CD33, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and also to burst-forming unit-erythroid and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, although to a lesser extent. When compared with anti-MY9 and complement (C'), Anti-MY9-bR could be used in conditions that provided more effective depletion of AML cells with substantially less depletion of normal CFU-GM. Therefore, Anti-MY9-bR may have clinical utility for in vitro purging of AML cells from autologous marrow when used at high IT concentrations for short incubation periods. Much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR that can be maintained for longer periods may be useful for elimination of AML cells in vivo. 
Nerve growth and expression of receptors for nerve growth factor in tumors of melanocyte origin. Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates growth and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. It is not known what role NGF plays in melanoma development, but nevus and malignant melanoma cells express NGF-receptor (NGF-R). We counted nerve fibers within melanocytic nevi, primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous melanoma metastases using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) as marker against a 200-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on human nerves. The expression of NGF-R was studied in serial cryostat sections using a MoAb against the NGF-R. Compared to normal skin, increased numbers of nerve fibers were found in 72 melanocytic nevi. In congenital nevi their number significantly increased with age. In 47 primary cutaneous melanomas the number of nerve fibers decreased in proportion to tumor thickness. In 33 cutaneous melanoma metastases no accumulation of nerve fibers was found. NGF-R was not expressed in normal skin melanocytes and in the majority of nevus cells in melanocytic nevi. Considerable numbers of NGF-R-positive nervus cells were found only in some congenital nevi and few acquired nevi with dysplastic features. By contrast, in primary and metastatic melanomas higher expression of NGF-R was observed. The increased number of nerve fibers in melanocytic nevi suggests that neurite-promoting factors are produced in situ. Production of such factors appears to be lost in malignant melanoma cells. The finding of an inverse correlation between an abundance of nerve fibers in NGF-R-poor nevi and a high expression of NGF-R in melanomas that show no evidence of nerve growth suggest a role of NGF and its receptor in malignant melanocytic tumors. 
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: megalencephaly and heterotopic gray matter. A 3-month-old white male with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), facial deformities, brain malformations, and cortical blindness is presented. Facial deformities included left ear hypertrophy and a left-sided hamartomatous neck mass. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS. 
The neurology of aging: normal versus pathologic change. Mild changes in neurologic function occur with aging but generally do not substantially interfere with everyday activities unless disease intervenes. Not infrequently, older adults experience minor impairment in memory, speed of cognitive processing, sleep, vision and hearing, vibratory sense in the lower extremities, and gait and posture. In general, these changes correspond with age-associated neuroanatomic changes (eg, diminished brain weight), but there is wide variability in the extent to which these changes occur. Often, "normal" neurologic changes are difficult to distinguish from impairment associated with disease. 
In vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of early disc degeneration with histopathologic correlation. The in vivo and ex vivo microanatomic appearance of early disc degeneration were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and correlated with their respective histopathologic findings. Five cadaver spines (18 discs) and 25 patient studies (122 discs) all imaged at 1.5 Tesla were studied. Two signs of early degenerative disc disease were found: infolding and the central dot. Infolding of the central fibers of the outer annulus coalesced into a central dot of low signal intensity that was seen on both the ex vivo and in vivo images. Infolding was seen 29 of 122 times, and the central dot was observed 15 to 122 times on the in vivo images. A later form of degenerative disc disease was identified as a separation of the nucleus pulposus from the hyaline cartilage end-plate. This separation was seen as a linear area of either low or high signal intensity on the ex vivo images but only as a band of high signal intensity on the in vivo spin-echo 2,500-msec/80-msec images. Only 7 of 122 in vivo discs showed this separation. Internal herniation of nucleus pulposus into the outer annulus was seen only on the ex vivo images. Early degenerative disc disease may exist before there is loss of disc height or signal intensity on the long time-to-repetition (TR)/time-to-echo (TE) magnetic resonance images. 
Neoplastic disease of the spine. In summary, MR imaging has become the single most effective modality for the evaluation of spinal neoplasms by virtue of its ability to image the spinal cord directly and noninvasively. In this fashion, one can localize mass lesions relative to the spinal cord; in conjunction with the patient's clinical history, it is thus possible to provide a brief yet accurate differential diagnosis. Intravenous paramagnetic contrast enhancement also may prove extremely useful in further delineating such lesions. In addition, it has demonstrated a high sensitivity to primary and secondary tumors of the bony spine through its ability to detect subtle T1 signal changes in the vertebral marrow space. 
Identification of p53 gene mutations in bladder cancers and urine samples. Although bladder cancers are very common, little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. In this study, invasive bladder cancers were evaluated for the presence of gene mutations in the p53 suppressor gene. Of 18 tumors evaluated, 11 (61 percent) were found to have genetic alterations of p53. The alterations included ten point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, and one 24-base pair deletion. In all but one case, the mutations were associated with chromosome 17p allelic deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene products. Through the use of the polymerase chain reaction and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations were identified in 1 to 7 percent of the cells within the urine sediment of each of three patients tested. The p53 mutations are the first genetic alterations demonstrated to occur in a high proportion of primary invasive bladder cancers. Detection of such mutations ex vivo has clinical implications for monitoring individuals whose tumor cells are shed extracorporeally. 
Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct, depressive, anxiety, and other disorders. OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology. Little is known about the comorbidity of this disorder with disorders other than conduct. Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders. DATA COLLECTION: The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder. FINDINGS: The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders. These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses. Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies. Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Evaluation of combination thrombolytic therapy and timing of cardiac catheterization in acute myocardial infarction. Results of thrombolysis and angioplasty in myocardial infarction--phase 5 randomized trial. TAMI Study Group Recent trials of myocardial reperfusion using single-agent thrombolytic therapy and sequential cardiac catheterization have supported a conservative approach to the patient with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate combination thrombolytic therapy and the role of a previously untested strategy for the aggressive use of cardiac catheterization, we performed a multicenter clinical trial with a 3 x 2 factorial design in which 575 patients were randomly allocated to one of three drug regimens--tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 191), urokinase (n = 190), or both (n = 194) - and one of two catheterization strategies--immediate catheterization with angioplasty for failed thrombolysis (n = 287) or deferred predischarge catheterization on days 5-10 (n = 288). Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, cardiogenic shock, or age of more than 75 years were excluded. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved and almost identical at predischarge catheterization (54%), regardless of the catheterization or thrombolytic strategy used (p = 0.98). Combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with a less complicated clinical course, most clearly documented by a lower rate of reocclusion (2%) compared with urokinase (7%) and t-PA (12%) (p = 0.04) and a lower rate of recurrent ischemia (25%) compared with urokinase (35%) and t-PA (31%). When a composite clinical end point (e.g., death, stroke, reinfarction, reocclusion, heart failure, or recurrent ischemia) was examined, combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with greater freedom from any adverse event (68%) compared with either single agent (urokinase, 55%; t-PA, 60%) (p = 0.04) and with a less complicated clinical course when the composite clinical end points were ranked according to clinical severity (p = 0.024). Early patency rates were greater with combination therapy, although predischarge patency rates after considering interventions to maintain patency were similar among drug regimens. No difference in bleeding complication rates was observed with any thrombolytic regimen. The aggressive catheterization strategy led to an overall early patency rate of 96% and a predischarge patency rate of 94% compared with a 90% predischarge patency in the conservative strategy (p = 0.065). The aggressive strategy improved regional wall motion in the infarct region (-2.16 SDs/chord) compared with deferred catheterization (-2.49 SDs/chord) (p = 0.004). More patients treated with the aggressive strategy were free from adverse outcomes (67% versus 55% in the conservative strategy, p = 0.004), and the clinical course was less complicated when the adverse outcomes were ranked according to severity (p = 0.016). No significant increase in use of blood products resulted from the aggressive strategy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Retained bile duct stones in a patient with Billroth II gastrectomy: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation via T tube. A postoperative T tube cholangiogram after cholecystectomy in a 62 year old patient showed two retained calculi of 14 mm diameter each. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was not possible because of previous Billroth II gastrectomy. The stones were disintegrated by electromagnetically generated extracorporeal shock waves. The T tube was replaced by a balloon catheter and the papilla of Vater was dilatated allowing passage of stone fragments. We conclude that retained bile duct stones can be removed without sphincterotomy or percutaneous extraction by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation. This method should be considered especially in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy. 
Failure of ursodeoxycholic acid to prevent a cholestatic episode in a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis: a study of bile acid metabolism. Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered to a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis to prevent cholestatic episodes. A detailed study of bile acid metabolism in this patient was carried out in the anicteric and icteric phases before and after ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) administration. Urinary, biliary and serum bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. During the anicteric phase the daily urinary excretion and serum concentrations of bile acids were within normal ranges, indicating normal hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids during the cholestasis-free period. Only slight qualitative differences from normal individuals were observed; the relative proportions of deoxycholic acid in the bile and serum were higher, and 12-oxo-lithocholic acid was the predominant urinary bile acid. During the icteric phase a marked increase in the urinary excretion of primary bile acids and C-1, C-2, C-4 and C-6 hydroxylated metabolites was found. Serum bile acid concentrations increased before the rise in bilirubin, suggesting an acute disturbance in bile acid transport at the onset of the cholestatic attack. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration in the anicteric phase, bile became enriched with the exogenous bile acid, but little qualitative change was found in the other metabolites present in the urine, serum or bile during the anicteric or icteric phases. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid failed to prevent recurrence of a cholestatic episode, suggesting that in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, oral ursodeoxycholic acid may be of little benefit in the treatment or prevention of cholestasis despite marked enrichment of the bile acid pool with this hydrophilic bile acid. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Sudden asphyxial death due to a prolapsed esophageal fibrolipoma. Fibrolipomas of the esophagus are extremely uncommon benign tumors. Accurate diagnosis and resection are essential, due to their tendency to become impacted and obstruct the airway. The case is presented of a 56-year-old man who died suddenly of asphyxia because of upper airway obstruction by a prolapsed fibrolipoma of the esophagus. 
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with meningitis. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with meningitis was measured by our modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for G-CSF. The minimal detection level was 20 pg/mL G-CSF. In patients with bacterial meningitis, the G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were extremely elevated, showing a mean value of approximately 1,500 pg/mL. On the other hand, G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid from 67% patients with aseptic meningitis were moderately increased, showing a mean value of about 80 pg/mL, whereas G-CSF levels in 33% samples remained undetectable. The G-CSF levels and neutrophil counts in the cerebrospinal fluid were proven to be related by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis (r = .724). These elevations of G-CSF levels at inflammation sites associated with bacterial meningitis may indicate that G-CSF plays an important role in the combat of bacterial infections. 
Choosing initial therapy for hypertension. A personal view. With numerous safe and effective antihypertensive drugs now available, the clinician should no longer choose only diuretic agents or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) as initial therapy. Five classes of agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium entry blockers, peripheral alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretic agents, are all appropriate monotherapy in properly selected patients. The choice depends on efficacy, side effects, demography, comorbidity, dosage schedule, cost, mechanism of drug action, and the pathophysiology of the patient's hypertension. Extensive data are now available that will assist the clinician in choosing an agent that has the greatest probability of success without the need for extensive biochemical or hemodynamic evaluation. 
Variations in acromial ossification simulating infant abuse in victims of sudden infant death syndrome. A variation in ossification of the acromial process of the scapula is described. Postmortem radiographs, obtained in 78 infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome, showed an ossific opacity adjacent to the acromial process in 10 infants (13%). This finding was noted bilaterally in six patients and unilaterally in four patients. No two ossicles were identical. Histologically, no growth plate cartilage was evident between the bony structure and the acromion proper; therefore, this appeared to represent a "pseudoepiphysis." Superficially, this normal variation may appear similar to an acromial fracture resulting from infant abuse. However, a careful analysis of the findings of this normal variation should help prevent any confusion with inflicted injury. 
Risk factors for pancreatic cellular injury after cardiopulmonary bypass BACKGROUND. Pancreatitis is a known complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Although ischemia is believed to be a factor, the cause of pancreatitis after cardiopulmonary bypass remains unknown. METHODS. We prospectively studied 300 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and serum lipase were measured on postoperative days 1,2,3,7, and 10. Pancreatic cellular injury was defined as the presence of hyperamylasemia (greater than 123 U per liter) with an increase in either the serum level of lipase (greater than 24 U per liter) or the peak level of pancreatic isoamylase. Trypsinogen-activation peptides, which indicate intrapancreatic enzyme activation, were measured in the urine of the last 101 patients studied. RESULTS. Evidence of pancreatic cellular injury was detected in 80 patients (27 percent), of whom 23 had associated abdominal signs or symptoms and 3 had severe pancreatitis (2 with pancreatic abscess and 1 with necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis). Two of 19 postoperative deaths were secondary to pancreatitis. In multivariate analyses, the development of pancreatic cellular injury was significantly associated with preoperative renal insufficiency, valve surgery, postoperative hypotension, and perioperative administration of calcium chloride. The administration of more than 800 mg of calcium chloride per square meter of body-surface area was an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury, and the increase in risk was dose-related. No differences were found in the level of trypsinogen-activation peptides between patients who had pancreatic cellular injury and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS. Pancreatic cellular injury, as indicated by hyperamylasemia of pancreatic origin, is common after cardiac surgery. The administration of large doses of calcium chloride is an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury and may be a cause of it. 
Results of treatment and lessons learned from pathologically staged T4 non-small cell lung cancer. Depending on the local extension of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invaded T4 structure(s), 49 patients underwent complete (CR, n = 14) or palliative (PR, n = 13) resection of exploratory thoracotomy (ET, n = 22) between January 1982 and June 1988. Thoracic radiotherapy (TR) was given to all patients receiving PR (median dose, 43 Gy) and ET (median dose, 53 Gy). With a median follow-up of 44 months, overall 2- and 5-year survival was 25 and 5%, respectively. Patients undergoing ET plus TR had a significantly worse survival than those treated by CR (P = 0.041) and PR plus TR (P = 0.046). Only completely resected patients became long-term survivors (5-year survival, 29%) and significant predictors of their survival were previous weight loss, hemoglobin, and creatinine level, in univariate analysis, and previous weight loss in multivariate analysis. The site of initial treatment failure was mainly local for PR plus TR (85%) and systemic for CR (71%) and ET plus TR (86%). Presented results suggest that surgery might play a role for selected patients with T4 NSCLC, but advances in systemic and local therapy are necessary. 
Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route? Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar. 
Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 2: Preliminary clinical experience. Fifteen patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated using electrolytically detachable coils introduced via an endovascular approach. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 69 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was subarachnoid hemorrhage (eight cases). Considerable thrombosis of the aneurysm (70% to 100%) was achieved in all 15 patients, and preservation of the parent artery was obtained in 14. Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths. It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms. It may also play an important role in the occlusion of aneurysms in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Cardiovascular risk factors in young snuff-users and cigarette smokers. We studied cardiovascular risk factors in 21 young men who were habitual snuff-users, and compared them with the same risk factors in 18 non-tobacco-users and 19 cigarette smokers of the same age and body mass index. Both snuff-users and smokers showed increased levels of alcohol and coffee consumption and a decreased level of physical exercise compared to non-users. Both groups of tobacco-users showed increased serum insulin levels compared to the control group at similar blood glucose concentrations. In contrast to the smokers, snuff-users showed no significant elevation of diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin concentrations, white cell count, serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Snuff users had higher plasma fibrinogen levels than non-users (P = 0.07). The use of snuff by young men appears to have less impact than smoking on cardiovascular risk factors, with the possible exception of elevated serum insulin and plasma fibrinogen levels. 
Cold cerebroplegia. A new technique of cerebral protection during operations on the transverse aortic arch. Profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest is the commonest method of cerebral protection during operations on the aortic arch. This technique allows a limited time to perform the aortic repair, however. It also necessitates prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass to rewarm the patient. This may be the cause of coagulation disorders or infection. Selective perfusion of the carotid arteries can also be used. When the perfusion is derived from the main arterial line, however, the repair of the aorta requires that the vessel be crossclamped, and cannot be performed in an "open, bloodless" manner. To avoid the disadvantages of both techniques, we have developed a new technique of cerebral protection. After a regular cardiopulmonary bypass has been established, the carotid arteries are cannulated and perfused with blood cooled at 6 degrees to 12 degrees C, through a separate heat exchanger, while the core temperature is maintained at moderate hypothermia (25 degrees to 28 degrees C, rectal). To perform the "open" distal repair, the cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued while the carotid perfusion is maintained (250 to 350 ml/min). When the distal repair is completed, cardiopulmonary bypass is resumed and the carotid perfusion is discontinued. Between 1984 and June 1989, 54 patients (mean age 55 years) were operated on with this method (45 elective operations, 9 emergency procedures). Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 121 minutes (65 to 248), and mean duration of circulatory arrest was 22 minutes (10 to 51). The electroencephalogram, routinely recorded, showed return of the cerebral activity after a mean time of 12 minutes and normal activity after a mean time of 66 minutes. There was no intraoperative death. Hospital mortality rate was 13% (7/54). One death was related to neurologic disorders. All patients but one awakened normally within 8 hours after operation. Two patients (4.3%) experienced a transient neurologic episode (lateral hemianopia) 9 and 11 days postoperatively. There was no hemorrhagic complication (24-hour average blood loss: 840 +/- 540 ml). In our experience the technique of "cold cerebroplegia" has been demonstrated to provide excellent cerebral protection. It requires no prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and does not limit the time necessary to perform the aortic repair. It may be considered as a safe alternative to profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest. 
The long QT syndrome. Prospective longitudinal study of 328 families. BACKGROUND. The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is an infrequently occurring familial disorder in which affected individuals have electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation and a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmic syncope and sudden death. We prospectively investigated the clinical characteristics and the long-term course of 3,343 individuals from 328 families in which one or more members were identified as affected with LQTS (QTc greater than 0.44 sec1/2). METHODS AND RESULTS. The first member of a family to be identified with LQTS, the proband, was usually brought to medical attention because of a syncopal episode during childhood or teenage years. Probands (n = 328) were younger at first contact (age 21 +/- 15 years), more likely to be female (69%), and had a higher frequency of preenrollment syncope or cardiac arrest with resuscitation (80%), congenital deafness (7%), a resting heart rate less than 60 beats/min (31%), QTc greater than or equal to 0.50 sec1/2 (52%), and a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (47%) than other affected (n = 688) and unaffected (n = 1,004) family members. Arrhythmogenic syncope often occurred in association with acute physical, emotional, or auditory arousal. The syncopal episodes were frequently misinterpreted as a seizure disorder. By age 12 years, 50% of the probands had experienced at least one syncopal episode or death. The rates of postenrollment syncope (one or more episodes) and probable LQTS-related death (before age 50 years) for probands (n = 235; average follow-up 54 months per patient) were 5.0% per year and 0.9% per year, respectively; these event rates were considerably higher than those observed among affected and unaffected family members. CONCLUSIONS. Among 232 probands and 1,264 family members with prospective follow-up, three factors made significant independent contributions to the risk of subsequent syncope or probable LQTS-related death before age 50 years, whichever occurred first (Cox hazard ratio; 95% confidence limits): 1) QTc (1.052; 1.017, 1.088), 2) history of cardiac event (3.1; 1.3, 7.2), and 3) heart rate (1.017; 1.004, 1.031). The findings from this prospective longitudinal study highlight the clinical features, risk factors, and course of LQTS. 
Relationship between foot transcutaneous oxygen tension and ankle systolic blood pressure at rest and following exercise. To determine whether foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) and ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) measure similar aspects of peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD), the authors examined their relationship at rest and following treadmill exercise. Thirty-seven PVOD patients (mean age 69.2 +/- 0.8 years) rested supine for twenty minutes, followed by a progressive treadmill walking test at a constant speed of 2 mph. The initial grade was 0%; this increased 2% every two minutes until maximal claudication pain (n = 19) or until the occurrence of such limiting symptoms as volitional fatigue (n = 6), ST segment depression (n = 4), dyspnea (n = 3), multiple premature ventricular contractions (n = 2), and angina (n = 2). Patients then rested supine for fifteen minutes. Foot TcPO2 was recorded before, during, and after exercise, whereas ankle SBP was measured before and after exercise. At rest, a curvilinear relationship was found between foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP (foot TcPO2 = 41.89 + 0.22(ankle SBP) + 0.0005 (ankle SBP2); SEE = 9.2, R = 0.64, R2 = 0.41, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the relationship was stronger and more linear during recovery, particularly at the sixth minute (foot TcPO2) = 8.33 + 0.35 (ankle SBP); SEE = 13.6, R = 0.86, R2 = 0.73, p less than 0.001). At rest, foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP characterized different aspects of PVOD because they shared only 41% common variance. During recovery, they provided similar information because up to 73% of the variance was shared. It is concluded that foot TcPO2 should also be used to assess PVOD patients because unique information is obtained at rest and values can be recorded during exercise. 
Long-term effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension. Various nonpharmacological therapies reduce the blood pressure of a significant portion of both patients with established hypertension and people who are considered to be at high risk for the development of hypertension; that is, they are secondary and primary preventions. Of the various therapies, weight reduction, sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol intake, and regular aerobic exercise have been shown to be most effective, whereas the effectiveness of other practices has been less uniform or smaller in degree. Changes in lifestyle, mainly involving diet and physical activity, should be widely used to treat and, hopefully, to prevent hypertension. 
Nonspecific findings on MR imaging. The importance of correlative studies and clinical information. Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system, changes in marrow and soft-tissue signal intensity are often nonspecific, and benign conditions may be mistaken for malignancy. In an effort to identify the cause of this type of misdiagnosis in MR examinations, the MR scans were reviewed of 30 patients whose images manifested bone and/or soft-tissue changes that were initially believed to be consistent with malignancy but were later found to represent benign conditions. Of the 30 patients, MR abnormalities were attributable to trauma in 11, benign tumors and tumorlike conditions in ten, infection in seven, and prior radiotherapy in two. In 24 cases, correlative imaging studies (14 patients), appropriate clinical history (six patients), and/or physical and laboratory examinations (four patients) would have avoided these misdiagnoses. 
Ureteral catheter tip separation: potential risk using the open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter. Ureteral catheters are a vital part of the urological armamentarium. We report 2 cases in which the flexible tip portion of an open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter became disjointed from the shaft within the renal collecting system during endourological procedures. The etiology, prevention and management of this complication are discussed. 
The effect of quadriceps excision on functional results after distal femoral resection and prosthetic replacement of bone tumors. Although resection and reconstruction with a prosthesis is an accepted form of treatment for tumors of the distal femur, minimal effort has been made to correlate the functional result with the degree of adjacent muscle excision. From 1983 to 1986, 65 patients had distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction. Ten patients had only the vastus intermedius excised (Group A), 30 patients had excision of the vastus intermedius plus either the vastus medialis or lateralis (Group B), nine patients had only the rectus femoris spared (Group C), and 16 patients had the entire quadriceps excised or conversion of the previous arthrodesis (Group D). Based on the rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, satisfactory results were obtained in 70% of Group A patients (30% excellent and 40% good), with no poor results. In group B, 80% had good or excellent results and 7% poor results. In Group C, 78% of the patients had good results but no excellent results, whereas Group D had only 50% satisfactory results. The parameters that most often led to functional impairment were restricted motion and inadequate extensor powers. Muscle transfers, however, (flexors to extensors) were effective only in Group C patients. With proper technique and prosthetic design, satisfactory results can be achieved after distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction, even after extensive quadriceps excision. 
Surgical repair of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease: transvaginal approach. The surgical management of rectovaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease has been associated with unacceptably high failure rates. We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem. Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula. A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months). Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair. One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure. We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa. On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease. 
Malignant neoplasia of the paranasal sinuses associated with mucocele. Paranasal sinus mucoceles are histologically benign and typically cause ophthalmic morbidity only after significant orbital extension. The authors describe seven patients who had both a mucocele and a malignant tumor in the same paranasal sinus and in whom the neoplasm was discovered incidentally during operation for mucocele. Although malignancy coexistent with paranasal sinus mucocele is uncommon, the association should be considered and appropriate biopsy specimens obtained if operation for mucocele is required. 
Detection of micrometastatic tumor cells in bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients. To determine the incidence and clinical significance of micrometastases in the bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients, we performed an immunoalkaline phosphatase assay using anticytokeratin (AE1, AE3, MAK-6) and antiepithelial (113F1, 260F9, 317G5) antibodies on the bone marrow aspirates of 71 stage IV disease patients with either recurrent regional or distant metastases. Although we detected tumor cells within the bone marrow of 38% of these patients with this assay, no significant correlation was seen with patient's age, menopausal status, bone scan, bone marrow core histology, response to induction chemotherapy, number of metastatic sites, dominant site of metastasis, or subsequent clinical outcome. The clinical parameters that were associated with improved survival were one dominant site of metastatic disease and regional soft tissue recurrence without distant disease. 
Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound in the evaluation of pericardial disease. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium. Cardiac tamponade results in right atrial collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse detectable by echocardiography. These echocardiographic signs have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. False-negative echocardiographic studies may be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and false-positive studies for cardiac tamponade may occur in severe hypovolemia. Although cardiac tamponade is usually caused by pericardial effusion, less commonly intrapericardial clot may result in hemodynamic compromise. Pericardial clot may be echogenic, and hence the diagnosis potentially can be missed. If the intrapericardial clot is localized, the classic echocardiographic signs of pericardial effusion may be absent, and a localized mass may be seen on the echocardiogram. Increased respiratory variation in transvalvular blood flow velocities detectable by Doppler ultrasound is found in cardiac tamponade. Doppler ultrasound studies may be particularly useful in those patients in whom the characteristic echocardiographic abnormalities are absent. Both M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography may be useful in diagnosing pericardial thickening. Constrictive pericarditis results in a variety of echocardiographic abnormalities including pericardial thickening; biatrial enlargement with good left ventricular function; a diastolic septal bounce; and a dilated inferior vena cava without significant respiratory variation. Doppler echocardiographic abnormalities are commonly found in constrictive pericarditis. Echocardiography is also useful as a guide to performing pericardiocentesis and in the detection of pericardial adhesions and pericardial metastases. 
Pericardial actinomycosis: case report and review. Pericardial actinomycosis is rare and frequently goes unrecognized during life, a circumstance due in part to a paucity of clinical manifestations and to a low rate of positivity in cultures. We present a case report of pericardial actinomycosis and a review of 18 other cases reported in the literature since 1950. Possible risk factors include aspiration pneumonia, alcohol abuse, and periodontal disease. Actinomyces may cause purulent pericarditis that evolves into cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Clues to the identity of the causative organism (e.g., draining sinus tracts and the presence of sulfur granules) are frequently absent, and cultures often fail to yield the organism. Histologic examination of material obtained by biopsy is often necessary to make the diagnosis. Most cases originate from a thoracopulmonary site of actinomycosis and spread directly to the pericardium. Widespread dissemination to extrathoracic organs is uncommon. Treatment consists of high-dose, long-term antimicrobial therapy as well as drainage of the pericardial space. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years. The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression. 
Erythropoietin deficiency after coronary artery bypass procedures. Erythropoietin is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Erythropoietin has been shown to increase exponentially in response to linear decreases in hematocrit in normal, unstressed animals. However, the effect of operation, with its attendant stress, on erythropoietin levels is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of surgical stress on erythropoietin. Twenty otherwise healthy patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures were studied. The cholecystectomy group included 10 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for documented stone disease. Ten patients who underwent coronary artery bypass procedures constituted the coronary artery bypass grafting group. Patients were studied preoperatively as well as on the first and second postoperative days. The hematocrit and erythropoietin levels were similar in both groups preoperatively. The hematocrit in the coronary artery bypass grafting group was lower than that of the cholecystectomy group on postoperative day 1 (0.31 versus 0.36; p less than 0.003) and postoperative day 2 (0.30 versus 0.36; p less than 0.001). During the first two postoperative days the erythropoietin levels were similar between groups. The data show that postoperative erythropoietin levels are similar after coronary artery bypass grafting, despite more severe anemia, when compared with cholecystectomy. This suggests that after coronary artery bypass grafting there is a relative deficiency of erythropoietin. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients undergoing surgical procedures could correct the erythropoietin deficiency and accelerate postoperative erythropoiesis. 
Ruling out acute myocardial infarction. A prospective multicenter validation of a 12-hour strategy for patients at low risk BACKGROUND. Although previous investigations have suggested that 24 hours is required to exclude acute myocardial infarction in patients who are admitted to a coronary care unit for the evaluation of acute chest pain, we hypothesized that a 12-hour period might be adequate for patients with a low probability of infarction at the time of admission. METHODS. Using a Bayesian model, we developed a strategy to identify candidates for a shorter period of observation from an analysis of a derivation set of 976 patients with acute chest pain who were admitted to three teaching and four community hospitals. In the derivation set, patients whose clinical characteristics in the emergency room predicted a low (less than or equal to 7 percent) probability of myocardial infarction had only a 0.4 percent risk of infarction if they had neither abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes nor recurrent ischemic pain during the first 12 hours of hospitalization. In an independent testing set of 2684 patients from the seven hospitals, 957 admitted patients (36 percent) were classified as candidates for this 12-hour period of observation according to a previously published multivariate algorithm. Few of these patients were actually transferred from a monitored setting at 12 hours. RESULTS. Of the 771 candidates for a 12-hour period of observation who did not have enzyme abnormalities or recurrent pain during the first 12 hours, 4 (0.5 percent) were subsequently found to have acute myocardial infarction, and only 3 (0.4 percent) died after primary cardiac arrests, all of which occurred three to five days after admission. Rates of other major cardiovascular complications were low in the patients who might have been transferred from the coronary care unit after 12 hours with this strategy. In patients with a higher initial risk of infarction, the standard strategy of 24-hour observation identified all but 11 of 739 acute myocardial infarctions (1 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Emergency room clinical data can be used to identify a large subgroup of patients for whom a 12-hour period of observation is normally sufficient to exclude acute myocardial infarction. Patient-specific evaluation and treatment can then proceed without the restrictions imposed by "rule-out" protocols for myocardial infarction. 
Cholesterol screening management of Florida's pediatric population. The current cholesterol screening and management of Florida's pediatric population is evaluated utilizing a questionnaire mailed to 1,534 pediatric health care providers. Twenty percent of the physicians responded. Of the respondents, 65% do not routinely screen for the presence of hypercholesterolemia. Only 28% of the respondents obtain serum total cholesterol measurements in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition recommendations. The serum total cholesterol concentration prompting treatment was 240 mg/dL (6.2 mM). Dietary counseling alone, or in combination with exercise, was the initial treatment approach recommended by 98% of the responding physicians. Dietary education for the hypercholesterolemic patient was provided by both dieticians (46%) and physicians (42%). If the initial dietary intervention was unsuccessful, 48% of the physicians would begin medical therapy. The most commonly prescribed medication was a bile acid sequestrant (70%), with the majority (52%) referring their patient to a subspecialist for evaluation and care. 
Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser for port-wine stains in infancy: earlier versus later treatment. Twelve children, 6 to 30 weeks of age (average 14.9 weeks), with port-wine stains of the head and neck were treated with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 585 nm and 450 microsecond pulse duration. Ten of 12 patients (83%) showed more than 50% lightening of their port-wine stains after 2.9 treatment sessions (2.9 +/- 1.4 [+/- standard deviation]). Forty-five percent of the patients demonstrated 75% or more lightening of their lesions after a mean of 3.8 treatments (+/- 1.6). No lesions in this group cleared completely after a mean of 2.8 treatments. Treated skin was identical in texture to normal skin in all patients. There was no evidence of depressed scars, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, or hypopigmentation in the treated areas. These results indicate that pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains can be undertaken safely in infancy. 
Diffuse melanosis in metastatic malignant melanoma. The skin of a patient with diffuse melanosis as a result of malignant melanoma was examined by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Our findings indicate that the slate-blue discoloration in this patient was due to pigment deposition in dermal macrophages and endothelial cells. Multiple attempts to identify disseminated metastatic melanoma cells were unsuccessful. 
Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for primary locally advanced rectal and rectosigmoid carcinoma. To improve local control and survival in patients with primary locally advanced rectal and rectosigmoid carcinoma, intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) has been used with a combination of moderate- to high-dose preoperative radiation therapy and surgical resection. Sixty-five patients underwent resection with the intention of using IORT if areas at high risk for local recurrence were apparent at surgery. For 20 patients undergoing complete resection with IORT, the 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival (DFS) was 88% and 53%, respectively. The results for 22 patients with pathologically documented residual carcinoma were less satisfactory with a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 60% and 32%, respectively. In this latter group, local control and DFS correlated with the extent of residual disease: patients with only microscopic disease had a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 69% and 47%, respectively, whereas for patients with macroscopic disease, these figures were 50% and 17%, respectively. For 18 patients undergoing complete resection without IORT or additional postoperative radiation therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control and DFS was 67% and 53%, respectively. Because local failure will occur in at least 30% of patients undergoing partial resection with or without IORT as well as patients undergoing complete resection of advanced tumors without IORT, additional postoperative radiation therapy should be considered. 
Parameters for and safety of contact Nd:YAG laser irradiation of early gastric cancer: an in vitro study. Early gastric cancers have been treated by endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser irradiation. The extent of thermal damage produced by this laser system has been inadequately investigated. In an in vitro study we have shown that contact laser probes produce consistent and reproducible thermal lesions in the human stomach wall. Contact laser energies of 40 to 60 joules are optimal for the ablation of early gastric cancer. Energies greater than 90 joules are associated with a high incidence of gastric perforation. Contact laser probes may have advantages over non-contact laser techniques for the endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer in patients who are unfit for major surgery. 
Toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for advanced hematologic malignancies is associated with high relapse rates. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 "induction" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 "maintenance" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated "induction" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed "maintenance." Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies. 
The pathogenesis of hypertension: black-white differences. In summary, for reasons that are not clear, some persons seem to be extremely good at retaining sodium on a high-sodium diet or poor at excreting sodium on a high-sodium intake. This is more frequent in Western hemisphere blacks than in whites in the West or in blacks in Africa. These geographic/ethnic differences in sodium handling ability may be related to environmental factors or, more likely, to inherited differences in the ability to conserve sodium based on the evolutionary principle of survival fo the fittest for the ability to conserve sodium. The frequency of this salt-conserving (thrifty) genotype in Western hemisphere blacks may have been further increased as a consequence of severe selection pressures for survival based on the ability to conserve sodium during the slavery period of history in the West. One characteristic of the blood pressure control systems of Western hemisphere blacks is suppression of plasma renin activity without suppression of aldosterone production. In addition there is greater nephrosclerosis in blacks than whites and a more rapid decline in creatinine clearance with age. When more sodium is ingested than the kidneys are able to handle (excrete), there is a (transient) slight positive sodium balance; as a result sodium, chloride, and water are retained, resulting in an expansion of plasma volume (Fig. 7-3). The initial physiologic responses include (increased) secretion of atrial natriuretic peptides and the digitalis-like substance (natriuretic hormone), and inhibition of vasopressin and aldosterone secretion. The net effect is directly enhanced natriuresis and diuresis, and a reduction in plasma volume, with no significant effect on blood pressure. However, if there is a continuing tendency to sodium retention and volume expansion, the capacity of the aforementioned mechanisms to control plasma volume will be exceeded; then, the chronically elevated level of the digitalis-like substance will inhibit the sodium pumps in the arterial and venous smooth muscle cells and in the sympathetic neurons. The increased venous tone will help to reduce plasma volume directly by reducing central venous volume. Arterial tone will be increased by direct action of the digitalis-like substance on the arterial smooth muscle and, indirectly, via the hormone's action on the sympathetic neurons. Initially, of course, blood pressure will be maintained in the normal range (but will be labile) because of the compensating cardiovascular reflexes. Once the capacity of these reflexes to control blood pressure is exceeded, however, the blood pressure will begin to rise; this will induce a pressure natriuresis to help restore plasma volume to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Complications of transurethral electro-incision of posterior urethral valves. The development of dense urethral strictures following transurethral resection of posterior urethral valves is a well known complication, especially in the neonate. In 85 boys with posterior urethral valves no strictures were found during follow-up. Urinary incontinence associated with transurethral incision occurred in 3 patients and a small urethral diverticulum was found in 1. The complication rate associated with the transurethral incision itself was 5%. Our technique for transurethral incision of posterior urethral valves is described. 
Intraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied. After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function. 
Is adjuvant chemotherapy necessary for patients with stage B1 testicular cancer? Controversy exists concerning the role of adjunctive chemotherapy in patients with regional nodal involvement. A randomized study reported a 48% relapse rate for patients with positive nodes (stage B1 or stage B2), all of whom were salvaged by full-dose platinum-based chemotherapy. In a series of patients with positive nodes who received two cycles of adjunctive chemotherapy postoperatively, the relapse rate was only 2%. In order to evaluate the effect of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection on relapse rates in patients with stage B1 testicular cancer, a retrospective review of a series of 39 patients was performed. Criteria for inclusion included pathologic stage B1 (less than six positive nodes, located in the primary landing site, with no node greater than 2 cm in diameter and no extracapsular lymph node extension). Patients who fulfilled the criteria along with normalization of tumor markers were followed-up expectantly after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Thirty-nine patients were followed from 1 to 10 years with the median duration of follow-up of 3.5 years. Ten of the 39 patients had modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissections with preservation of antegrade ejaculation. The other 29 had full retroperitoneal lymph node dissections. Three relapses were seen, one patient with retrocrural and pulmonary metastases and two patients with pulmonary metastases only for a relapse rate of 8% (three of 39). Patients with stage B2 disease received adjunctive chemotherapy with two or three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. We conclude that retroperitoneal lymph node dissection alone is adequate treatment for the majority of patients with pathologic stage B1 testicular cancer. In that subset of patients, adjunctive chemotherapy should be reserved for relapse. 
Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Let sleeping dogs lie: role of the omentum in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. A surgical aphorism has long held that the omentum is the "watchdog of the abdomen." However, detractors believe that leaving the omentum behind after colectomy precipitates later small bowel obstruction. A retrospective comparison was made between a group of 406 patients (Group I) having omentectomy with proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis and a group of 239 patients (Group II) having a similar procedure without omentectomy. Follow-up in this series of 645 patients was 4.3 +/- 2.1 years (mean +/- SEM). No difference was present in the rate of partial small bowel obstruction or complete small bowel obstruction between Group I patients (32 percent partial, 12 percent complete) and Group II patients (29 percent partial, 12 percent complete; P greater than 0.1). However, a better outcome with regard to postoperative sepsis and sepsis requiring operation was apparent in Group II patients retaining the omentum (4 percent and 3 percent, respectively) than in Group I patients (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively), in whom the omentum was removed (P less than 0.01). As this experience would support, we urge surgeons to "let sleeping dogs lie" and, when possible, retain the omentum when performing colectomy or proctocolectomy. 
Cancer incidence following subtotal gastrectomy. Hawaiian Japanese men (n = 432) who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy for peptic ulcers before 1971-1975 were followed up for detection of cancer development. They showed a significant increase in colon cancer risk (P = 0.008) and lung cancer risk (P = 0.002) compared with 6161 nongastrectomized men. The association with lung cancer persisted after adjustment for cigarette use (P = 0.03). Alcohol consumption was associated with colonic cancer in this cohort, and gastrectomized men consumed more alcohol than nongastrectomized men; however, the association of gastrectomy with colon cancer persisted after adjustment for alcohol use (P = 0.02). Gastrectomized men were lighter and had lower serum lipid levels than controls, suggesting that undernutrition might favor the development of some cancers. The type of gastroenteric anastomosis did not influence the cancer risk level in the colon or lung. 
Reasons for the lack of benefit of immediate angioplasty during recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a regional wall motion analysis. European Cooperative Study Group. Regional ventricular wall motion analysis utilizing three different methods was performed on predischarge left ventriculograms from 291 of 367 patients enrolled in a randomized trial of single chain recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), aspirin and heparin with and without immediate angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction. With univariate analysis, no difference in regional wall motion variables between the two treatment groups was observed. However, with individual baseline risk assessment by multivariate linear regression analysis using baseline characteristics known to be related to left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy or outcome of coronary angioplasty, or both, an excess of high risk patients in the invasive treatment group was detected. To adjust for this unequal distribution of baseline risk, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed. No benefit of immediate coronary angioplasty was observed after adjustment. Reocclusion or reinfarction, or both, occurred more frequently in the invasive than in the noninvasive treatment group (18% versus 13%, respectively). Among patients with a patent infarct-related vessel on angiography between days 10 and 22 and without reinfarction before angiography, there was a trend toward benefit from the invasive strategy, indicating that reocclusion and reinfarction might be responsible for the lack of benefit of the invasive strategy. This implies that immediate coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in selected patients, provided that these complications can be prevented. 
Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis of 77 patients. Although sonographically guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy has been attracting a great deal of attention in the treatment of liver neoplasms, few reports regarding long-term results of this therapy have been published. We report here our 4-year experience, in which ethanol injection was performed 419 times on 108 lesions in 77 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathologic examination performed in 14 cases after the therapy revealed that the lesion was completely necrotic in 10 cases, 90% necrotic in three cases, and 70% necrotic in the remaining case. Angiography performed after the therapy showed complete disappearance of tumor stain in 37 of 42 cases treated with ethanol injection. CT after the therapy showed no enhancement of the treated lesion in 55 of 56 cases. Elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein decreased in 21 of 24 cases. Ethanol injection improved the long-term prognosis of the patients. Among the 50 patients in whom there were three or fewer lesions and all lesions were treated by ethanol injection, the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were 89%, 74%, 68%, and 60%, respectively. Factors that significantly affected the prognosis were the goal of the treatment, liver function, and size of the largest lesion. Serious complications rarely occurred even in patients with severe liver dysfunction. Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy appears to be valuable for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Effect of increasing degrees of ischemic injury on myocardial oxidative metabolism early after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts. The present investigation studied the effect of increasing severities of ischemic injury on recovery of oxidative metabolism after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts perfused retrogradely with erythrocyte-containing medium. Hearts subjected to 60 minutes of low-flow ischemia (5% of control perfusion) exhibited delayed but sustained recovery of left ventricular pressure development during reperfusion and preservation of ultrastructure delineated with electron microscopy. Immediately after reperfusion, myocardial oxygen consumption returned to control values, well before left ventricular pressure development recovered. Early after reperfusion release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]palmitate was reduced (-53%, p less than 0.01). Conversely, release of 14CO2 from [U-14C]glucose was increased (+131%, p less than 0.05). After 60 minutes of reperfusion 14CO2 release had completely returned to normal for both labeled substrates. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that during transient depression of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation more tracer was incorporated into myocardial lipid esters, primarily triglycerides. In contrast to hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia, hearts subjected to 60 minutes of no-flow ischemia exhibited poor recovery of contractile function during the reperfusion period. Electron microscopic examination of reperfused hearts showed advanced myocyte damage consistent with irreversible injury. Interestingly, myocardial oxygen consumption in this group also recovered to control values. The substrate pattern during the early reperfusion period was similar to that of hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia. After 120 minutes of no-flow ischemia, recovery of oxidative metabolism was virtually absent. The results indicate a pronounced dissociation between recovery of oxidative metabolism and of contractile function in reperfused myocardium. The oxidative metabolic rate was disproportionately high compared with contractile function, not only in reversibly "stunned" hearts, but also in severely damaged hearts exhibiting signs of irreversible injury. 
Pituitary adenomas: automatic static perimetry and Goldmann perimetry. A comparative study of 345 visual field charts. In a series of 81 cases of pituitary adenoma 345 charts of visual field performed with static automatic perimetry (AP) on the Vision Monitor and Goldmann perimetry (GP) were compared. Generally both methods were equivalent in the detection of chiasmal compression. The charts were divided into two groups: (A) 208 charts and (B) 137 charts according to the number of isoptres investigated: two (V4, 112) or three (V4, 112, 12). In group A the AP was more often altered than the GP, and the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In group B the GP seemed more effective, but the number of questionable cases was greater and the difference was not statistically significant. When the most internal isoptre of GP was outside the central 30 degrees, AP was more often abnormal (29%) than GP (2.2%), and the difference was statistically significant (chi 2, p less than 0.001). Within the central 30 degrees the GP seemed more often to be altered (23% of cases) than the AP (19.4%), but one-third of the cases were questionable. Within the central 30 degrees both techniques gave identical results and there was no statistically significant difference. The discrepancies between both static and kinetic techniques are an argument for their complementary use. 
Primary soft tissue tumours of the pelvis causing referred pain in the leg. Referred pain in the leg is occasionally due to a pelvic soft tissue tumour. Among 11 patients who presented this way, one had a lymphoma, one had a benign schwannoma, and nine had soft tissue sarcomas. Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg. 
Urothelial leiomyomatous hamartoma of the kidney. A 34-year-old woman presented with a renal pelvic mass. A nephroureterectomy including a cuff of bladder, was performed and pathologic examination revealed a hamartoma involving the renal parenchyma and pelvis. The pelvic portion of the tumor was composed of papillae lined by urothelium; the parenchymal portion of the tumor was composed of tubules within a fibromuscular stroma. The authors propose that this is a distinct entity not previously described in the literature. 
Restoration of Na(+)-K+ pump activity and resting membrane potential by myo-inositol supplementation in neuroblastoma cells chronically exposed to glucose or galactose. myo-Inositol uptake by culture neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of myo-inositol less than 50 microM was largely Na+ dependent. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to media supplemented with increasing concentrations of myo-inositol resulted in an increase in myo-inositol accumulation and intracellular content, but myo-inositol incorporation into phospholipids was not increased. The data indicate that myo-inositol exists as separate pools in neuroblastoma cells, and one or more of these pools may contribute to phospholipid synthesis. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to an increased concentration of glucose caused a decrease in myo-inositol uptake by two separate mechanisms. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM glucose caused a myo-inositol concentration-dependent decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake. We propose that the acute inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by glucose is likely due to a competitive type of inhibition. Chronic exposure of cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose also caused decreases in myo-inositol uptake and incorporation into inositol phospholipids and intracellular myo-inositol content. This decrease in myo-inositol metabolism persisted at a higher concentration of external myo-inositol than the acute inhibition. Supplementing media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose with 250 microM myo-inositol restored myo-inositol metabolism and content. The inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by cells chronically exposed to increased concentrations of glucose or galactose was due to a noncompetitive type of inhibition that was blocked by the addition of sorbinil. Chronic exposure of neuroblastoma cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose caused a decrease in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase transport activity and resting membrane potential. 
Maternal and fetal haemodynamics in hypertensive pregnancies during maternal treatment with intravenous hydralazine or labetalol. Intravenous treatment with 10 mg of hydralazine or 100 mg of labetalol was randomly allocated to 30 hypertensive pregnant women. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were recorded using a pulsed Doppler duplex scanner (ATL Mk V) and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were derived from these recordings. Maternal blood pressure decreased significantly after both drugs. Maternal pulse rate increased after hydralazine but did not change significantly after labetalol. FHR did not change significantly after hydralazine but decreased after labetalol. PI decreased after hydralazine and increased after labetalol--most fetuses showed little change but a few in each group showed large changes in PI, as did two of five additional patients studied. We attributed the decrease in PI in some fetuses after hydralazine to vasodilation, and the increase in PI in some fetuses after labetalol to vasoconstriction in the fetoplacental circulation, suggesting that fetal beta-blockade may occur after maternal treatment with labetalol. 
Selective effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on neuropeptide and guanine nucleotide stimulated phospholipase C activity in intact N1E-115 neuroblastoma. The influence of acute and chronic ethanol exposures on the coupling of neurotensin and bradykinin receptors to phospholipase C was determined in intact N1E-115 cells. Phospholipase C was monitored by the formation of total [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium in cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Acute exposure to ethanol over a range of 50 to 200 mM inhibited the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation elicited by neurotensin and bradykinin. In cells chronically exposed to 100 mM ethanol for 7 days, neither basal- nor neurotensin-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate formation differed significantly from those of control (untreated) cells. In contrast, the [3H]inositol response to bradykinin was significantly inhibited in cells chronically exposed to ethanol. Because chronic ethanol exposure had no parallel effects on either the specific binding of [3H]bradykinin or the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation by the stable GTP analog, guanine 5'-(y-thiotriphosphate), it is suggested that chronic ethanol impairs the ability of bradykinin receptors to activate the guanine nucleotide binding protein associated with phospholipase C. In addition, because chronic ethanol had no effect on the inositol phosphate response to neurotensin, it is proposed that certain types of receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein interactions are more vulnerable than are others to disruption by chronic ethanol treatment. 
Identification of nuclear tau isoforms in human neuroblastoma cells. The tau proteins have been reported only in association with microtubules and with ribosomes in situ, in the normal central nervous system. In addition, tau has been shown to be an integral component of paired helical filaments, the principal constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles found in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and of most aged individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). We report here the localization of the well-characterized Tau-1 monoclonal antibody to the nucleolar organizer regions of the acrocentric chromosomes and to their interphase counterpart, the fibrillar component of the nucleolus, in human neuroblastoma cells. Similar localization to the nucleolar organizer regions was also observed in other human cell lines and in one monkey kidney cell line but was not seen in non-primate species. Immunochemically, we further demonstrate the existence of the entire tau molecule in the isolated nuclei of neuroblastoma cells. Nuclear tau proteins, like the tau proteins of the paired helical filaments, cannot be extracted in standard SDS-containing electrophoresis sample buffer but require pretreatment with formic acid prior to immunoblot analysis. This work indicates that tau may function in processes not directly associated with microtubules and that highly insoluble complexes of tau may also play a role in normal cellular physiology. 
Differentiation between somatic and cognitive/affective components in commonly used measurements of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. Let's not mix apples and oranges. Patients with chronic low-back pain are frequently diagnosed as depressed. However, many of the neurovegetative signs of depression may also result from pain. The purpose of the present study was 1) to investigate the relationship between commonly used measurements of depression and pain perception; and 2) to examine the utility of differentiating between somatic signs and cognitive/affective symptoms of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression were divided into cognitive/affective and somatic subscales. These measures, as well as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, were administered to 111 patients with chronic low-back pain. Analyses revealed significant correlations between depression scores and self-reported pain intensity. The cognitive/affective subscale of the Beck Depression Inventory resulted in the only nonsignificant correlation with pain intensity. These findings suggest that commonly used measurements of depression are confounded with pain symptomatology and that the cognitive/affective category of the Beck Depression Inventory may prove to be a more accurate measurement of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. 
Patient dose and risk in mammography. Patient dose in mammography is estimated by two different methods which are compared and which give good agreement. A mean tissue dose of about 1 mGy per film is found for a breast of 4.5 cm compressed thickness. Variables which affect dose are then considered quantitatively, including compressed breast thickness, tube potential, grids, magnification and beam collimation. The variables having the greatest effect are breast thickness and magnification. For example, an 8 cm breast receives about four times the mean tissue dose of a 3.5 cm breast. Similarly, using a magnification factor of about 2, dose is increased about four times in the primary beam, but the adverse consequences may be largely removed with conventional collimation to part of the breast only. Finally, the dose estimates are combined with existing data on breast cancer induction to predict the risk of carcinogenesis in a breast screening programme. For example, in a screening centre performing 15,000 examinations per year, only one induced cancer is predicted in about 7 years of screening under average UK conditions of age and breast thickness. 
Coronary heart disease: black-white differences. Important features of the racial patterns in CHD at the present time are summarized in Table 15-10. Many of these conclusions follow inevitably from the economic disadvantage suffered by blacks, and the overwhelming importance of hypertension in this population. More knowledge is needed regarding the value of standard diagnostic tools in distinguishing noncoronary from coronary chest pain symptoms. A hard look is also needed at questions of access for blacks, particularly to angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy. There is additional growing evidence that the gains against CHD have been concentrated primarily among the educated and affluent. New strategies will need to be developed if we are to repeat the kind of gains against cardiovascular disease among blacks in the 1990s that were made in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Chylothorax after oesophagectomy. Chylothorax is an uncommon complication of oesophagectomy. In a review of 537 oesophageal resections there were 11 cases of chylothorax, an incidence of 2.0 per cent. There was no correlation with site, size, penetration, lymph node status, length or type of tumour but there was a significant correlation between chylothorax and the type of operative procedure carried out. The incidence in 95 transhiatal resections was 10.5 per cent. The incidence following 442 transthoracic procedures was 0.2 per cent (P less than 0.001) with one chylous fistula occurring after a three-stage oesophagectomy. Initial management was conservative with chest drainage and total parenteral nutrition. Thoracotomy and duct ligation was subsequently carried out in three patients and was successful in two. The third patient died. Conservative management alone was successful in four out of eight patients, with closure of the fistula at a median of 35 days (range 14-42 days). Four patients treated conservatively died. Transhiatal oesophagectomy greatly increases the risk of chylothorax, a condition that carries a high mortality rate (46 per cent in this series) whether managed conservatively or by surgical intervention. 
Establishment and characterization of a new human leukemia cell line derived from M4E0. A new human leukemia cell line, designated as ME-1, was established from the peripheral blood leukemia cells of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (M4E0). This cell line has the characteristic chromosome abnormality of M4E0, inv(16) (p13q22). When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, ME-1 cells were monoblastoid, but with the addition of cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, or medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral leukocytes (PHA-LCM), the cells exhibited differentiation to macrophage-like cells. PHA-LCM also promoted eosinophilic-lineage differentiation of this cell line, although IL-5 did not do so. To elucidate the mechanism of proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells, we studied the effect of a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), on colony formation of ME-1 cells. H-7 inhibited colony formation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF dose dependently, but had little inhibitory effect on colony formation by IL-4. These results indicate that the proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF were related to the activation of protein kinase C, while those by IL-4 involved other regulatory systems. ME-1 cells should be useful for studying the pathogenesis of M4E0 and the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of leukemic and normal progenitors by cytokines. 
Phosphate metabolites and steroid hormone receptors of benign and malignant breast tumors. A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance study. Phosphorous 31 (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded from perchloric acid extracts of benign and malignant breast tumors. The spectra were correlated with the histopathologic diagnosis and the steroid receptor status of the tumor. Higher relative content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphoethanolamine (GPE), the high-energy nucleoside phosphates (nucleoside-diphosphate [NDP], nucleoside-triphosphate [NTP]), and sugar esters of uridine diphosphate (UDPS) appeared in the carcinomas. Malignant tumors also showed a lower ratio of phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine (PE/PC) than benign conditions. Lower content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphocholine (GPC) and high content of the high-energy compound phosphocreatine (PCr) were associated with malignant tumors having high content of estrogen receptors (ER). High PCr content was also associated in the carcinomas with high progesterone receptors (PgR) content. In the benign tumors NDP and NTP were higher in tumors with high PgR content. The authors suggest that 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the breast can provide additional variables to diagnose malignancy, and when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), invasive procedures may be avoided. It also seems that levels of PCr and GPC obtained from the spectra can serve as markers to hormonal receptor status of breast carcinomas, and may be used in addition to the ER and PgR content to improve prediction of the response to hormonal therapy. Additional development requires in situ MRI and MRS combined studies. 
Spontaneous regression of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. This report describes the spontaneous regression of a biopsy-proved juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma that was first diagnosed when the child was age 11 years. The patient was followed up over a 12-year period during which he did not receive any therapy. Total involution of this lesion can be demonstrated by serial computed tomographic studies. Our report supports the theory of hormonal influence on this group of tumors and the possibility of spontaneous involution. 
Conservative management of anal leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcomas of the large intestine are unusual neoplasms, comprising less than 0.1% of all malignancies of the colon and rectum. Six cases of leiomyosarcoma of the anus have been reported. The optimal treatment for this neoplasm is not known. The standard surgical approach is abdominoperineal resection. The authors report the seventh case of this rare neoplasm and outline its treatment using local excision and iridium 192 brachytherapy in an attempt to preserve the anal sphincter. In selected patients, conservative surgery followed by radiation therapy may be an alternative to radical surgery, with the goals of local control of the disease and anal sphincter preservation. However, more experience is needed before this approach could be recommended routinely. 
Primary adenocarcinoma of bladder. Between April 1983 and December 1987, we have treated and followed 16 patients at the University of Southern California for adenocarcinoma of the bladder. In 10 patients, the cancer originated from a nonurachal source; all underwent radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion. The other 6 patients had an apparent urachal origin of their cancer. Half of these patients were treated with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion and half were treated initially with segmental cystectomy. Presenting characteristics (age, sex ratio, and symptoms) were similar for both groups. Three-year adjusted acturial tumor-free survival rates for the two groups were 48 percent and 31 percent, respectively. We advocate an aggressive approach of radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion for all invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder, regardless of location. 
Migraine pain associated with middle cerebral artery dilatation: reversal by sumatriptan. The combination of measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood velocity in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) by transcranial doppler sonography was used to investigate cerebrovascular involvement in migraine. Ten migraine patients with unilateral headache were studied during an attack and when they had been free of attacks for 5 days (non-attack). On both occasions they were given as intravenous infusion of sumatriptan (2 mg), a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, which relieved the symptoms within 30 min without affecting rCBF. The MCA velocity was normal on both sides on the non-attack day and on the unaffected side during the attack. However, during the attack the MCA velocity on the headache side was significantly lower than that on the non-headache side (45 vs 61 cm/s:mean difference 16.3 [95% confidence interval 10.3-22.3]; p = 0.02). The MCA velocity on the headache side returned to normal after treatment with sumatriptan and recovery. Since rCBF in the MCA supply territory was unaffected, the lower velocity can be explained only by dilatation of the MCA. The mean MCA diameter increase was estimated to be 20%. Thus, headache was associated with intracranial large arterial dilatation on the headache side. Sumatriptan predominantly had effects on the distended artery, which suggests that the 5-HT receptor system has a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. 
Treatment with intravenously administered gamma globulin of chronic relapsing colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin. We tested the hypothesis that children with chronic relapsing colitis induced by Clostridium difficile toxin have defective antibody responses to C. difficile toxins as a cause of their underlying illness. Six such children were tested for serum IgG and IgA antibody to C. difficile toxin A. These six children had lower IgG anti-toxin A levels than 24 healthy children (p = 0.026) and 18 healthy adults (p = 0.0008). Five patients treated with 400 mg intravenously administered gamma-globulin per kilogram every 3 weeks had significant increases in IgG (p = 0.01) but not IgA anti-toxin A (p = 0.406) levels, and all five had clinical resolution of their gastrointestinal symptoms as well as clearing of C. difficile cytotoxin B from their stools. These observations suggest that a deficiency of IgG anti-toxin A may predispose children to the development of chronic relapsing C. difficile-induced colitis. In such cases, intravenous gamma-globulin therapy may be effective in producing clinical remission. 
Bleeding peptic ulcer after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. A retrospective study of 112 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 232 with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) demonstrated that 16.7% of those with AAA and 1.6% of those with ASO had a history of gastroduodenal ulcer; 83% of these lesions with AAA were gastric ulcers. Ulcer bleeding after vascular reconstruction developed in seven patients with AAA and one with ASO. Serum fibrinogen levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with AAA than in those with ASO or controls. A prospective study showed that 25 (52.1%) of 48 patients with AAA and six (20.0%) of 30 patients with ASO had endoscopically proved gastroduodenal lesions before vascular reconstruction. None of them developed postoperative bleeding after treatment of both their gastroduodenal lesions and coagulopathy. Furthermore, the significant decrease in blood flow and prostaglandin content of gastric mucosa was demonstrated in patients with AAA. 
Recruitment of new osteoblasts and osteoclasts is the earliest critical event in the pathogenesis of human multiple myeloma. Considering the special relation of human multiple myeloma (MM) to bones, it is of importance to clarify the early steps of bone involvement in this disease. In this work, using bone histomorphometry (including histoenzymologic and kinetic studies for the first time), we have evaluated the bone remodeling (i.e., bone resorption and bone formation rates) of 16 individuals with early MM in comparison with that of 10 with benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) and that of 17 patients with previously untreated overt MM. A significantly increased osteoblastic recruitment was observed in the individuals with early MM when compared with those with BMG (P less than 0.01). A significant (P less than 0.01) increased bone resorption (i.e., eroded surfaces, osteoclast numbers and surfaces) was observed from the early stage of MM in comparison with the BMG status where bone resorption remained within the normal range. At the tissue level, there was no difference in terms of bone resorption between early and overt MM. On the other hand, osteoblast activity was significantly reduced in patients with overt MM (P less than 0.05 by comparison with those with early MM). A significant enhancement of osteoblastic recruitment with an increased generation of new osteoclasts is an early critical event in the pathogenesis of human MM. Of particular importance is the early stimulation of osteoblasts, since these cells produce high amounts of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor and a critical cytokine for the formation of osteoclasts in the bone marrow. 
Focal spared area in fatty liver simulating a mass. Scintigraphic evaluation. The characterization of focally spared areas in a fatty liver may at times be problematic. This report illustrates the unique diagnostic role that combined xenon-133/technetium-99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy can play in such cases. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: results of treatment and options in management. Twenty two patients (19 females) with focal nodular hyperplasia were seen between 1973 and 1989. Five were children, and all the adults were aged under 42 years (median 33 years). Fourteen patients (64%) were symptomatic on presentation. Twelve of the 14 adult women had taken the oral contraceptive pill. Twelve patients, nine of whom were symptomatic, underwent hepatic resection shortly after presentation. There were no deaths or major complications, and all remain well on follow up. Four patients underwent either hepatic artery embolisation or ligation. After an interval of six to 10 years they were asymptomatic and only one has histological evidence of residual focal nodular hyperplasia. Of five patients initially treated conservatively, two were asymptomatic and have remained so for three and 13 years. One of the three symptomatic patients became symptom free after stopping the contraceptive pill. The management of focal nodular hyperplasia requires a flexible approach. Lesions which are asymptomatic can be observed with regular ultrasound and treated if they enlarge or become symptomatic. Symptomatic patients who present while taking the contraceptive pill can also have a trial of conservative treatment. Other symptomatic patients, including those who previously took the pill, are best treated by surgical resection, and, where this is not possible, by embolisation. 
Postoperative retention of urine: a prospective urodynamic study. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the cause of post-operative retention of urine in elderly men. DESIGN--Prospective study. SETTING--Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. PATIENTS--32 consecutive men (median age 73, range 55-85) referred to the urology department who were unable to pass urine either within 48 hours after operation and required catheterisation (23) or after removal of a catheter inserted at the initial operation (nine). INTERVENTION--Intermittent self catheterisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urological investigation by medium fill and voiding cystometry within four weeks after operation, and minimum follow up three months thereafter. RESULTS--6 patients resumed normal voiding before urodynamic assessment, three proceeded straight to prostatectomy, and one was unfit for self catheterisation. Of 22 men who underwent urodynamic investigation, only five had bladder outflow obstruction, who subsequently had successful prostatectomy; 15 showed either a low pressure-low flow system (seven) or complete detrusor failure (eight) and two showed pelvic parasympathetic nerve damage. With intermittent self catheterisation spontaneous voiding returned in all but one man within a median of 8 weeks (range 6-32 weeks). Recovery of bladder function took significantly longer in men with detrusor failure than in those with an underactive bladder (median 10 weeks (range 6-32 weeks) v median 8 weeks (range 6-8 weeks); p = 0.05). Three months later all patients had re-established their own normal voiding pattern with minimal residual urine on ultrasonography and satisfactory flow rates. CONCLUSIONS--Postoperative urinary retention in elderly men is not an indication for prostatectomy; a normal pattern of micturition can be re-established by intermittent self catheterisation in most men. 
Are some antihypertensive therapies more efficacious than others in preventing complications and prolonging life? Antihypertensive therapy has been used for almost 35 years to reduce blood pressure and prevent morbidity and mortality related to the hypertensive state. Malignant, severe, and moderate hypertension have all been shown to be worthy of drug treatment, but controversy remains as to the degree of benefit that is achievable by treating milder hypertension. A variety of clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy reduces the incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy and the progression in severity of hypertension. The benefits with respect to prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) have been much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics have been the base therapy for the bulk of the hypertensive subjects studied to date who have not demonstrated reduced incidence of CHD. Therapy with beta-blockers has the potential for reducing CHD, but an analysis of four studies finds only two with positive results. On the other hand, since that study found reduced total mortality as well as CHD compared with thiazide diuretic, its findings cannot be ignored. Other questions deserving further investigation include how other antihypertensive therapies compare with respect to the risk reduction found with thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, the optimal posttreatment blood pressure, whether persons with mild hypertension benefit from therapy, whether women should be treated differently, and whether atherosclerosis may be affected by specific antihypertensive therapies. 
Pheochromocytoma with pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs: a paraneoplastic syndrome with possible relation to interleukin-6 production. Pheochromocytoma can cause several paraneoplastic syndromes. We report a patient with pheochromocytoma who exhibited pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs along with an elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. All of these abnormalities disappeared and serum IL-6 became undetectable by removal of the tumor. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of IL-6 in the tumor cells. It is suggested that pyrexia and the elevation of acute phase proteins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome with pheochromocytoma, and that the elaboration of IL-6 from pheochromocytoma may play an important role in the development of the syndrome. 
Slow toxins, biologic markers, and long-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific region. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a "slow toxin" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. 
Detection of the interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in psoriasiform dermatitis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 is a 10-kd protein produced by human keratinocytes following an exposure to interferon gamma. Keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques and within delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been shown to stain strongly with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody prepared against interferon-gamma-induced protein 10, suggesting a possible role for interferon gamma in the production of the lesions. A psoriasiform eruption has been seen in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Its severity appears to correlate with the degree of immunodeficiency in the early stages of AIDS. We stained 10 lesions of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS with the anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 antibody using immunoperoxidase techniques. As controls, we studied 10 lesions of non-AIDS psoriasis, six lesions of seborrheic dermatitis with psoriasiform hyperplasia, one lesion of lichen simplex chronicus, and four biopsy specimens of normal skin from patients with AIDS. In addition, normal skin specimens taken from patients with AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients at time of autopsy were examined. An identical, strong and diffuse staining pattern was seen in all cases of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS, non-AIDS psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. The specimens of normal skin showed only weak basal layer staining with anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10. Thus, the presence of interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in keratinocytes was associated with psoriasiform hyperplasia and could be detected in both AIDS-associated and classic psoriasis. 
Acute pancreatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus: necropsy of a case and review of the pancreatic vascular lesions. The role of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the development of acute pancreatitis is a matter of controversy since, in many cases, this complication has been attributed to the drugs administered. In this study, we present a patient diagnosed as having SLE who developed acute pancreatitis with no apparent cause aside from her basic disease, and in whose necropsy was observed vascular damage consisting of severe intimal proliferation. Pancreatic vascular lesions in previously reported patients with lupus are reviewed. 
Effect of elevated plasma norepinephrine on electrocardiographic changes in subarachnoid hemorrhage. We compared electrocardiographic abnormalities and plasma norepinephrine concentrations in 40 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage within the first 24 hours, at 72 hours, and after 1 week. In 20 patients with high plasma norepinephrine concentrations within the first 24 hours, sinus tachycardia (p less than 0.02) and negative T waves (p less than 0.01) were more frequent than in the 20 patients with normal plasma norepinephrine concentrations. After 72 hours, only sinus tachycardia (p less than 0.03) was found with increased frequency in the 26 patients with high plasma norepinephrine concentrations. Although 24 patients had high plasma norepinephrine concentrations after 1 week, we found no differences in the frequency of electrocardiographic abnormalities compared to patients with normal plasma norepinephrine. However, QTc prolongation, U waves, ST depression, and arrhythmias were found with similar frequency in patients with both high and normal plasma norepinephrine concentrations. We conclude that, with the exception of sinus tachycardia and negative T waves, electrocardiographic changes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage do not depend on elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations. 
Diagnostic imaging in cancer care. The role of cost/benefit analysis. As the cost of medical care rises, there is increasing need to analyze the costs and benefits of diagnostic imaging. A review of previous research shows reasonable success at defining costs and the ability to identify safety and risk, but limited data on defining benefits in economic terms. The technology to analyze costs and benefits is improving, and satisfactory research protocols and methods have recently become generally accepted. While research studies to determine costs and benefits or efficacy are themselves costly, time consuming, and difficult to perform in clinical practice, the wise allocation of medical resources in the US requires physicians in all specialties to evaluate the technology when we are responsible for its use. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Success of temporomandibular joint arthroscopy in disk displacement with and without reduction. Forty-three subjects with disk displacement without reduction (DNR) or disk displacement with reduction (DWR) underwent arthroscopic lysis and lavage of the temporomandibular joints. Both groups of subjects were assessed by clinical examination, a questionnaire, and joint imaging, to determine the impact of internal derangement type (DWR vs DNR) on postsurgical outcome. There were no significant differences in postsurgical outcomes between the two groups of meniscal disorders with respect to clinical and questionnaire data. However, the DNR group generally exhibited a smoother, less erratic recovery. After surgery dramatic improvements were in range of motion, pain, and function in both groups, although some level of residual pain and dietary limitation remained in approximately half the subjects. The incidence of joint sounds and deviation were not improved by surgery. Significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to imaging results. Arthroscopy had little effect on the disk positions of DNR subjects: 84% were unchanged after surgery, and the remaining 16% were improved. The disk position of DWR subjects appeared more labile, with 31% unchanged, 38% worsened, and 31% improved. 
Fecal occult blood testing. Guidelines for follow-up after positive findings. Fecal occult blood testing should be performed under optimal conditions to minimize false-positive test results. Obvious bleeding from the rectum or other sources during the test period should be investigated and testing should be postponed. When a fecal occult blood test is positive, colonoscopy is recommended as the definitive method of diagnosis and often of treatment. When a complete colonoscopy cannot be performed, sigmoidoscopy with air-contrast barium enema is the next best alternative for direct visualization of the distal bowel and indirect investigation of the proximal colon. 
Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage after bone marrow transplantation: radiographic findings in 39 patients. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication after bone marrow transplantation. We investigated the radiographic abnormalities that occurred in 39 transplantation patients with a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and correlated the findings with the patients' clinical course. The initial radiographic abnormalities after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed an average of 11 days after bone marrow transplantation, and the radiographic abnormalities preceded the clinical diagnosis by an average of 3 days. Twenty-seven patients initially had bilateral radiographic abnormalities; 10 initially had unilateral abnormalities (seven in the right lung, three in the left lung). Two patients had normal chest radiographs throughout their clinical course. All 37 patients with radiographic abnormalities had abnormalities involving the central portion of the lung, primarily the middle and lower lung zones. The initial radiographic pattern was interstitial in 27 and alveolar in 10. In 24 patients, radiographic abnormalities were initially judged to be mild; three were severe from the onset. Radiographic abnormalities rapidly worsened in most patients over 6 days. In 30 patients, diffuse bilateral radiographic abnormalities involving all lung zones developed. Eleven patients persisted in having only interstitial radiographic abnormalities; 26 had a confluent alveolar pattern. At the height of radiographic abnormalities, 27 cases were judged to be severe, and only one case was judged to be mild. The mortality rate in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was 77%. The radiographic abnormalities of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are nonspecific and usually precede the clinical diagnosis. The clinical course after hemorrhage is short, often resulting in death. 
Dissections of the cervicocerebral arteries. We present four cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to dissections of cervicocerebal arteries. The majority of patients presented with transient ischemic attacks and strokes, although one patient presented with headache and focal seizure. In addition to history and physical examination, the diagnostic evaluation of these patients included computed tomography scan, carotid duplex studies, angiogram, and, in some cases, magnetic resonance imaging studies. Initially, the patients were anticoagulated with heparin and then with warfarin for a period of six to eight weeks. The emergency physician must consider such dissections in younger patients with sudden neurologic deficits and no or few risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. In our experience, these are not rare syndromes; with proper workup, prompt diagnosis, and therapy, the prognosis is usually excellent. 
Midazolam use in the emergency department. Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory. 
Export of intracellular HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is related to viral replication. Serum and liver HBsAg bear an inverse relation to each other during the evolution of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and the quantity of HBsAg in tissue rises gradually with time. In this study, intracellular and extracellular levels of HBsAg were measured by radioimmunoassay in primary culture of hepatocytes from 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to determine a possible relationship with hepatitis B virus replication. Serum levels of HBsAg correlated with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.005, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.02) but inversely with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.05). In similar fashion, in vitro export of HBsAg was also related to the presence of active viral replication markers (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.02, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05) and negatively with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.001). Export of HBeAg also correlated positively with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.05 and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05). Further experiments indicated that intrahepatic pre-S1 and pre-S2 correlated closely with intrahepatic HBsAg, indicating that a failure to export HBsAg was unlikely to be attributable to deficient intracellular expression of pre-S1 or pre-S2. These data indicate that in vitro primary hepatocyte culture of hepatitis B virus-infected cells provides an accurate reflection of in vivo export of HBsAg and that this is closely related to the presence of active viral replication. 
Beta-receptor sensitivity in autonomic failure. We examined the cardiovascular, plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma renin (PRA) responses to isoproterenol infusion in patients with autonomic failure and in normal subjects. Slopes of the blood pressure response/dose relationships were more negative in patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure (PAF) than in normal subjects, consistent with impaired baroreflex modulation. A shift to the left in patients with PAF suggests beta-adrenergic receptor supersensitivity. In normal subjects, the increase in plasma NE and PRA was proportional to the log of the plasma isoproterenol level. Isoproterenol infusion did not increase plasma NE or PRA in either patient group despite a reduction in mean blood pressure. Reflexive cardiovascular and renal mechanisms appear to play a role in eliciting the plasma NE and PRA responses to isoproterenol infusion in normal subjects. 
Microalbuminuria in patients with essential hypertension. Effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and of a calcium channel blocker. Several patients with essential hypertension manifest an abnormal (greater than 30 mg/24 h) urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Since microalbuminuria is considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, studies are currently being undertaken to determine the effect of various antihypertensive agents on UAE, on the assumption that a reduction of UAE might result in improved prognosis in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups of 12. The first group received 20 mg/day enalapril for 8 weeks, followed by 20 to 40 mg/day nitrendipine for 8 more weeks. The second group received nitrendipine for 8 weeks, followed by enalapril. Mean arterial pressure decreased similarly during both therapeutic regimens in the two groups of patients. In patients of group 1, UAE decreased significantly (P less than .01) from 74 +/- 7.0 to 33 +/- 5.8 mg/24 h after 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril; during the following 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, UAE increased to 58 +/- 5.3 mg/24 h (P less than .02). In patients of group 2, UAE did not change during the first 8 weeks of therapy with nitrendipine despite a significant reduction in blood pressure; subsequently, after 8 weeks of therapy with enalapril, UAE decreased from 62 +/- 9.2 to 31 +/- 4.8 mg/24 h (P less than .01). This study demonstrates that enalapril but not nitrendipine may reduce UAE in patients with essential hypertension despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. The significance of microalbuminuria and the impact of the normalization of UAE on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension remains to be determined. 
Interaction of sodium and volume in fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage. Some measures of the efficacy of fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage are blood volume restitution (BVR) and attenuation of the neuroendocrine response. We compared the effectiveness of resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl and 3.0% NaCl in chronically prepared awake dogs after 30% hemorrhage. Each dog was bled on four occasions and resuscitated by four protocols: 1) full resuscitation (infusion to return and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at control +/- 10 mm Hg) with 3.0% NaCl (HS); 2) full resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl (NS); 3) under-resuscitation with a volume of 0.9% NaCl equal to the subject's previous 3.0% NaCl requirement (SV); and 4) no fluid therapy (NR). Approximately three times more volume was needed to restore MAP with NS vs. HS, and thus the amount of Na administered was not different in these groups. Net volume balance was positive in the NS and SV groups but negative in the HS group due to marked saline diuresis. Net Na balance was positive in all three fluid-treated groups, but significantly higher in the HS group (p less than 0.01). MAP remained below baseline in the SV and NR groups (p less than 0.05). BVR exceeded 100% in NS and HS early in resuscitation, but BVR was not sustained in the HS group. Total plasma protein increased in all three fluid treated groups. Responses of all hormones were completely attenuated in the NS group. ACTH, cortisol, and AVP responses were promptly attenuated in the HS group, but remained greater than control. In the SV group, all hormone levels except renin returned to control values, but more slowly than the other groups. ACTH and cortisol correlated best with BVR; AVP, PRA, and aldosterone correlated with MAP restoration. In summary, resuscitation with either HS or NS can achieve similar MAP restoration. Hypertonic saline produces a more rapid increase in BVR and MAP, but the BVR improvement is transient. Resuscitation with HS incurs an intracellular water debt which is aggravated by a saline diuresis. Hormonal attenuation is linked either to BVR (ACTH, cortisol) or to MAP restoration (renin, AVP). Thus the optimal resuscitation regimen may consist of initial infusion of hypertonic saline followed by sufficient hypotonic solution to restore interstitial fluid volume and normal cellular hydration. 
Neurogenic sarcoma of the sinonasal tract. Five cases of a rare malignant sinonasal tumour of neurofibromatous nature are described. The term neurogenic sarcoma (or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour) is advocated instead of malignant schwannoma. The clinicopathological features of this tumour are described, and the different diagnosis are discussed. The necessity of using immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of sinonasal tumours of fibromatous nature is emphasized. The clinical management consists of radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinically there seems to be a high-grade and a low-grade type of sinonasal neurogenic sarcoma, however, this could not be distinguished histologically in the present series. 
Dowling-Degos disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, and multiple keratoacanthomas. A disorder that may be caused by a single underlying defect in pilosebaceous epithelial proliferation. We report a case in which one patient had Dowling-Degos disease (reticulate pigmented anomaly of the flexures), hidradenitis suppurativa, and multiple keratoacanthomas. Abnormal epithelial proliferation involving mainly the pilosebaceous apparatus has been recognized in all three conditions. We speculate that a single underlying defect in follicular epithelial proliferation, characterized by variable expressivity, accounts for the coexistence of these clinically distinct disorders of follicular derivation. 
Fractures of the penis: therapeutic approach and long-term results. Injury to the external male genitalia is considered, with attention focused on accidental fracture of the corpora cavernosa (by coitus or masturbation). Such injuries are often complicated by urethral lesions. We present 13 patients with either simple or complicated fracture of the penis, all of whom were operated on between 2 h and 8 days following injury, with excellent functional results. The need for immediate surgery is emphasised, in order to avoid erectile failure and curvature, which are typical complications of conservative treatment. Surgery consists of complete evacuation of haematoma, curettage and repair of the albuginea. If the fracture is associated with urethral disruption, the latter is also repaired. 
Acquired perforating dermatosis. Transepidermal elimination of DNA material and possible role of leukocytes in pathogenesis. A patient had acquired perforating dermatosis and suffered from renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and lupus vulgaris. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the bulk of the coarse granular basophilic material being extruded by transepidermal elimination was of nuclear origin obviously derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes that were particularly abundant in an early, nonperforated lesion. At the lower boundary of the material being eliminated transepidermally, leukocytes were seen to accumulate, to undergo pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and to transform into nuclear debris. As a minor component, the material contained collagen fibers with altered staining qualities and, in an early lesion, elastic fibers. We speculate that accumulation, disintegration, and enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may represent an important, hitherto disregarded driving force in transepidermal elimination. Lysosomal enzymes may later be responsible for the alteration of staining properties in collagen fibers, the degradation of elastic fibers, and for opening up the transepidermal route by impairing intercellular keratinocyte cohesion. 
Heterogeneity in oxygen diffusion around venous ulcers. The pathogenesis of venous ulceration is thought to involve the formation of fibrin cuffs around dermal capillaries. Consistent with a barrier effect of fibrin, it has been shown that the dermal diffusion of oxygen, as measured by transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), is decreased in limbs affected by venous ulcer. However, it is unknown whether oxygen diffusion around the perimeter of venous ulcers is uniformly affected. In this study, we investigated TcPO2 values at four different quadrants around the ulcers of 14 patients, the contralateral leg of five patients with unilateral ulcers, and the leg of six normal individuals. These values were also compared to TcPO2 measurements at the chest. Our results indicate that, whereas TcPO2 values in limbs affected by venous ulcers are much lower than normal, there is a great deal of variability in oxygen diffusion around individual ulcers. These findings may represent a heterogeneity in the disease process affecting the leg. 
Association between development of lower lip cancer and tobacco habits. Tobacco use is considered to increase the risk of tumor induction. The purpose of this case-controlled investigation was to assess the association of tobacco habits and development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. Sixty-one patients treated for lower lip cancer, aged between 42 and 90 years, were studied. Age- and sex-matched healthy controls showed a similar exposure to tobacco in years and a comparable distribution of tobacco habits. Although the mean exposure factor (duration times exposure) was greater in the tumor group, no intimate correlation between lip cancer and tobacco was demonstrated. However, an increased, although small, occurrence of herpes labialis lesions was found in cancer patients. The hypothesis is presented that smokers experiencing recurrent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections are more liable to tumor initiation, which issue will be subjected to a future study. 
A critical review of the evidence supporting a relationship between impaired fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. We critically evaluated the evidence for an association between venous thromboembolism and impaired fibrinolytic activity, as determined by global tests of fibrinolytic activity or specific tests for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor. A computer-assisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. The strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. It is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis. Whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear, since randomized clinical trials that used interventions to enhance fibrinolytic activity produced inconsistent results. 
Comparison of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the postoperative assessment of residual acoustic tumor. Ten patients with surgically confirmed residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas, imaged by both computerized tomography (CT) with iodine contrast and magnetic resonance (MR) with and without gadolinium enhancement, are reviewed to identify the strengths and limitations of MR as compared with CT imaging. MR imaging offers superior anatomic resolution in multiple imaging planes without ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and has adverse effects on some patients. CT imaging offers good anatomic resolution, but in only one or two planes. CT is both less expensive and generally well tolerated, but allergy to the iodine contrast is not uncommon. The cases presented demonstrate the adequacy of CT imaging of residual tumor. However, in some cases MR imaging provided important additional detail. MR imaging also demonstrated postoperative changes within the brain stem and cerebellum. In our experience, CT imaging remains a satisfactory, unambiguous approach to the assessment of known postoperative residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas. MR imaging provides superior resolution, however, and should be used when better definition of tumor detail is needed for management decisions or when multiple follow-up scans are anticipated, so that the exposure to ionizing radiation is limited. MR is also useful to investigate postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Postoperative changes and residual tumors are more difficult to interpret on MR than on CT. Guidelines are proposed to help distinguish residual tumor from postoperative changes and scarring. 
Elevation of serum interleukin-6 concentration precedes acute-phase response and reflects severity in acute pancreatitis. Experimental studies have shown that interleukin-6 induces all major acute-phase proteins in the liver, including C-reactive protein. In 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were determined daily during the first week of hospitalization. Patients were divided into three groups according to clinical criteria: mild pancreatitis (less than or equal to 1 complication; n = 25), severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 2 complications; n = 15), and lethal outcome (n = 10). Patients with mild disease showed initially slightly elevated levels of interleukin-6 (22.0 +/- 9.8 U/mL) that decreased to low levels within 4 days (5.0 +/- 1.0 U/mL). In patients with severe pancreatitis, serum concentrations of interleukin-6 were initially clearly elevated (35.0 +/- 7.5 U/mL) and remained slightly elevated until day 7 (13.0 +/- 2.0 U/mL). Patients with lethal outcome had markedly elevated initial interleukin-6 concentrations (61.0 +/- 15.0 U/mL) that decreased but were still elevated at day 7 (26.0 +/- 2.5 U/mL). In all three groups, C-reactive protein concentrations followed the course of interleukin-6 concentrations by 1 day. There was a positive correlation between maximal interleukin 6 concentrations and maximal increases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (r = 0.66). At days 1 and 2, increased (greater than 15 U/mL) interleukin-6 concentrations (positive predictive value, 91%; negative predictive value, 82%) predicted a severe or lethal course of the disease more accurately than elevated [greater than 0.10 g/L (greater than 10 mg/dL)] C-reactive protein concentrations (positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 79%). In conclusion, elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 followed by increased levels of C-reactive protein reflect the severity of acute pancreatitis. 
The high risk of death by alcohol related diseases in subjects diagnosed as diabetic and impaired glucose tolerant: the Paris Prospective Study after 15 years of follow-up. The 15 year mortality rates and causes of death are reported for the Paris Prospective Study cohort of 7180 working men, aged between 44 and 55 years who attended the first follow-up examination. All subjects were classified as normoglycaemic, impaired glucose tolerant or diabetic according to the WHO criteria, following an oral glucose tolerance test. The relative risks of death in comparison to the normoglycaemic group were 1.6 for impaired glucose tolerant and 2.3 for diabetic subjects; for death due to coronary heart disease: 1.7 and 2.3 respectively; for death due to alcohol and cirrhosis: 7.0 and 13.3 respectively. It appears that in this cohort a proportion of subjects screened as diabetic have impaired liver function and disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, due to excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol should be investigated as a possible risk factor for diabetes, particularly in epidemiological studies where diabetes is diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test and the population has a high consumption of alcohol. 
Prevalence of liver disease in cystic fibrosis. To assess the prevalence, demography, and clinical features of liver disease among patients with cystic fibrosis the case notes of 524 patients of all ages who were attending the cystic fibrosis clinic were studied. Computer databases were used to establish the condition of the liver in a further 576 such patients. The overall prevalence of overt liver disease indicated by the presence of an enlarged liver or spleen (or both) was 4.2%. The age related prevalence rose to a peak in adolescence, and then fell in patients over 20 years old. The implied increase in mortality among those with liver disease was not explained by deaths from liver disease, which were rare. Male patients were significantly more affected than female, the ratio being 3:1 among adolescents. Increasing prevalence of liver disease in patients with cystic fibrosis is, therefore, not just a result of longevity. 
Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content in advanced gastric cancer and its relationship with prognosis. Cell nuclear DNA content was determined by flow cytometric analysis in 270 patients with deeply infiltrating (beyond the submucosa) cancer, so-called advanced gastric cancer. Aneuploidy was observed in 150 cases (55.6%). Multivariate analysis showed that the DNA ploidy pattern was the third significant prognostic factor behind peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis. The 5-year survival rate of diploid patients (62.9%) was significantly higher than that of aneuploid patients (22.7%) (P less than 0.01). This trend was most clear in patients with Stage III and IV tumors. Among aneuploid cases the high DNA index group indicated a worse prognosis than the low DNA index group. It was thus assumed that the DNA ploidy pattern was a useful prognostic indicator of advanced gastric cancer. 
Endometrial carcinoma in the cancer family syndrome. The study group consisted of 26 women with endometrial adenocarcinoma belonging to 19 cancer families. Age at the onset of cancer, the stage and histologic differentiation of the tumor, initial symptoms, other malignancies, 5-year survival, and transmission of cancer to descendants were studied. The focus was on the importance of endometrial carcinoma in the tumor spectrum. The diagnosis of cancer family was delayed in 14 of the 19 families because endometrial carcinoma was not included in the primary diagnostic carcinoma. This delay may have been harmful to 16 family members who had carcinomas later in life. In ten of the 14 women with multiple malignancies, endometrial adenocarcinoma was the primary malignancy diagnosed, thus enabling the suspicion of a gene carrier and screening for subsequent malignancies. The authors concluded that endometrial carcinoma is a significant component of cancer family syndrome and should be included in the main criteria of Lynch syndrome II. 
Simultaneous occurrence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative diseases. A report of two cases. Two previously unreported patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma associated with systemic low-grade B cell proliferations are presented. The first patient had Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and the second had simultaneous chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The use of immunosuppressive drugs or a genetic predisposition may have contributed to the second malignancy. However, the possibility that malignant helper/inducer T lymphocytes were a factor in the promotion of the proliferation of B cells cannot be excluded. 
Placental examination in a clinical setting. Placental examination has been proved to be of clinical value in cases selected because of gestational complications, unusual disorders of mother or infant, perinatal death, problems in perinatal diagnosis, and multiple pregnancy. Ten percent to 15% of births meet these criteria for selection. Causes of perinatal death, such as placental abruption, cord accidents, placental infarction, infection, and hematologic disorders, have been demonstrated. Clinically occult abnormalities, including chronic infections, maternal vascular disease, neoplasms, and storage diseases, have been recognized. Amniotic lesions and single umbilical artery have directed attention to fetal malformations. Monozygosity has been documented by monochorionic placentation. As a diagnostic source, the placenta has contributed to clinical care, understanding of disabilities among surviving children, and insight of forensic value. Limitations of placental studies stem from their qualitative nature and from gaps in current knowledge of gestational pathophysiology. 
Monomelic amyotrophy in siblings. Monomelic amyotrophy is a rare, benign motor neuron disorder. Electrophysiologic studies are suggestive of localized chronic anterior horn cell disease. Two young siblings are reported with monomelic amyotrophy who had proximal muscle weakness confined to one arm. We propose that monomelic amyotrophy, at least in this family, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. 
Right- and left-arm blood pressure discrepancies in vascular surgery patients. To identify a relationship between atherosclerotic vascular disease and differences in blood pressure between the right and left arms, blood pressure differences between arms were measured in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD, n = 58), in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD, n = 38), and in patients with no evidence of atherosclerotic disease, who served as a control group (n = 38). The incidence and magnitude of right and left arm pressure difference determined by the oscillometric technique were compared between the patient groups. The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 20 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (21%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (3%) (P less than or equal to 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.01). The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 45 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (10%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (0%) (P less than 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.05). Patients with PVD also had a greater incidence of right and left arm difference than did those with CAD or controls for mean and diastolic blood pressures. Of all patients with a systolic difference greater than 10 mmHg, neither the right nor the left arm blood pressure was consistently higher: 21 of 35 (60%) had a higher pressure in the right arm, and 14 of 35 (40%) had a higher pressure in the left arm (P = 0.33). Gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and age were not associated with a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms. 
The origin of symptoms on the brain-gut axis in functional dyspepsia. It was hypothesized that symptoms in functional dyspepsia are originated by an altered mechanism at the brain-gut axis (one or several) in the process of gastric accommodation to a meal. To test the key mechanisms potentially involved in symptomatic gastric accommodation, the sensorial responses (on a 0-10 perception score) and the gastric tone responses (by electronic barostat) to either gastric accommodation (n = 10) or to cold stress (n = 10) were measured in 20 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls. The mechanical accommodation of the stomach to gastric distention (compliance) was similar in patients (52 +/- 8 mL/mm Hg) and controls (57 +/- 6 mL/mm Hg). However, isobaric gastric distention elicited more upper abdominal discomfort in dyspeptics than in controls (perception scores, 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5, respectively; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.005). Cold stress induced a similar gastric relaxatory response in dyspeptics and controls (delta vol, 145 mL +/- 40 mL vs. 141 mL +/- 42 mL, respectively); hand perception (scores, 8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and autonomic responses were also similar. It is concluded that an abnormal afferent sensorial pathway (altered gastric perception) may be a major mechanism of symptom production in functional dyspepsia. 
Pretranslational regulation of albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing mice. The role of anorexia and undernutrition. Hepatic albumin synthesis, serum albumin turnover, and hepatic albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) content were evaluated in mice bearing a transplantable low differentiated tumor (MCG 101). Results obtained on tumor-bearing mice were compared with results obtained from non-tumor-bearing animals that were either freely fed, food restricted so that their body composition was similar to tumor-bearing animals (pair-weighed), fed a protein-free diet for 5 days, or fasted for 48 hours. Tumor-bearing animals became hypoalbuminemic (33 +/- 5 vs. 44 +/- 3 g/L in freely fed mice), which could be explained by both depressed albumin synthesis (1.95% +/- 0.20% vs. 2.67% +/- 0.27%/h in freely fed mice) and increased albumin degradation. Pair-weighed and protein-calorie malnourished controls had reductions in albumin synthesis (1.81% +/- 0.18% and 1.67% +/- 0.17%/h, respectively) similar to tumor-bearing animals, and the starved controls had the lowest synthetic rates (1.07% +/- 0.10%/h). Albumin degradation was increased only in tumor-bearing animals. Hepatic albumin mRNA in undernourished animals was less (tumor bearing, 32% +/- 5%; pair weighed, 47% +/- 4%; 48 hours fasted, 18% +/- 2%; and protein-calorie malnourished, 26% +/- 3%) than 50% of the mRNA content in the livers of freely fed control mice. Messenger RNA-directed synthesis of albumin in vitro was also depressed to a variable degree in tumor-bearing and malnourished non-tumor-bearing controls. The hypoalbuminemia in tumor-bearing animals could not be prevented by daily injections of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 1 microgram/g body wt), but the hepatic acute phase protein serum amyloid P decreased from 157 +/- 12 to 103 +/- 9 micrograms/mL in indomethacin-treated tumor-bearing mice (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that increased albumin degradation seen in tumor-bearing animals cannot be explained by associated malnutrition, whereas tumor-associated malnutrition can explain to a large extent the depressed albumin synthesis. Decreased albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing animals correlated in part with a decreased quantity of liver albumin mRNA. The results of the current study are consistent with either a reduced transcription of the albumin gene or a change in albumin mRNA processing and stability communicated by anorexia and malnutrition. 
Misdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma. We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation. We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case. 
In vivo footprinting of MHC class II genes: bare promoters in the bare lymphocyte syndrome. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are coordinately regulated and show tissue-specific expression. With the use of in vivo footprinting, common promoter sites in these genes were found to be occupied only in cells that expressed the genes, in spite of the presence of the promoter binding proteins. In vivo analysis of mutant cell lines that exhibited coordinate loss of class II MHC expression, including several from individuals with bare lymphocyte syndrome, revealed two in vivo phenotypes. One suggests a defect in gene activation, whereas the other suggests a defect in promoter accessibility. 
Neurenteric cyst located dorsal to the cervical spine: case report. A patient with a neurenteric cyst located dorsal to the cervical spine and associated with occult cervical spinal dysraphism is described. The embryological theories that might explain the occurrence of such a lesion are discussed. 
Prevention of irradiation-induced bowel discomfort by sucralfate: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study when treating localized pelvic cancer. Sucralfate, an aluminum hydroxide complex of sulfated sucrose used in the treatment of gastric ulcer, was shown to prevent irradiation-induced diarrhea and bowel discomfort significantly in patients treated for pelvic cancer with external radiotherapy with intent to cure. The double-blind placebo-controlled study included 70 patients with carcinoma of the prostate and urinary bladder without distant metastasis (T1-4NO1xMO) and performance status of greater than or equal to 90% Karnofsky scale. Radiotherapy was administered in a conventional manner with MeV photons and a four-field technique. The total dose was 62-66 Gy and total treatment time of 6.5 weeks. Dose granules of sucralfate or placebo were dispensed to each patient 2 weeks after radiation started and continued for 6 weeks. All analyses were performed blindly. Seven of 34 evaluable patients in the placebo group and 18 of 32 evaluable patients in the sucralfate group did not present with diarrhea during the observation period. The frequency of defecation and stool consistency were significantly improved by sucralfate. Fourteen patients in the placebo group and only three in the sucralfate group required symptomatic therapy with loperamide. There was no evidence of adverse effects associated with the use of sucralfate. Sucralfate can be of beneficial value in diminishing the bowel discomfort during radiotherapy of pelvic malignancies, and the earlier proposed mechanisms of action (e.g., protection of denuded mucosa, cytoprotective properties, binding bile acids) can also be valid for the current effects of sucralfate. 
Phosphate diabetes associated with bone metastases of oat cell lung cancer. Although the link between phosphate diabetes and neoplasm or benign mesenchymal tumors has been well documented, the nature of the phosphaturia factor remains unknown. We describe two cases of phosphate diabetes associated with bronchogenic cancer. In these case reports, we suggest that fibroblasts or osteoblasts synthesize a phosphate eliminating substance. 
A mutant alpha subunit of Gi2 induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. In a recently discovered class of oncogenes, GTPase-inhibiting mutations constitutively activate alpha subunits of signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Somatic mutations in a subclass of endocrine tumors are found in the arginine-179 codon of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2), creating the putative gip2 oncogene. We have tested the ability of gip2 to mediate neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in tissue culture. Expression of a mutant alpha i2 cDNA encoding cysteine in place of arginine-179 (alpha i2-R179C) caused Rat-1 cells to grow to a higher density in monolayer culture, to lose anchorage dependence, and to form tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, expression of alpha i2-R179C failed to alter growth or tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that gip2 is an oncogene, by the criterion that it induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. Failure of gip2 to transform NIH 3T3 cells is in keeping with clinical indications that gip2 is a tissue-selective oncogene. 
Colorectal cancer: cross-sectional imaging for staging of primary tumor and detection of local recurrence. This review describes the use of cross-sectional imaging in the staging of colorectal carcinoma and detection of local recurrence. The contributions of CT, MR imaging, and sonography are discussed and illustrated. Colorectal carcinoma is the second most common tumor in the United States and the most common cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The prognosis for patients with this neoplasm is closely related to the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis. Accurate noninvasive preoperative assessment of tumor stage by one or a combination of radiologic techniques would enable appropriate treatment to be planned in each case. Also, determination of possible tumor recurrence would permit effective monitoring of success of therapy and surgical intervention for recurrent disease before widespread metastasis occurs. 
Stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix: clinicopathologic features related to survival. Three hundred forty-five patients with stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 through 1985. The overall cumulative 5-year survival was 89%. The clinical characteristics included mean age 44.6 years, nulliparity 10%, married 93%, obese 38%, hypertension 32%, diabetes mellitus 5%, smoking 54%, symptoms of bleeding 68%, positive cytologic smear 83%. Lymph nodes were diseased in 45 of 261 (17%) with 26 unilateral (10%) and 19 bilateral (7%). Tumor differentiation showed: grade 1, 112 (33%); grade 2, 144 (42%); grade 3, 86 (25%). Factors that did not influence survival included age, presence or absence of positive cervical cytologic smear, the interval from previous papanicolaou smear, hypertension, smoking history, patient's blood type, and transfusion at radical hysterectomy. In all patients survival was significantly influenced by the following features: tumor classified as well differentiated (95%) or poorly differentiated (82%); tumor size less than 3 cm (91%) or greater than 3 cm (76%); negative lymph nodes (93%) or positive lymph nodes (61%). When three or fewer lymph nodes were involved, the survival was 79% compared with 33% when four or more lymph nodes were involved. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival was significantly influenced by the amount of residual cervical disease: no residual disease, 100%; less than 50% penetration, 96%; greater than 50% penetration, 83%. Involvement of the lower uterine segment reduced survival to 73% compared with 95% when the lower segment was uninvolved. One hundred seventeen patients without angiolymphatic invasion had a 97% cumulative 5-year survival whereas 70 patients without disease in the lymph nodes but with angiolymphatic invasion had an 88% cumulative 5-year survival rate. A Cox model, multiple proportional hazard analysis was performed for all patients, and the factors that influenced survival included tumor grade, tumor size, presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes, and diabetes mellitus. In patients undergoing radiation therapy, the tumor grade and size were significant factors in survival. In patients undergoing radical hysterectomy, survival was influenced by the depth of cervical penetration and lower uterine segment involvement whereas the tumor grade, tumor size, patient's age, and removal of ovaries were not significant. 
Adjuvant effect of human growth hormone with an inactivated flavivirus vaccine. Vaccines made by inactivating pathogenic microorganisms have been dramatically successful in controlling diseases in humans and animals. Despite their successes, they have a major disadvantage in that several inoculations are required for them to be effective. To overcome this problem, a commercial inactivated vaccine preparation against tickborne encephalitis was combined with human growth hormone (HGH). This formulation produced complete protection in a murine model with only one dose of vaccine, apparently by binding hormone and antigen to an insoluble matrix containing aluminium hydroxide. Thus it is postulated that when virus-specific lymphocytes are attracted to the site of injection, the hormone is at a high local concentration and stimulates the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells. The development of genetically engineered HGH now gives unlimited supplies of hormone, potentially resulting in an increase in efficacy of a wide variety of vaccines, especially those needing prolonged immunization schedules such as those being developed to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
Segregation analysis reveals evidence of a major gene for Alzheimer disease. In an attempt to resolve the relative influences of major genes, multifactorial heritability, and cohort effects on the susceptibility to Alzheimer disease (AD), complex segregation analysis was performed on 232 nuclear families. All families were consecutively ascertained through a single proband who was referred for diagnostic evaluation of a memory disorder. The results suggest that susceptibility to AD is determined, in part, by a major autosomal dominant allele with an additional multifactorial component. Single-locus, polygenic, sporadic, and no-transmission models, as well as recessive inheritance of the major effect, were significantly rejected. Excess transmission from the heterozygote was marginally significant and probably reflects the presence of phenocopies or perhaps the existence of two or more major loci for AD. The frequency of the AD susceptibility allele was estimated to be .038, but the major locus accounts for only 24% of the transmission variance, indicating a substantial role for other genetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the causation of AD. 
The clinical management of cirrhosis. The discipline of hepatology is being rapidly advanced by several methods of investigation, most notably those of molecular and genetic biology. The polymerase chain reaction holds very great promise in unraveling the implications of hepatic virus infections. At the present time, we have no method of reversing established cirrhosis, and those with life threatening impairment of liver function can only look to liver transplants for salvage. The clinician can therefore best serve by identifying liver disease before cirrhosis and its complications occur. With effective case finding, and the continued development of therapeutic interventions directed toward known or suspected etiologic and pathogenic factors, many productive, high-quality years can be added to the lifespans of many patients. 
Subretinal neovascularization in systemic lupus erythematosus. Choroidal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs infrequently. We describe a patient with unusual manifestations of lupus oculopathy: prominent choroidal vasculopathy associated with multiple chorioretinal scars and subretinal neovascularization in the macular area. Choroidal disease was the primary feature of ocular involvement. SLE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with inflammatory choroidal lesions. 
Rationale for development of low-molecular-weight heparins and their clinical potential in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. Interest in low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as potential antithrombotic agents was stimulated by two observations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The first was finding that LMWH fractions prepared from unfractionated heparin (UFH) progressively lost their ability to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) while retaining their ability to inhibit Factor Xa. The second was the observation that LMWHs prepared by chemical depolarization of UFH are antithrombotic in experimental animal models but produce less microvascular bleeding in experimental models for an equivalent antithrombotic effect than the UFH from which they are derived. Subsequently, it was shown that LMWHs inhibit platelet function and impair vascular permeability less than standard heparin and that LMWHs have a longer biological half-life than standard heparin. A number of LMWHs have been evaluated in clinical trials in general and orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous thrombosis. LMWHs are highly effective in orthopedic surgery, where they appear to be more effective than standard heparin. LMWHs have also been shown to be either as effective or more effective than UFH in preventing postoperative thrombosis following general surgery. In preliminary studies, LMWHs appear to be as effective as standard heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis, but larger studies are required using clinically relevant outcome measures. 
Acute lung injury induced by phospholipase A2. Structural and functional changes. On the basis of the observation that serum levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are elevated in pancreatitis and systemic sepsis, and the association of these conditions with the subsequent development of acute lung injury, the present investigation examined the structural and physiologic consequences of intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult male rats. Rats received direct intratracheal instillation of either control vehicle or 40,000 units/kg of PLA2 repurified from Naja naja venom. Animals treated with PLA2 showed higher cumulative mortality (33% versus 0%, n = 79; p less than 0.01) than did their control littermates. The PLA2-treated animals showed histologic evidence of acute lung injury characterized by interstitial and alveolar edema, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and alveolar wall thickening, which reached maximal severity 48 h after enzyme instillation. Forty-eight hours after PLA2 administration experimental animals had lower arterial oxygen tensions (73.9 +/- 7.66 mm Hg versus 96.7 +/- 2.52 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), higher alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (35.3 +/- 6.3 mm Hg versus 18.8 +/- 1.42 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and higher wet-dry lung weight ratios (5.08 +/- 0.26, mean +/- SEM, n = 7 versus 3.29 +/- 0.08, n = 3; p less than 0.002) than did control animals. Lung lavage from experimental animals 48 h after PLA2 instillation showed increased total cell counts [(26.6 +/- 5.04) x 10(6) cells versus (4.69 +/- 1.48) x 10(6) cells; p less than 0.01], an increased percentage of neutrophils (34.2 +/- 4.6% versus 1.25 +/- 0.25%, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), and increased protein concentrations in lavage fluid (0.38 +/- 0.06 mg/ml, mean +/- SEM, n = 4 versus 0.27 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, n = 5; p less than 0.05). The histologic and physiologic abnormalities had largely resolved by 240 h. These results suggest that PLA2 may be a potent mediator of lung inflammation and that intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult rats may provide a useful experimental model of acute lung injury. 
Word deafness and auditory cortical function. A case history and hypothesis. A patient who already had Wernicke's aphasia due to a left temporal lobe lesion suffered a severe deterioration specifically of auditory language comprehension, subsequent to right temporal lobe infarction. A detailed comparison of his new condition with his language status before the second stroke revealed that the newly acquired deficit was limited to tasks related to auditory input. Further investigations demonstrated a speech perceptual disorder, which we analysed as due to deficits both at the level of general auditory processes and at the level of phonetic analysis. We discuss some arguments related to hemisphere specialization of phonetic processing and to the disconnection explanation of word deafness that support the hypothesis of word deafness being generally caused by mixed deficits. 
Outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. 
Prevalence and incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy. We measured the prevalence and incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy in the Northern Health Region of England, UK. Patients were identified from the records of the Regional Neurological Centre and Muscular Dystrophy Group laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, and by writing to local doctors. We used cDNA probes and/or dystrophin immunolabelling of muscle-biopsy samples to prove the diagnosis of all cases. Results were compared with the known prevalence and incidence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 73 patients alive and resident in the Northern Health Region were identified, giving a prevalence rate of 2.38/100,000. This compares with a prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy of 2.48/100,000. The cumulative birth incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy (at least 1 in 18 450 male live births) was about one third that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1 in 5618 male live births), suggesting that the disorder is more common than previously thought. 
Open lung biopsy does not correlate with pulmonary function after the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Abnormalities of pulmonary function occur following the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To determine if open lung biopsy (OLB) during ARDS predicts late pulmonary function abnormalities, we examined nine survivors of ARDS who had OLB during ARDS. Open lung biopsy was performed within two weeks of the diagnosis of ARDS, and the following were scored by a pulmonary pathologist as to extent and severity: hyaline membranes (HM), interstitial fibrosis (IF), air space organization (AO), interstitial cellularity (IC), and type 2 cell proliferation (T2C). Pulmonary function tests performed at least one year after ARDS were also used for analysis. Percent predicted Dco, TLC, DL/VA, and FVC were regressed against extent, severity, and combined scores. No significant correlation was found despite impressive histologic abnormalities. These data suggest that the severity and extent of HM, IF, AO, T2C, or IC do not correlate with lung function following ARDS. 
Effects of different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on ischemic isolated rat hearts: relationship between cardiac ACE inhibition and cardioprotection. We determined the relationship between cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and anti-ischemic efficacy of several structurally different ACE inhibitors or their prodrug esters perfused through the isolated rat heart. Seven ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril, however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be important in mediating their cardioprotective actions. 
Endosonographic TNM staging of extrahepatic bile duct cancer: comparison with pathological staging. Endosonography was performed preoperatively in 33 patients with common bile duct carcinoma and in 43 patients with carcinoma of the common hepatic duct and its bifurcation. The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. Endosonography was accurate in the evaluation of the depth of tumor infiltration. Overall accuracy for common bile duct carcinoma and common hepatic duct carcinoma was 82.8% and 85%, respectively. Endosonography was helpful in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases but not accurate in diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes. With common bile duct carcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with progressive depth of tumor infiltration. No such correlation was found in common hepatic duct carcinomas. In the staging of distant metastasis, this technique was limited by the low-penetration depth of ultrasonography. Thus, additional transcutaneous ultrasonography or computed tomography was necessary for complete staging. The routine use of the biopsy channel for endosonographically guided aspiration puncture will further enhance the diagnostic value of endosonography in the future. 
Does metoclopramide reduce the length of ileus after colorectal surgery? A prospective randomized trial. Between August 1988 and September 1989, 100 consecutive patients who underwent elective abdominal colorectal surgical procedures were prospectively randomized to receive or not to receive metoclopramide. Metoclopramide was intravenously administered every 8 hours from the completion of surgery until a solid food diet was able to be tolerated. Seven patients were not included in the final tabulations because of one death, one small bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy, one anastomotic leak requiring laparotomy, and four protocol violations. Ninety-three patients, 37 men and 56 women (mean age, 59.5; range, 14-89 years) underwent 40 segmental colectomies, 13 total abdominal colectomies, 8 abdominoperineal resections, 8 ileoanal pouch procedures, 7 small bowel resections, and 17 other colorectal procedures. The 40 patients who received postoperative metoclopramide were in Group 1, and the 53 who did not were in Group 2. The mean length of time between laparotomy and commencement of oral fluid and oral solid intake in Groups 1 and 2 were 3.5 and 4.8 days, and 3.5 and 5.0 days, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was seen in seven patients in Group 1 and in eight patients in Group 2. These differences were also not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was defined as the need for nasogastric tube reinsertion or discontinuation of oral intake. We conclude that metoclopramide does not significantly alter the course of postoperative ileus. 
Cerebral infarction in young people. A study of 148 patients with early cerebral angiography. The aetiology of strokes was studied in a hospital based series of patients aged up to 40 years with precise clinical and radiological criteria. One hundred and forty five patients (75 males and 73 females) aged five to 40 years with cerebral ischaemia were evaluated. Aetiology was heterogeneous and could be classified into seven groups. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in all cases and indicated the aetiological diagnosis in most patients. Embolism was the most frequent recognised abnormality (38.4%). There were no complications of arteriography. Arterial dissections discovered by arteriography were the cause of the stroke in 10.1% of the patients. Atherosclerosis was diagnosed in 32 cases and was the commonest cause (21.6%). In one fifth of cases no cause was found. Contraceptive drugs were considered as potential cause of ischaemic stroke in 11.5%, cardiac diseases in 12.8% and haematological disorders in 8.1%. Other potential causes included migraine, inflammatory diseases, pregnancy and lacunas. Follow up in 126 cases showed that many patients had good functional recovery. 
Bleeding complications to oral anticoagulant therapy: multivariate analysis of 1010 treatment years in 551 outpatients. One thousand and ten patient years of oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin-K-antagonists were reviewed with regard to major bleeding complications. The incidence of bleeding that necessitated hospital admission was 2.7% per year (95% confidence limits, 1.7-3.7%). The major source of bleeding was the alimentary tract, whereas no cases of intracranial bleeding were found. Various factors with potential effects on the bleeding risk were evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis, and the following independent risk factors were identified: age greater than 75 years and hypertension increased the bleeding risk by 10.5% and 4.5%, respectively. Each recorded prothrombin value significantly below the therapeutic range increased the bleeding risk by 3.9%, and each year of treatment increased the risk by 2.0%. These figures may be used to estimate the risk of major bleeding in an individual patient. Current treatment with thiazide diuretics was found to increase the bleeding risk by 5.2%. However, this observation requires further documentation and analysis. Although no lethal episodes of bleeding occurred, the developing field of indications for oral anticoagulant therapy should be considered on the basis of a continuous substantial risk of major bleeding. 
Malakoplakia of the temporal bone in a nine-month-old infant. A case of malakoplakia, of the temporal bone in a nine-month-old male child is reported. The lesion presented as an aural polyp, associated with a lower motor neuron facial palsy. On exploration, the granuloma was noted to involve the temporal bone, eroding the bony labyrinth. It was successfully treated with surgical debridement, and antibiotics. A review of the relevant literature is presented. 
British Columbia sends patients to Seattle for coronary artery surgery. Bypassing the queue in Canada. Concern about waiting lists for elective procedures has become a highly visible challenge to the universal health insurance program in Canada. In response to lengthening queues for patients waiting for cardiac surgery, British Columbia made contracts with four Seattle hospitals to send a total of 200 patients for coronary artery bypass surgery. This article examines the cause of the queue for cardiac surgery in British Columbia and the events that led to outside contracting. Global hospital budgets and restrictions on capital expansion have limited hospital capacity for cardiac surgery. This constrained supply, combined with periodic shortages in critical care nurses and cardiac perfusion technologists, has resulted in a rapid increase in the waiting list. Reducing wide variations in the lengths of queues for individual surgeons may afford an opportunity to reduce long waits. While the patient queue for cardiac surgery has sparked a public debate about budget limits and health care needs, its clinical impact remains uncertain. 
Double-blind, cross-over study comparing prostaglandin E1 and papaverine in patients with vasculogenic impotence. Intracorporeal injection of vasoactive agents is the treatment of choice for many patients with organic impotence. However, some patients with vasculogenic impotence respond poorly to injections of papaverine or papaverine/phentolamine. This study was conducted to determine if patients with vasculogenic impotence who failed to respond to papaverine might respond to prostaglandin E1 and thus be salvaged from possible prosthetic surgery. A total of 54 patients with vasculogenic impotence were administered intracorporeal prostaglandin E1 (20 micrograms) and intracorporeal papaverine (60 mg) randomized in a double-blind fashion and crossed over one week later. Forty-six percent of patients receiving prostaglandin E1 produced a satisfactory erection compared with 14 percent of patients with a similar response to papaverine. The difference between these results was highly significantly by the McNemar test. The number of side effects were similar for both drugs. Prostaglandin E1 might be considered the intracorporeal agent of choice for patients with significant vasculogenic impotence. 
Hidradenoma papilliferum of the upper eyelid arising from the apocrine gland of Moll. Hidradenoma papilliferum is derived from apocrine sweat glands and was originally described as a tumor located in the anogenital area. The authors recently examined a 78-year-old man with a hidradenoma papilliferum at the margin of the upper eyelid. While the tumor was located in the dermis, serial sections showed a connection to the epidermis and neoplastic cells partially replacing a gland of Moll. There were glandular structures with luminal cells that showed apical decapitation-type secretion, indicating the apocrine origin of the tumor. The luminal cells also contained granules that stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and were diastase resistant. Results of examination of the duct-forming cells by transmission electron microscopy showed adluminal villi, focal decapitation secretion, luminal cytoplasmic debris, and electron-dense cytoplasmic secretory granules. Because the apocrine glands of Moll are localized adjacent to the eyelid cilia, hidradenoma papilliferum and other tumors of apocrine origin should be considered in the clinical setting of a mass at the eyelid margin. 
Reflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver causing biliary obstruction. Treatment by biliary stenting with 5-year follow-up. Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are rare lesions that are becoming increasingly recognized, possibly because of frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography. Most previously reported cases have been treated by hepatic resection. For this reason, we describe a patient with obstructive jaundice secondary to an inflammatory hepatic pseudotumor in the porta hepatis. Bilateral internal biliary stents were inserted, and the patient remains well 5 years later. The clinicopathologic features of inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are described, as are the implications of accurate diagnosis. There have been no previous reports of biliary stenting in management of inflammatory hepatic pseudotumors. 
'Low sodium' diuresis and ileal loss in patients with ileostomies: effect of desmopressin. Patients with ileostomies show an early diuresis when sodium restricted; this, together with an obligatory ileal sodium loss, predisposes them to severe salt and water depletion. The role of arginine vasopressin in this circumstance and whether it is natriuretic, or antinatriuretic, is unclear. There is also controversy over its likely effect on small bowel fluid reabsorption. We have examined the effect of the non-pressor (V2) synthetic vasopressin analogue 1-deamino-8-D-arginine (desmopressin) on renal and ileal sodium and water excretion in ileostomy patients during acute adaptation to a low sodium diet. Patients were studied on two separate occasions (nonrandomised) with and without the administration of desmopressin (0.75 micrograms intramuscular, three times a day). In eight subjects without desmopressin there was pronounced diuresis on the first low sodium day, associated with a fall in renal sodium excretion and no change in ileal output or composition. In five (of the original) subjects with desmopressin there was pronounced antidiuresis, no change in renal sodium excretion, and no change in ileal output or composition. In both studies rises in plasma renin activity and salivary aldosterone concentration lagged behind the early decline in renal sodium excretion. We have confirmed the phenomenon of 'low sodium' diuresis after sodium restriction in ileostomy patients and shown that it can be prevented by desmopressin. Desmopressin has no direct or indirect effect on renal sodium excretion or ileal fluid and electrolyte loss in humans. 
Otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux. The exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is unknown, although it is estimated that at least 25% of patients with GER have head and neck symptoms alone. These symptoms may consist of one or more of the following: excess salivation, hoarseness, "post-nasal drip," voice change, persistent coughing, food sticking in the throat, globus hystericus, otalgia, throat clearing, neck pain, sore throats, the sensation of a lump in the throat, choking spells, and bronchospasm. Carcinoma of the larynx and upper aerodigestive tract may be a consequence of chronic reflux. GER, especially when the classic symptoms of reflux are absent, is frequently overlooked as a cause of these problems. This article reviews the symptoms and pathophysiology of these conditions. The diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available to us in managing these patients are also discussed. 
Diagnostic accuracy of temporomandibular joint lower-compartment arthroscopy using an ultrathin arthroscope: a postmortem study. Arthroscopy was performed on the lower temporomandibular (TMJ) joint compartment of 30 fresh cadavers using a newly developed ultrathin arthroscope. Comparison of arthroscopic and dissection findings showed a diagnostic accuracy of 57%. There were both false-positive and false-negative arthroscopic diagnosis. The majority of the false diagnosis occurred in the lateral part of the joint. Iatrogenic damage to the disc occurred in one joint. The study suggests that arthroscopy of the lower joint space of the TMJ can be done with a diagnostic accuracy similar to what has been described for the upper joint space. There appears to be no major risks of iatrogenic damage to the joint structures using an ultrathin arthroscope. 
Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with sucralfate: a review. Sucralfate has been used widely for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Healing rates for duodenal ulcer range from 60 to 90% at 4-6 weeks and up to 90% at 12 weeks for gastric ulcer. The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists. There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations. 
Bowel obstruction: evaluation with CT Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated. A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction. Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass. 
Prevalence of HIV antibody in a noninner-city university hospital emergency department. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: To determine the prevalence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in trauma and nontrauma patients not identified as having known HIV infection in a noninner-city university teaching hospital emergency department, and to determine the frequency with which treating emergency physicians are knowledgeable of patients' risk factors for HIV infection. POPULATION: ED patients between 18 and 59 years old with injuries that met trauma center triage criteria or with nontrauma-related illness who had blood drawn for physician-requested laboratory tests and for whom an extra aliquot of blood was available for HIV antibody testing. METHODS: All serum samples were first tested for antibody to HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. If positive, the specimen was retested. All repeatedly reactive specimens were analyzed by Western blot test. The treating physician completed a questionnaire regarding the patient's illness and risk factors for HIV infection after the patient's care was completed. RESULTS: Two of 100 major trauma patients (confidence interval, 0% to 5%) and seven of 100 nontrauma patients (confidence interval, 2% to 12%) had antibody to HIV. The seropositive rate by age and clinical group varied from 0% to 12.5%, with the highest rates in the 30- to 39-year-old group of nontrauma patients. The difference in proportions of seropositivity between the sexes was not statistically significant. Physicians obtained information regarding homosexual or bisexual behavior, IV drug use, and hemophilia from 52% of the nontrauma patients and only 17% of trauma patients. None of 30 trauma patients for whom data were available and only two of the 100 nontrauma patients gave a history of any high-risk behavior. CONCLUSION: Although the sampling technique we used has limitations, the prevalence of HIV infection in our noninner-city ED is similar to that recently reported from inner-city EDs. This is in contrast to previous reports of low rates of HIV infection among ED patients in nonurban settings. Physician assessment of risk factors was incomplete in the majority of our patients. Patients rarely acknowledged any high-risk behavior. It is essential that emergency health care workers take maximum diligence to prevent exposure to blood and other body fluids from all ED patients. 
Immune dysfunction in mice with plasmacytomas. I. Evidence that transforming growth factor-beta contributes to the altered expression of activation receptors on host B lymphocytes. Plasmacytoma-bearing mice (PC-mice) develop a polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by marked impairment of: a) primary antibody responses and b) proliferative responses to B cell mitogens. The present investigations used two-color flow cytometry to examine B lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes of PC-mice and found decreased surface membrane expression of surface IgM (sIgM), transferrin receptors (TfR) and IgE FcR (CD23), increased expression of class II MHC, but normal expression of B220, Mel-14, Fc gamma RII, and Fc mu R. These changes were not related to the H chain class or the amount of Ig produced by the plasmacytoma. When cultured with IL-4, B lymphocytes from PC-mice increased their expression of sIgM and class II MHC, but not of CD23. Several findings implicate transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the mechanism that modulates receptor expression on B lymphocytes in PC-mice: a) ascites fluid from PC-mice contains large quantities of TGF-beta 1; b) supernatants of cultured spleen cells from PC mice contain up to eightfold more TGF-beta than is found with normal spleen cells; c) cloned plasmacytoma cells produce TGF-beta in vitro; and d) the abnormal phenotype of B cells from PC-mice, i.e., decreased CD23, sIgM, and TfR, and increased class II MHC, is induced on normal B cells cultured in the presence of TGF-beta 1. Because sIgM, TfR, class II MHC, and CD23 are molecules that play fundamental roles in the activation of normal B cells, their modulation by TGF-beta 1: a) identifies molecular mechanisms that could account for some of the known immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta 1 and b) implicates TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency that is characteristic of plasma cell tumors. 
Endoscopic removal of inflammatory fibroid polyps of the stomach. Three cases of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp removed by endoscopic polypectomy are reported. All lesions were located in the gastric antrum or prepyloric region, and their depth was restricted to the submucosa. The correct diagnosis was obtained, and the digestive symptoms disappeared after polypectomy. In contrast to observations in previous reports, we believe these lesions are suitable for removal by endoscopic means, provided they are small in size and strictly submucosal in location. 
Peptic ulcer disease in children. Primary duodenal ulcer disease occurs in children of all ages, but is most often seen in those over 10 years. As in the adult, it often pursues a chronic course. Primary gastric ulcer is seen in children under 6 years, is more unusual, and does not tend to recur. Stress ulcers are seen most often in infants and in critically ill children and are asymptomatic until the complications of hemorrhage or perforation appear. Drug-related ulcers are being seen more frequently as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents increases. With the use of new therapeutic agents, management has been simplified and surgical intervention has become a rarity. Helicobacter pylori is now a recognized cause of antral gastritis and ulceration in the child. 
Formation of noninfectious HIV-1 virus particles lacking a full-length envelope protein. Deletions were constructed within a functional human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral clone in order to assess the role of the envelope protein in virus particle formation. A graded exonuclease deletion technique was used to produce 12 clones with deletions of 175-308 nucleotides in the first conserved domain of envelope. This included 9 clones with frameshift deletions and 3 clones with in-frame deletions. Isogenic pairs of env deletion clones were produced with or without an additional deletion in the vif and vpr genes. Upon transfection, all clones produced virus particles, as determined by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and sucrose gradient assays with conditioned media. Virus particles produced from clones with deletions in env or vif and vpr, or both regions, banded on sucrose gradients with a mobility similar to that of virus produced by the parental clone. The p24 gag capsid protein in the particles was resistant to trypsin, but the particles were disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100, suggesting the presence of a surrounding lipid bilayer. Furthermore, electron microscopic studies revealed both mature and immature virus particles derived from COS cells transfected with the env deletion clones. Cocultivation experiments with lymphoid cells and cells transfected with each of the env deletion clones demonstrated that the virus particles were noninfectious. 
Ribose facilitates thallium-201 redistribution in patients with coronary artery disease To investigate whether i.v. infusion of ribose, an adenine nucleotide precursor, postischemia facilitates thallium-201 (201Tl) redistribution and improves identification of ischemic myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 17 patients underwent two exercise 201Tl stress tests, performed 1-2 wk apart. After immediate postexercise planar imaging, patients received either i.v. ribose (3.3 mg/kg/min x 30 min) or saline as a control. Additional imaging was performed 1 and 4 hr postexercise. Reversible defects were identified by count-profile analysis. Significantly more (nearly twice as many) reversible 201Tl defects were identified on the post-ribose images compared to the post-saline (control) images at both 1 and 4 hr postexercise (p less than 0.001). Quantitative analyses of the coronary arteriogram was available in 13 patients and confirmed that the additional reversible defects were in myocardial regions supplied by stenosed arteries. We conclude that ribose appears to facilitate 201Tl redistribution in patients with CAD and enhances identification of ischemic myocardium. 
Gastric emptying and interdigestive antroduodenal motility in patients with esophageal scleroderma. The study was carried out on two groups of patients with esophageal scleroderma (LES pressure less than 5 mm Hg and amplitude of smooth muscle pressure waves less than 10 mm Hg): one group included patients with mild (group M) and the other severe (group S) gastroesophageal reflux (GER) diagnosed by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Nine normal subjects were used as controls. Antroduodenal motility was recorded by means of manometry for 200-300 min after an overnight fast and the gastric emptying (T1/2) of a semisolid meal was measured utilizing a scintigraphic method. Patients of group S showed a significantly lower incidence of migrating motor complex activity fronts, as well as a more delayed gastric emptying, compared with those of group M. The reason that patients with the same degree of esophageal motor impairment have different degrees of GER may lie in the fact that the concomitant impairment of gastrointestinal interdigestive cyclic clearing activity and the delay in gastric emptying may allow a larger quantity of material to remain stagnant in the gastric lumen, readily available for gastroesophageal reflux. 
Impaired diastolic function and coronary reserve in genetic hypertension. Role of interstitial fibrosis and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with genetic hypertension is accompanied by abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness and impaired coronary reserve. Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve. 
Time course of the blood pressure response to oral isradipine in uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Forty-five patients with supine diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) above 95 mm Hg at the end of a four-week placebo run-in period were randomized to receive either 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg isradipine twice daily as monotherapy for 12 weeks. Blood pressures (BP) were measured every 14 days, always by the same observer and using standard techniques. The Montevideo Mathematical Model was used to determine the time course of the response to treatment in each dosage group. Of the 33 patients who completed the study, four of the 12 patients receiving 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily had their BP controlled by weeks 10 or 12 (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), seven of 11 by 2.5 mg twice daily, and five of 10 by 5 mg twice daily. Mean DBPs for each dosage group were significantly reduced by week 12 (P less than .015 in all groups). The Montevideo Model allows estimation of the time after onset of treatment by which BP is reduced by a given amount. This model indicated that, with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily, a fall in mean arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg is to be expected within three weeks of initiating drug administration. 
Clinical studies of sucralfate in reflux esophagitis. The European experience. Reflux esophagitis is encountered quite frequently in clinical practice. Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe and complications can occur, particularly if the disorder is untreated or undertreated. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, healing lesions, and preventing complications. Various pharmacologic options are available for treatment, including antacids, alginate/antacid compounds, acid-reducing agents, prokinetic drugs, and agents that protect the mucosa. This article reviews a number of clinical studies evaluating sucralfate in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. Almost all of the investigations were conducted in Europe and encompassed open-label studies, placebo-controlled trials, and comparative studies. From the studies discussed, it can be concluded that sucralfate not only has a place in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, but is also effective in treating reflux esophagitis. Sucralfate is comparable to H2-receptor antagonists in symptom improvement and healing rates. In addition, the studies reviewed have shown sucralfate to be safe and well tolerated. 
Accumulation of glycoprotein in the Golgi apparatus of hepatocytes in alcoholic liver injuries. To clarify the role of the hepatocytic Golgi apparatus in the accumulation of proteins in the hepatocytes of alcoholic liver disease, changes in the Golgi apparatus in human and experimental alcoholic liver injuries were analyzed. Immunoelectron microscopically, transferrin, one of the secretory glycoproteins from the liver, was retained in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the hepatocytes in both human and rat alcoholic liver injuries. Biochemically, transferrin content in the Golgi fraction was clearly high in the rats with alcoholic liver injury. Desialo-glycoproteins were found in the serum of rats with alcoholic liver injuries. These results suggested that the glycosylation and secretion of hepatic glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus were impaired in alcoholic liver injury. These abnormalities in the Golgi apparatus function may be important for the development of alcoholic liver injury. 
An autopsy study of the peritoneal cavity from patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Sixteen autopsies were performed on patients aged 56 +/- 15 (SD) years who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 834 +/- 766 (SD) days. Lactate-buffered dialysate and povidone-iodine antiseptic were used in all cases. Multiple peritoneal sections were taken to evaluate peritoneal membrane thickening, inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and adhesions. Peritoneal thickening, inflammation, or adhesions were not related to sex, race, or etiology of renal failure. Time on dialysis was also not a direct determinant of peritoneal adhesions or neovascularization. Peritonitis episodes correlated with chronic peritoneal serosal changes. This study supports the hypothesis that peritoneal alterations in patients on CAPD are related to episodes of peritonitis. 
The prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumor in ependymoma. Between 1970 and 1989, 29 patients with intracranial ependymomas were evaluated and treated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. With a median follow-up of 82 months, the actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 61 +/- 10% and 46 +/- 12%, respectively. Anaplastic histological findings were uncommon (2 of 29). Initial postoperative radiotherapy was given to 25 patients, with a median tumor dose of 5360 cGy. With a median time to recurrence of 22 months, local failure (within 2 cm of original enhancing mass) was the predominant pattern of relapse (15 of 16 failures). The presence of radiographic residual disease seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans was the most important prognostic variable for patients with intracranial ependymoma. Analysis of the 19 patients who underwent postoperative imaging revealed a 75 +/- 15% 5-year freedom from progressive disease for 9 patients with no residual disease, as compared with 0% freedom from progressive disease for the 10 patients with gross residual disease (P = 0.03). In contrast, the surgical assessment of residual disease was not significant (P = 0.4). Age at presentation was also a significant prognostic factor. The overall actuarial survival rate at 12 years for infants 24 months or younger at diagnosis was 0%, as compared with 62 +/- 13% for older patients (P = 0.03). For non-anaplastic ependymomas, complete surgical resection followed by local-field, high-dose (greater than 54 Gy) radiotherapy appears to offer the greatest chance for long-term survival. Because of the markedly reduced survival rate for patients with radiologically apparent postoperative disease, maximal surgical resection and novel therapeutic endeavors appear warranted for this high-risk group. Future protocols should use postoperative imaging, not operative reports, to stratify patients with ependymoma. 
The course of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease usually has periodic exacerbations and remissions. Pain can disappear without total healing of the ulcer crater and can be absent when an ulcer is present. Changes in the incidence of ulcer disease have been noted in recent years. Genetic predisposition, infection with H. pylori, and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs are involved in causation. Stress; the use of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine; and other diseases have been implicated as etiologic factors. Ulcer pain has a recognizable pattern, but the symptoms can be variable, particularly in older people and in patients taking ulcerogenic medications. The familiar complications of hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction still occur, and nonulcer dyspepsia has not been fully explained. Duodenal ulcers have a disturbing tendency to return; new therapeutic approaches offer hope. 
Comparative study of glass and antimony electrodes for continuous oesophageal pH monitoring. Oesophageal pH monitoring data are influenced by numerous patient or technique related factors, or both. In this study, data recorded with glass microelectrodes or antimony electrodes, both with external cutaneous Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, connected to two different recording devices are compared. Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH less than 4) ranged from poor to excellent (0.55 to 1.00). Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r:0.93 to 1.00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0.90). Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor (0.55 to 0.70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes. The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes. 
Combined treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Twenty-four patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones (12 radiolucent and 12 calcified) were treated by a combined approach of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and subsequent instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The patients received a mean of 1500 +/- 185 shock-wave discharges. The mean instillation time of MTBE was 13 +/- 4.2 hr. Treatment was tolerated without major adverse effects. Within a time period of three to five days eight of 12 patients with pure radiolucent stones and four of 12 with calcified stones became stone-free. After a median follow-up of five months (range: one week to 26 months), a total of 11 patients (92%) with radiolucent stones and of eight patients (66%) of those with calcified stones were free of stones, fragments, or debris. These clearance rates appear high when compared with reports on monotherapy with ESWL or MTBE, suggesting a positive effect of a combined approach in selected patients. Two patients exhibited recurrent stones after six and seven months, respectively. 
Cytopathologic diagnosis of benign lesions simulating choroidal melanomas. In three cases of benign pigmented lesions (one melanocytoma and two pigment epithelial adenomas) there was evidence of tumor growth and the lesions were referred to us as uveal melanomas. The fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens were correctly interpreted in the operating room as being benign tumors. The pigment granules in these benign pigmented lesions are much larger than are observed in uveal melanomas. When they were visible through the heavy pigmentation, the cellular detail appeared benign. In two cases the tumors were successfully resected with cyclochroidectomy techniques and the visual outcome was good. The third eye was studied after it had been removed at another institution. Fine needle aspiration biopsy can often differentiate a benign-simulating pigmented lesion from uveal melanoma. 
Insights into the mechanisms of defective antigen presentation after hemorrhage. Although hemorrhage depresses macrophage antigen presentation (AP), a critical component in eliciting an antigen-specific immune response, it is not known which particular step in macrophage AP (i.e., uptake, ingestion, catabolism, or presentation of degraded antigens to T cells) is defective. To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to an arterial mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then adequately resuscitated. Peritoneal and splenic macrophage cultures were prepared 2 and 24 hours after hemorrhage. Macrophage AP capacity was measured by coculturing macrophages with the T-helper cell clone D10.G4.1. To gain information about macrophage ability to digest the specific antigen conalbumin, lysosomal activity was bypassed by use of chemically denatured conalbumin peptides. To study macrophage ability to present conalbumin peptides, macrophages were fixed and D10.G4.1 proliferation in response to fragmented conalbumin was determined. AP of native conalbumin by peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages was depressed (p less than 0.05) by 50% (peritoneal macrophages) and 55% (splenic macrophages) 2 hours and 57% (peritoneal macrophages) and 35% (splenic macrophages) 24 hours after hemorrhage. In contrast, presentation of conalbumin peptides was only slightly decreased. In addition, the ability of fixed peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages to present conalbumin peptides was similar in hemorrhaged and sham mice. Because bypassing of macrophage lysosomal activity with degraded native antigens prevented the suppression of AP, the results suggest that hemorrhage-induced suppression of AP is not caused by a reduced macrophage capacity to present antigenic peptides but by decreased antigen catabolism by macrophages. 
An improved palpebral spring for the management of paralytic lagophthalmos. Facial nerve paralysis with orbicularis muscle palsy can result in serious corneal complications, such as exposure, ulceration, and perforation. Eyelid springs have been used for patients with orbicularis muscle palsy to provide corneal protection while maintaining vision by restoring some kinetic eyelid function. The authors report on 24 patients with facial nerve paralysis who underwent implantation of an eyelid spring over a period of 8 years. The most common cause of orbicularis muscle paralysis was acoustic neuroma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Eighty-three percent of the cases successfully regained and maintained their eyelid function during the follow-up period, averaging 3.0 years. We have modified the spring to allow permanent attachment to the orbital rim by wiring. This modification of the surgical technique has minimized the most common postoperative complication: loosening of the spring from its periosteal attachment with subsequent loss of function and extrusion. In addition, transcutaneous adjustments of the spring now can be made without an incision using clasp-adjusting dental pliers. In selected patients, the placement of an eyelid spring prevents the corneal complications associated with paralytic lagophthalmos while maintaining visual function. 
Adenosine use during pregnancy. Adenosine is a naturally occurring endogenous nucleoside that suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction time, terminates supraventricular tachycardia, and restores sinus rhythm. Its use has been reported in children and adults but not in pregnant patients. This case documents the successful termination of a supraventricular tachycardia in a 39-week pregnant hypotensive patient. Emergency physicians may wish to consider adenosine use in pregnant patients needing emergency therapy or when conventional therapy fails. 
Cloning of the gene for a human dopamine D4 receptor with high affinity for the antipsychotic clozapine. Dopamine receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. On the basis of the homology between these receptors, three different dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3) have been cloned. Dopamine receptors are primary targets for drugs used in the treatment of psychomotor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. In the management of socially withdrawn and treatment-resistant schizophrenics, clozapine is one of the most favoured antipsychotics because it does not cause tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine, however, has dissociation constants for binding to D2 and D3 that are 4 to 30 times the therapeutic free concentration of clozapine in plasma water. This observation suggests the existence of other types of dopamine receptors which are more sensitive to clozapine. Here we report the cloning of a gene that encodes such a receptor (D4). The D4 receptor gene has high homology to the human dopamine D2 and D3 receptor genes. The pharmacological characteristics of this receptor resembles that of the D2 and D3 receptors, but its affinity for clozapine is one order of magnitude higher. Recognition and characterization of this clozapine neuroleptic site may prove useful in the design of new types of drugs. 
Unproven methods of cancer management. Laetrile. "Laetrile" is used interchangeably with "amygdalin" to designate natural substances, derived primarily from apricots and almonds, that can release cyanide, which is lethal to living organisms. In the 1920s, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Sr., formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells. His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates. In light of the lack of efficacy of Laetrile and its demonstrated ability to cause harm, Laetrile should not be used to treat cancer. 
Pain characterization in cancer patients and the analgetic response to epidural morphine. In 48 patients with pain related to malignancy, a pain characterization was performed during oral opioid therapy. After an optimal epidural morphine regimen had been established, the alteration in pain relief was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization. 
Abnormal guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in MVP dysautonomia: evidence from reconstitution of Gs. We and others have used the term MVP dysautonomia for a particular subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients. The role of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in this dysautonomia was studied by cholate extraction of Gs from erythrocytes from 11 normal subjects and 14 symptomatic dysautonomic patients and reconstitution into cyc-S49 lymphoma membranes, which have normal receptor and adenylyl cyclase but lack Gs. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the dysautonomia group was increased compared to that in controls [3.66 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SE; n = 14) vs. 2.87 +/- 0.14 (n = 11) U cyc- reconstituted activity/mg erythrocyte protein; P less than 0.05]. beta-Adrenergic receptor high affinity state formation was greatest in the severely symptomatic group [KL/KH: severe symptoms, 130 +/- 48 (n = 6); mild symptoms, 33 +/- 7 (n = 7); control, 27 +/- 6 (n = 11); severe dysautonomia distinct, P less than 0.017]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylated G-proteins yielded no gross distinction between severely symptomatic and control groups. This subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients, thus, has supercoupled beta 2-adrenergic receptors (increase in both agonist binding and cyclase activation) conferred by an abnormal Gs, whose effects on agonist binding reflect the severity of illness. 
Diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold in patients with stress-induced ischemia BACKGROUND. To evaluate the relevance of diastolic perfusion time on the mechanisms underlying stress-induced ischemia, 16 patients with coronary artery disease and seven patients with syndrome X underwent five randomized stress tests (upright and supine exercise with and without therapy, transesophageal atrial pacing). METHODS AND RESULTS. Exercise duration Time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression, heart rate, rate-pressure product, and diastolic perfusion time were evaluated for each patient during stress tests. In both groups, variability coefficients of the above-mentioned parameters were not different at rest. At ischemic threshold (0.1 mV ST segment depression) in patients with coronary artery disease, the variability coefficient of exercise duration (40.1 +/- 22.2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than those of heart rate (12.8 +/- 2.9), rate-pressure product (14.8 +/- 3.3), and diastolic perfusion time (0.39 +/- 0.1). The variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time was also significantly (p less than 0.0001) lower than those of heart rate and rate-pressure product. Similarly, the variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time (0.44 +/- 0.1) in syndrome X patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) than those of exercise duration (28.2 +/- 9.4), heart rate (12 +/- 1.4), and rate-pressure product (14.6 +/- 1.3). CONCLUSIONS. Fixed diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold, despite different kinds of stress tests and variability of heart rate and rate-pressure product, indicates the relevant role of diastolic perfusion time in determining myocardial ischemia. 
Comparison of coronary and myocardial morphologic findings in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy during fatal first acute myocardial infarction. The TIMI Investigators. The hearts of 61 patients (39 men aged 64 +/- 11 years) who died from 5 hours to 42 days (median 3 days) after a fatal first acute myocardial infarction without having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery were studied to compare clinical and cardiac morphologic features of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) to those not receiving thrombolytic therapy. Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi. Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045). 
Testicular abscess caused by Salmonella typhi. This case, which we believe is the first report of a bacteriologically proven infection of the testis by Salmonella typhi, illustrates the occurrence of this complication in the convalescent phase of typhoid fever and the absence of a clinically evident preceding bacteremic phase. The case also emphasizes the need for prolonged antibiotic therapy and the role of surgery in treatment of relapses. 
Involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, thought by some to be associated with tumor formation of retinoblastoma as a recessive human oncogene, was investigated in 57 cases using DNA and RNA from primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors. 
Neuroanatomy in fragile X females: the posterior fossa. The relative homogeneity of the neuropsychiatric phenotype in individuals with fragile (fra) X syndrome suggests that there are consistent central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities underlying the observed cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. In this study, the neuroanatomy of the posterior fossa and other selected CNS regions in 12 young fra X females were compared with those of a group of 12 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched females without evidence of the fra X syndrome. Fra X females were shown to have decreased size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and increased size of the fourth ventricle, findings that are identical to those previously reported for fra X males. When compared with fra X male and nonfra X control groups, the distribution of the posterior-vermis and fourth-ventricle variables for the fra X female group was intermediate. These results support the hypothesis that the fra X genetic abnormality leads to hypoplasia of the posterior cerebellar vermis, a neuroanatomical variation of potential importance to both developmental and neuropsychiatric syndromes. 
Multihormonal regulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells: the dominant role of insulin. Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and the abundance of hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA are increased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats and are regulated in accordance with insulin and metabolic status. We recently purified rat IGFBP-1 from medium conditioned by well differentiated rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. Since this cell line provides a useful model for examining the effects of hormones on hepatocellular function, we used H4IIE cells to examine the relative role that insulin and other factors may play in the regulation of IGFBP-1 production. H4IIE cells were stabilized in serum-free medium, then treated with specific hormones. The availability of IGFBPs in conditioned medium was estimated by [125I]IGF-I binding assay, and specific BPs were assessed by Western ligand and immunoblot analyses. The abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA was determined by Northern and slot blot analysis. Initial studies revealed that [125I]IGF-I-binding activity in conditioned medium was reduced after 24-h incubation with 100 nM insulin (52 +/- 4% of control; P less than 0.001). In contrast, binding activity was increased after only 4 h of incubation with 75 microM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) or 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001 vs. control for each), but these effects were prevented by insulin. Ligand and immunoblotting demonstrated that insulin decreased the production of 32K and 34K forms of IGFBP-1, while both 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone increased the production of IGFBP-1; again, insulin prevented the effects of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. Of note, 1 microM rat GH, testosterone, progesterone, or 17 beta-estradiol had no effect on either IGF-binding activity or IGFBP-1 production. Northern and slot blot analyses revealed that 100 nM insulin profoundly lowered the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA in H4IIE cells (4 +/- 0.6% of control at 4 h; P less than 0.001), while IGFBP-1 mRNA was increased 2-fold during incubation with 75 microM 8-CPT-cAMP (P less than 0.001) and 9-fold with 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001). Once again, the effect of insulin was dominant; insulin both prevented and reversed the effects of maximally effective concentrations of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. To determine whether this effect of insulin reflected altered generation or stability of IGFBP-1 mRNA, H4IIE cells were incubated with 2.5 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D with or without insulin, and mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Survival of DNA HLA-DR typed and matched cadaver kidney transplants. The Collaborative Transplant Study. The clinical value of serological HLA matching for cadaver kidney transplantation remains uncertain because the success rate for HLA-matched cadaver transplants is lower than that of HLA-matched sibling grafts. Up to 25% of serological HLA-DR typings may be incorrect when compared with a more accurate DNA-RFLP method, and we have now examined whether incorrect HLA-DR typings account for the lower than expected success rates of HLA-matched cadaver transplants. 58 transplant centres took part in this study and DNA was extracted from over 4000 samples of frozen tissue at the study centre. 8 laboratories then completed blind RFLP typing for HLA-DR. Serological typing data were reported by individual transplant laboratories. 29 of 107 transplants (27%) that were reported as HLA A, B, DR compatible and 76 of 273 (28%) transplants that were reported as HLA B, DR compatible according to serological typing were found to be HLA-DR mismatched by DNA typing. The one-year transplant success rate for DNA-matched HLA, A, B, DR grafts was 87% compared with 69% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.02); the corresponding success rate for DNA-matched HLA B, DR grafts was 85% compared with 72% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.01). Many transplants that were previously thought to be HLA matched are mismatched, and this finding may account for previously unexplained graft failures. 
Oestrogen and androgen states in oligo-amenorrhoeic women with polycystic ovaries. Oestrogen and androgen states have been studied in relation to ovarian morphology defined by ultrasonography in 65 women with oligo-amenorrhoea. Of the 48 women with polycystic ovaries (PCO), 44 (92%) had a withdrawal bleed following progestogen challenge (indicating oestrogenization) compared with just three (18%) of the 17 with non-PCO (P less than 0.001). Median serum concentrations of oestradiol and oestrone were statistically significantly higher in the PCO group but the ranges overlapped widely. Of the four women with PCO but oestrogen deficiency, two were hirsute and had evidence of a severe form of the disorder. The other two were not hirsute and appeared to have hypothalamic dysfunction associated with weight loss overriding the disorder due to pre-existing PCO. Compared with the non-PCO group, the PCO subgroup without hirsutism (n = 31) had statistically significantly higher median values of LH, testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentrations, and free androgen index. Concentrations of androgen, but not LH, were significantly higher still in the PCO subgroup with hirsutism (n = 17). 
Nonpalpable breast lesions: stereotactic automated large-core biopsies. One hundred two patients with mammographically suspicious, nonpalpable lesions underwent stereotactic breast biopsy with a biopsy gun and an automated 14-gauge cutting needle. After biopsy, a localization wire was placed and surgical biopsy performed. There was agreement of the histologic results from the gun biopsy and the surgical biopsy specimens in 98 cases (96%), including 22 of 23 carcinomas (96%) (kappa = 0.936). The gun biopsy yielded findings that led to the correct diagnosis in two cases involving lesions that were missed at surgical biopsy; two lesions found at surgery were missed at gun biopsy. The results of this study suggest that the use of 14-gauge needles improves agreement between surgical and needle core biopsy findings and that stereotactic biopsy with an automated needle and gun can be an acceptable alternative to surgical biopsy in women with mammographically suspicious breast lesions. 
The perception of angina in diabetes: relation to somatic pain threshold and autonomic function. Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise. Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy. Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold. Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry. The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility. Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold. The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds. In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group. 
Systolic ejection murmurs in the elderly: aortic valve and carotid arteries echo-Doppler findings. Two-dimensional echographic and color Doppler studies of the heart and carotid arteries (CA) were performed in 45 patients greater than sixty-five years old without aortic stenosis, 23 with (Group 1) and 22 without (group 2) precordial ejection systolic murmur (SM). Aortic cusps thickening was found in 11 Group 1 (48%) and 2 Group 2 (9%) patients (p less than 0.001). Aortic root and aortic arch size were similar in the two groups. Maximum aortic flow velocity was significantly greater in Group 1 (200 60 cm/sec) than in Group 2 (120 20 cm/sec) (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular outflow systolic maximum velocity was similar in the two groups. A bilateral neck murmur was heard in 10/23 Group 1 patients (43%); in this group, patients with cervical SM had a greater maximum aortic flow velocity than those without cervical SM (230 + 60 cm/sec vs 172 + 32 cm/sec, p less than 0.001). In Group 1, 3 patients had a cervical SM louder on one neck side; only in these 3 patients were ipsilateral obstructive CA plaques found. A unilateral neck SM was heard in 4/22 Group 2 patients (18%); in these 4, ipsilateral obstructive CA were found. Conclusions: (1) in the elderly, precordial ejection SM is related to mild increase in maximum aortic flow velocity and thickening of aortic cusps; (2) in patients with precordial SM radiated to both neck sides, maximum aortic flow velocity tends to be more markedly increased; (3) in patients with precordial SM, a cervical SM louder on one neck side should suggest coexistent ipsilateral CA stenosis. 
I-TevI, the endonuclease encoded by the mobile td intron, recognizes binding and cleavage domains on its DNA target. Mobility of the phage T4 td intron depends on activity of an intron-encoded endonuclease (I-TevI), which cleaves a homologous intronless (delta In) target gene. The double-strand break initiates a recombination event that leads to intron transfer. We found previously that I-TevI cleaves td delta In target DNA 23-26 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site. DNase I-footprinting experiments and gel-shift assays indicate that I-TevI makes primary contacts around the intron insertion site. A synthetic DNA duplex spanning the insertion site but lacking the cleavage site was shown to bind I-TevI specifically, and when cloned, to direct cleavage into vector sequences. The behavior of the cloned duplex and that of deletion and insertion mutants support a primary role for sequences surrounding the insertion site in directing I-TevI binding, conferring cleavage ability, and determining cleavage polarity. On the other hand, sequences around the cleavage site were shown to influence cleavage efficiency and cut-site selection. The role of cleavage-site sequences in determining cleavage distance argues against a strict "ruler" mechanism for cleavage by I-TevI. The complex nature of the homing site recognized by this unusual type of endonuclease is considered in the context of intron spread. 
Neobladder construction using completely detubularized sigmoid colon after radical cystoprostatectomy. To improve the quality of life of the patient we used completely detubularized sigmoid colon for bladder reconstruction along with radical cystoprostatectomy in 6 men with invasive bladder cancer. Followup was 8 to 20 months. Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry. Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis. However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients. Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm. water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm. water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.). The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml. per second). There was no reflux in any patient. One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis. The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life. In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy. 
Entrapment of a cat in a new-style pet food container. Although many regulations exist to protect human consumers from hazardous products, there are no comparable safeguards for products intended for pet use. The authors describe a case in which a new-style cat food container presented a hazard to pets. 
Fetal supraventricular tachycardia and hydrops fetalis: combined intensive, direct, and transplacental therapy. A 25-week fetus with severe hydrops fetalis secondary to supraventricular tachycardia was treated with fetal intramuscular injections of digoxin in conjunction with maternal intravenous digoxin, followed by oral digoxin and subsequently by oral procainamide therapy. Fetal umbilical blood sampling revealed poor placental transfer of digoxin, even after 2 weeks of therapeutic maternal levels. This case suggests that direct fetal therapy is of value in the treatment of some fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia, and lends further evidence that the role of transplacental digoxin therapy is limited in the compromised fetus. It also demonstrates that resolution of hydrops may require a prolonged period. 
Superiority of granisetron to dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Trials of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists have shown excellent antiemetic activity for chemotherapy containing cisplatin when compared with high-dose metoclopramide. There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations). During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis. There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events. We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents. 
The Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure: anatomical determinants and modifications. Seven of 119 patients undergoing anatomical correction for transposition of the great arteries and Taussig-Bing anomalies without pulmonary stenosis had the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure and the rest, the arterial switch. The age of the patients having the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure ranged from 0.5 year to 5 years (mean age, 2.2 +/- 1 years). Four patients had transposition, 2 had Taussig-Bing anomaly, and 1 had corrected transposition. Indications for the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure were side-by-side great arteries associated with difficult coronary anatomy (5 patients), single coronary system (1 patient), and subaortic stenosis (1). A graft between the ascending and descending aorta for interrupted aortic arch made mobilization and posterior displacement of the ascending aorta for the arterial switch difficult. Subaortic stenosis (1 patient), subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (2 patients), and restrictive ventricular septal defect (4) precluded the Rastelli procedure. In 6 patients, the main pulmonary artery was transected at the band, a proximal main pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis was complemented with a synthetic patch, and a right ventricle to distal main pulmonary artery valved conduit was inserted. Four patients had closure of the aortic outflow. Two patients had postoperative bleeding and 2, heart block. The only patient who did not have transection of the main pulmonary artery, an omission that led to an obstructed conduit at the distal anastomosis, died late. Two patients subsequently needed aortic outflow closure for critical aortic insufficiency. The Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure has a definite role and can be safely performed in patients with transposition of the great arteries and Taussig-Bing anomalies. 
Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) reduces restenosis after iliac angioplasty in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is central to the process of restenosis. Attempts to inhibit the events leading to this proliferation have met with little success. In addition to its known antithrombotic effects, heparin also has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. These effects appear to be unrelated to its anticoagulant properties and are retained in low molecular weight heparin derivatives. Although the use of heparin for as long as 18 to 24 h after coronary angioplasty in humans has not prevented restenosis, longer treatment periods have not been assessed. This study examines the effect of treatment with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit iliac artery model. Control rabbits had a mean iliac artery diameter of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mm, which increased to 1.73 +/- 0.09 mm after balloon angioplasty. At follow-up angiography 4 weeks later, the mean vessel diameter was 0.56 +/- 0.12 mm. Animals treated with low dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks and high dose enoxaparin (10 mg/kg per day) for either 2 or 4 weeks had similar mean luminal diameters before and immediately after angioplasty. At follow-up angiography, the mean luminal diameter was 0.82 +/- 0.17 mm for low dose enoxaparin, 1.04 +/- 0.20 mm for 2 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.03 versus control) and 1.19 +/- 0.09 mm for 4 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.001 versus control). When defined as loss of 50% of the initial gain achieved with angioplasty, restenosis was found in all control vessels. 
Post-herpetic neuralgia: further post-mortem studies of cases with and without pain. The pathological features associated with post-herpetic neuralgia require further study. We report here 5 cases, 3 with severe post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and 2 with no persistent pain. The findings of dorsal horn atrophy and cell, axon and myelin loss with fibrosis in the sensory ganglion were found only in patients with persistent pain. Marked loss of myelin and axons in the nerve and/or sensory root were found in cases with and without pain. Some evidence is presented for a more generalized subacute or chronic inflammatory process which may explain the clinical features of some patients. Further studies will be necessary to fully describe the morbid anatomy of this disorder. 
Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. 
High energy neutron treatment for pelvic cancers: study stopped because of increased mortality. OBJECTIVE--To compare high energy fast neutron treatment with conventional megavoltage x ray treatment in the management of locally advanced pelvic carcinomas (of the cervix, bladder, prostate, and rectum). DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS--The trial was stopped because of the increased mortality in patients with cancer of the cervix, bladder, or rectum treated with neutrons. 
Noninvasive face mask mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Mechanically assisted intermittent positive-pressure ventilation effectively provides ventilatory support in patients with respiratory failure but it requires placing an artificial airway. We have previously reported our successful experience delivering mechanical ventilation via a face mask (FMMV) rather than with an endotracheal tube in a pilot study of patients with acute respiratory failure. The present investigation evaluated an additional 18 patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to determine the efficacy of FMMV in a more homogeneous group and to determine factors predicting its success. FMMV was successful in avoiding intubation in 13 of the 18 patients. A significant initial improvement in PCO2 (greater than 16 percent decrease) and in pH (from less than 7.30 to greater than 7.30) predicted success. The five patients who failed on FMMV required endotracheal intubation because of inability to improve gas exchange (three patients), apnea due to sedatives (one patient), and management of secretions (one patient). FMMV was generally well accepted with only two patients withdrawn because of intolerance of the mask. The mean duration of FMMV was 25 h. Complications were seen in only two patients (11 percent): aspiration (one patient) and mild skin necrosis (one patient). Seven patients entered the study by meeting entrance criteria after an unsuccessful extubation attempt and therefore received both forms of mechanical ventilation. All but one patient avoided reintubation, and the face mask proved to be as effective as the endotracheal tube as a conduit for delivering the mechanical tidal volume and improving gas exchange. Our findings indicate that FMMV is a viable option for short-term (one to four days) ventilatory support of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and insufficiency. 
Evaluation of combination thrombolytic therapy and timing of cardiac catheterization in acute myocardial infarction. Results of thrombolysis and angioplasty in myocardial infarction--phase 5 randomized trial. TAMI Study Group Recent trials of myocardial reperfusion using single-agent thrombolytic therapy and sequential cardiac catheterization have supported a conservative approach to the patient with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate combination thrombolytic therapy and the role of a previously untested strategy for the aggressive use of cardiac catheterization, we performed a multicenter clinical trial with a 3 x 2 factorial design in which 575 patients were randomly allocated to one of three drug regimens--tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 191), urokinase (n = 190), or both (n = 194) - and one of two catheterization strategies--immediate catheterization with angioplasty for failed thrombolysis (n = 287) or deferred predischarge catheterization on days 5-10 (n = 288). Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, cardiogenic shock, or age of more than 75 years were excluded. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved and almost identical at predischarge catheterization (54%), regardless of the catheterization or thrombolytic strategy used (p = 0.98). Combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with a less complicated clinical course, most clearly documented by a lower rate of reocclusion (2%) compared with urokinase (7%) and t-PA (12%) (p = 0.04) and a lower rate of recurrent ischemia (25%) compared with urokinase (35%) and t-PA (31%). When a composite clinical end point (e.g., death, stroke, reinfarction, reocclusion, heart failure, or recurrent ischemia) was examined, combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with greater freedom from any adverse event (68%) compared with either single agent (urokinase, 55%; t-PA, 60%) (p = 0.04) and with a less complicated clinical course when the composite clinical end points were ranked according to clinical severity (p = 0.024). Early patency rates were greater with combination therapy, although predischarge patency rates after considering interventions to maintain patency were similar among drug regimens. No difference in bleeding complication rates was observed with any thrombolytic regimen. The aggressive catheterization strategy led to an overall early patency rate of 96% and a predischarge patency rate of 94% compared with a 90% predischarge patency in the conservative strategy (p = 0.065). The aggressive strategy improved regional wall motion in the infarct region (-2.16 SDs/chord) compared with deferred catheterization (-2.49 SDs/chord) (p = 0.004). More patients treated with the aggressive strategy were free from adverse outcomes (67% versus 55% in the conservative strategy, p = 0.004), and the clinical course was less complicated when the adverse outcomes were ranked according to severity (p = 0.016). No significant increase in use of blood products resulted from the aggressive strategy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Colonoscopically guided tube decompression in Ogilvie's syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome (pseudo-obstruction of the colon) may result in gangrene and perforation of the colon if not effectively treated. Colonoscopic decompression and endoscopically guided rectal tube placement were employed to treat five patients with this syndrome who had failed medical therapy. All patients tolerated the procedure well and required no further treatment. 
Introducing an acute pain service. An acute pain service in a new district general hospital is described. We have reported incidence of severe pain, common postoperative anaesthetic problems and patient satisfaction in relation to the analgesic technique. Over half the patients were treated by intermittent intramuscular injection of opioid, but increase in the use of continuous intravenous therapy and in particular patient-controlled analgesia, was welcomed by both medical and nursing staff. 
Specific triggering of gamma, delta T cells by K562 activates the gamma, delta T cell receptor and may regulate natural killer-like function. Freshly isolated and resting gamma/delta T cell lines, although capable of lysing a variety of MHC-unrestricted targets, fail to lyse K562. Yet, the killing of K562 can be specifically induced by antibodies to CD3 or delta-chains. Although this phenomenon may be caused by redirected lysis, it also raised the possibility that K562 may possess ligands capable of specifically interacting with the gamma/delta receptor. We found that K562 specifically induced both CD3 and delta modulation as well as IL-2R expression and IL-2 production by gamma/delta cells, supporting the idea that the TCR-gamma/delta is specifically triggered by K562 cells. Moreover, although the gamma/delta cell clones lysed other target cells (e.g., Molt 4, U937, Jurkat etc.), these latter targets did not induce delta modulation or IL-2R expression. In addition, F(ab)2 anti-CD3 antibodies inhibited activated gamma/delta T cells from killing K562 but did not inhibit the lysis of the other targets. Taken together, these results suggest that gamma/delta cells lyse some targets by utilizing receptors (perhaps NK-like) distinct from the gamma/delta receptor. We also found that triggering of the gamma/delta receptor by K562 inhibited the capacity of resting gamma/delta to lyse Molt 4 cells under conditions in which the K562 cells were not lysed. These findings suggest that the gamma/delta receptor maybe directly involved in the lysis of certain targets (i.e., K562) and, importantly, may potentially regulate the function of NK-like receptors that are involved in the lysis of other targets. 
Modified Indiana pouch. The modified continent Indiana pouch is based upon the terminal 8 to 12 cm. of ileum and 26 to 30 cm. of right colon. Our modifications include complete detubularization of the colonic segment with an easier appendectomy, a transcolonic ureteral reimplantation that is technically simple and reinforced plication of the ileocecal junction. This procedure was performed in 70 patients (ages 27 to 85 years) with followup ranging between 3 and 24 months. There have been 5 hospitalizations for urinary tract infections or gastrointestinal complications. Open surgical revision (4%) has been necessary for incontinence in 1 case, for a redundant ileal limb and difficult catheterization in 1, and for ureteral stenosis in the mid portion of the left ureter in 1. A revision procedure is pending for inadequate reservoir volume. Endoscopic meatotomy of ureterocolonic junction strictures has been necessary in 2 cases. All patients are continent day and night with easy catheterization of volumes ranging between 400 and 800 cc. The modified Indiana pouch should be considered for any patient requiring cutaneous urinary diversion because of a low complication and revision rate, and an excellent continence rate. 
Gastrostomy tube transmigration: a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. A 77-year-old woman with an indwelling gastrostomy tube presented with a clinical picture of pneumonia and small bowel obstruction. During gastrostomy closure and performance of a feeding jejunostomy, inadvertent transmigration of the gastrostomy tube was found to be the etiology of the small intestinal obstruction. This case illustrates a rare complication of enteric feeding tubes. 
Colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene in a diabetic patient. We present a case of colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene. Precipitating factors were diabetes and vesical distension caused by the obstruction of an indwelling catheter. This complication is an exceptional outcome in gangrenous cystitis and it requires emergency surgical treatment. 
Prognosis in AZT myopathy. The myopathy caused by zidovudine (AZT) appears to be common but is incompletely characterized, particularly regarding prognosis. Twenty patients with HIV infection developed a necrotizing myopathy while taking AZT for 9 to 30 months. Ten presented with myalgia and 17 with proximal muscle weakness. Serum CK was elevated in all (two to 11 times normal), and EMG suggested active myopathy in all but two. There were scattered granular degenerating fibers, with scant or no inflammation, in a pattern consistent with a toxic myopathy in all 18 patients biopsied. Three patients with an HIV-related inflammatory myopathy were distinguished by histologic differences. After stopping AZT (n = 15), myalgia promptly resolved (10 of 10). Strength improved more slowly with 12 of 15 regaining normal or nearly normal strength, but three have persistent weakness. CK returned to normal in 12 of 15, and follow-up EMG (n = 11) documented reduced fibrillation density in all 11 patients. These findings underscore the need for early diagnosis of this reversible myopathy. 
Somatostatin cerebrospinal fluid levels in dementia. Somatostatin levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus and compared with levels from a normal control group. All pathological groups showed a statistically significant decrease of somatostatin with respect to the control group, but no significant differences were found amongst them. A negative correlation was found between the Mini Mental State Test and the somatostatin levels in Alzheimer's disease patients but not in the other groups. Our results confirm that the lower levels of somatostatin in cerebrospinal fluid are not specific to Alzheimer's disease and indicate that the decrease found in all the groups is probably the result of neuronal destruction or damage in the diseases examined. 
Human acid maltase-deficient myogenic cell transformation with origin-defective SV40: characterization of a cloned line. A clonal human skeletal muscle cell line showing acid maltase deficiency (AMD) was established through the transfection of origin-defective SV40 DNA. The low acid alpha-glucosidase activity and glycogenosomes in this clone corresponded to AMD. This clone, in spite of loading glycogenososmes, was competent not only as to proliferation without contact inhibition but also as to myogenic differentiation to some extent. Dexamethasone promoted the formation by the transformant of multinucleated myotubes, which expressed acetylcholine receptors. The existence of glycogenosomes did not seem to affect the proliferation or differentiation of myoblasts. The aberrant acid alpha-glucosidase expressed in the transformed myogenic clone was shown to be biochemically identical to that in AMD fibroblasts. This transformant should be of great value for investigating the pathogenesis of AMD because of the possibility of supplying semi-permanently a uniform myogenic cell line expressing AMD. 
Late onset Krabbe's leukodystrophy: a report of four cases. Four cases of late-onset Krabbe's leukodystrophy had varying clinical features. One sibling became wheelchair-bound while another leads an active working life. The computed tomography (CT) scan of a third patient showed occipital demyelination with contrast enhancement identical to that seen in an adrenoleucodystrophy. The fourth was the only patient with peripheral neuropathy. All patients had enzyme activity comparable to the classic infantile-onset form. 
MIDAS, the Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study. Design features and baseline data. The Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) is a randomized, double-blind, active-control trial to compare the effectiveness of two treatment regimens for the control of hypertension in reducing the rate of progression of early extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients. The two double-blind treatment regimens are 2.5 or 5 mg isradipine twice daily and 12.5 mg or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide twice daily. Patients whose blood pressure is not controlled with either of these regimens will receive, in addition to the highest tolerated dose of the blinded drug, 2.5 to 10 mg open-label enalapril twice daily. The MIDAS study has enrolled 883 patients to treatment with either isradipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Inclusion criteria included men and women over the age of 40 years, the presence of an atherosclerotic lesion in the extracranial carotid artery demonstrated on B-mode ultrasound scanning (maximum thickness between 1.3 and 3.5 mm), an average sitting diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 115 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein levels between 130 and 189 mg/dL. An assessment of each patient's blood pressure and any side effects is made every three months; a B-mode ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries was performed at baseline and every six months thereafter; an electrocardiogram was carried out at baseline and once a year thereafter; and a brief quality-of-life assessment was made at baseline and every year thereafter. 
Abnormal platelet and lymphocyte calcium handling in prehypertensive rats. We have reported that the basal and stimulated cytosolic free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) are elevated in platelets isolated from 12-14-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. To determine whether altered cell calcium metabolism precedes the development of overt hypertension, we measured [Ca2+]i under resting and stimulated conditions in blood platelets and thymic lymphocytes isolated from 4-week-old prehypertensive SHR and WKY rats. Blood pressure was similar in both groups (SHR 95 +/- 8 versus WKY rats 92 +/- 7 mm Hg). Basal [Ca2+]i in platelets was higher in SHR than WKY rats (63.4 +/- 3.9 versus 54.8 +/- 3.1 nM, p less than 0.003). Also the [Ca2+]i response to thrombin was greater in SHR than WKY rats in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. For lymphocytes, although no difference was detected in basal [Ca2+]i, the concanavalin A-induced peak [Ca2+]i was higher for SHR than WKY rats in both calcium-containing and calcium-free media. These results suggest that agonist-stimulated calcium influx and calcium discharge from intracellular stores are enhanced in both platelets and lymphocytes of 4-week-old SHR. We conclude that abnormalities in calcium metabolism in two different cell types precede the development of overt hypertension in the SHR. 
Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with fulminant and severe hepatitis BACKGROUND. The presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum is known to be a marker of a high degree of viral infectivity. However, fulminant hepatitis may occur in persons who are negative for HBeAg. A single point mutation has been reported to produce a stop codon in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA and prevent the formation of the precore protein required to make HBeAg. To determine whether a precore-mutant virus is causally related to severe liver injury, we analyzed the entire precore region in viral strains isolated from patients with fatal cases and uncomplicated cases of hepatitis B. METHODS. Serum was obtained from 9 patients with fatal hepatitis B (5 with fulminant and 4 with severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis) and 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. Serum samples from a sex partner implicated as the source of the virus in one case of fulminant hepatitis were also studied. The 87 nucleotides in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. RESULTS. Of the nine patients with fatal hepatitis, seven had retrievable hepatitis B DNA. In all seven there was a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region, converting tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this mutation was not found in the 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The hepatitis B DNA from the implicated source contained a sequence with the stop-codon mutation that was identical to the sequence in her partner, who had fulminant hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a mutant viral strain is associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B and severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B. 
The place of oophorectomy at vaginal hysterectomy. A series of 740 vaginal hysterectomies with attempted vaginal oophorectomy is presented and compared with 700 vaginal hysterectomies without oophorectomy. Vaginal oophorectomy was successful in 94% of the patients. Factors influencing the success include obesity, nulliparity, decreased vaginal access and space, lack of uterine descent, increased uterine size and tubo-ovarian disease. These have been analysed and the recognition and management of technical difficulties are described. There was no morbidity attributable to the vaginal oophorectomy. With experience and appropriate technique suitable women can be offered prophylactic oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. 
Hemostasis activation during esophageal variceal sclerotherapy with thrombin in cirrhotics. Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices in liver cirrhotics is a common procedure, but little is known about the possible entry of sclerosants into the systemic circulation. We injected a mixture of thrombin, sodium tetradecyl, and cefazolin and studied the effect of this sclerosant on selected hemostasis parameters. Twenty-four patients with liver cirrhosis (Child's Classification C) were studied 29 times. Blood samples were drawn before and immediately after the injection of the sclerosant. In seven patients we collected a sample 30 minutes and 24 hours after treatment. Before injection, almost all patients had elevated D-dimer, t-PA and PAI-1 levels. Fibrinogen, antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and protein C were decreased. Only thrombin/antithrombin III complex (TAT) levels were within normal ranges. Immediately after the injection, TAT, D-dimer, and t-PA levels rose significantly (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001), PAI-1 and PC levels decreased (P less than 0.01), while antithrombin, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and fibrinogen concentrations were unchanged. TAT and D-dimer levels were still elevated after 24 hours (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that thrombin entered the systemic circulation (elevated TAT) and that the hemostasis system was briefly systemically activated (elevated D-dimer). In spite of these changes in the hemostasis system, clinically there were no detectable thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. 
Electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide in malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease. The electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide were evaluated in 48 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing programmed stimulation for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The study group included 41 men and 7 women, aged 64 +/- 8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), who had presented with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (4 patients), sustained VT (32), ventricular fibrillation (8) or unexplained syncope (4). The left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 34 +/- 13%. The arrhythmias induced at the baseline, drug-free electrophysiologic study included nonsustained VT in 8 patients, sustained VT in 35 and ventricular fibrillation in 5. All patients had failed greater than or equal to 1 class IA and a combination of class IA and IB agents (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1 drugs) before encainide. Oral encainide was given in a mean daily dose of 80 +/- 11 mg for greater than or equal to 3 days before repeat programmed stimulation. Encainide was discontinued before follow-up electrophysiologic testing in 5 patients due to spontaneous development of new sustained VT. Of the 43 patients undergoing electropharmacologic testing with encainide, 5 had no inducible arrhythmia. In 9 patients VT was inducible by fewer extrastimuli, in 2 patients a previously stable VT required cardioversion, whereas in 28 patients VT remained inducible by the same number of or more extrastimuli. Thus, encainide prevented the induction of VT or ventricular fibrillation in 5 of 48 patients (10%), while it had a possible proarrhythmic effect in 15 patients (31%). Of the 5 patients without inducible VT administered long-term encainide therapy, 1 returned within 4 weeks of hospital discharge with VT recurrence. 
Evidence for alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in hypotensive cirrhotic patients with ascites. Cirrhosis with ascites is often characterized by arterial hypotension associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels. Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings. 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists and migraine therapy. Neuronal 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors mediate the excitatory effects of 5-HT. They are located in pain- and nausea-modulating areas in the central nervous system and on C-fibre primary afferents in the peripheral nervous system. Consequently, these receptors mediate the painful and emetic effects of 5-HT. Selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to block inflammatory and 5-HT induced and potentiated "vascular pain". Based on the hypothesis that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may block neurogenic dural inflammation in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve and, thus, could potentially prevent migraine (pain), four highly selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been tested in both the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine. Unfortunately, except for a clear anti-emetic effect, none of these drugs has shown unequivocal efficacy in the treatment of migraine. This may be partly due to the complex (bell-shaped) dose-response relationship of these compounds, making exact titration of the correct dose difficult. Moreover, most 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have proved to be toxic in man on chronic administration thereby preventing further trials in migraine with adjusted doses. Short-term treatment for cytotoxic drug-induced emesis so far appears to be the only proven indication for 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 
Closure of tracheocutaneous fistula with perichondrial flap following cricothyroidotomy. A method for closure of large tracheocutaneous fistulas occurring in the cricothyroid membrane is described. Though an infrequent complication, large defects in this area can be successfully repaired with this technique. 
Chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide/mesna plus cisplatin for the treatment of ovarian cancer: a study of the Grupo de Estudio y Tratamiento Latino-Americano del Cancer. Twenty-one evaluable patients with FIGO stages II-IV epithelial ovarian cancer, median age 57 (range 47-75 years), were treated with ifosfamide (IF), 3 g/m2 diluted in 500 ml saline solution, 8 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on days 1-5; mesna 20% of IF dose, i.v. bolus injection, was given at hours 0 and 4; mesna 40% of IF dose by oral route at hours 8 and 12, days 1-5; plus cisplatin 20 mg/m2 diluted in 500 ml saline solution, 2 hour i.v. infusion, days 1-5. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. All patients had metastatic lesions (mesentery, pleura, colon, cervix, abdominal wall, lung, liver, bladder, and nodes). Toxicity ranged from mild to moderate. All patients experienced alopecia, nausea, and vomiting. Neutropenia and anemia ranged from mild to moderate. One patient experienced mild brain confusion and two patients microscopic hematuria. Ten clinically complete responses (47%) and five clinically partial responses (23%) were registered, for an overall 70% objective response. However, after a second look performance in 10 patients with clinically complete response, six of 10 patients showed a pathological complete response and four showed pathological partial response. The median duration of complete response is about 33 months, and median partial response duration is 14 months. Although the numbers are small, these data indicate that combination chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide/mesna plus cisplatin may be an active treatment for advanced ovarian carcinoma. 
Glucose uptake, perfusion, and cell proliferation in head and neck tumors: relation of positron emission tomography to flow cytometry The uptake of 18F-Deoxyglucose (FDG) was studied in vivo in relation to the proliferation rate of human head and neck tumors. Forty-two patients with histologically proven squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck and four patients with metastases of head and neck tumors were examined with PET and FDG prior to surgery. In 35 of these patients, a flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content and the proliferation rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry (DAPI staining). In 17 cases, perfusion studies with 15O-labeled water were performed. Twenty-seven specimens were evaluable by flow cytometry. The analysis of the distribution of the FDG uptake revealed two groups, showing a high and a lower uptake pattern. In both groups the FDG uptake and the proliferation rate were correlated with an r-value of 0.64 and 0.8 respectively. However, the slope of the regression function was flat. No correlation was found between the perfusion and the proliferation rate. It is suggested that these differences in uptake in histologically identical tumor populations may correspond to differences at the molecular level, e.g., differences in the amount of the glucose carrier, perhaps caused by oncogenic transformation. 
A case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. We have recently observed a rare case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. To determine the mechanism of such a coexistence in this particular case, we compared the constitutional and pheochromocytoma genotypes of the patient using polymorphic four DNA markers, and we found a loss of heterozygosity at the D1S7 locus. A loss of heterozygosity at this locus has previously been reported by Mathew et al. in pheochromocytoma patients, and our results were in agreement with that study. Therefore the allelic deletion at the D1S7 locus may be an important step in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytoma in this case. 
Influence of hepatitis B virus infection and age on mode of growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion at the time of initial diagnosis, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were grouped into three or four groups. Correlations among the extent of hepatic involvement, extent of portal vein invasion, and prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and age distribution were examined. The extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion were significantly greater in patients with positive HBsAg compared with findings in the negative patients (P less than 0.001). For cases of both positive and negative HBsAg, patients with a more extensive HCC were significantly younger. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatitis B antigenemia and younger age were statistically significant and independent positive predictors of extensive HCC. These results strongly suggest that hepatitis B surface antigenemia and age play an important role in the growth mode and the kinetics of HCC in Japanese patients. 
Effect of mild hyperthermia on the ischemic infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. We investigated the effect of mild whole-body hyperthermia (40 degrees C) on a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in Fisher rats by subjecting them to MCAo under the following conditions: (1) normothermia (n = 20); (2) hyperthermia (n = 14) before (1 hour), during, and after (1 hour) MCAo; and (3) post-MCAo hyperthermia (n = 14) for 1 hour. We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain. We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo. We detected no differences in BBB permeability among three groups. The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals. Our data suggest that mild hyperthermia, both during and after induction of ischemia, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic infarct volume in this model. 
Systemic neurohumoral activation and vasoconstriction during pacing-induced acute myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina pectoris. To identify the effect of myocardial ischemia on systemic neurohormones and vascular resistance, 32 untreated, normotensive patients with coronary artery disease underwent incremental atrial pacing until angina. Arterial and coronary venous lactate and arterial values of catecholamines and angiotensin II were determined at control, at maximal pacing rates, and at 1, 2, 5 and 30 minutes after pacing. Based on pacing-induced ST-segment depression (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) or myocardial lactate production, or both, patients were selected as ischemic (n = 25) or nonischemic (n = 7). Baseline clinical and hemodynamic data were comparable. During pacing, chest pain was similar (20 ischemic vs 7 nonischemic patients). Also, hemodynamic measurements were comparable, except for contractility, which did not improve, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which significantly increased in ischemic patients. Moreover, during ischemia arterial pressures increased significantly (13%) and systemic resistance increased from 1,470 +/- 60 (control) to 1,632 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5 5 minutes after pacing (p less than 0.05) in ischemic but not in nonischemic patients. Pacing did not affect neurohormones in nonischemic patients. In contrast, norepinephrine in ischemic patients increased significantly from 1.7 +/- 0.2 (control) to 2.6 +/- 0.3 (maximal pacing) and to 3.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter (1 minute after pacing), whereas angiotensin II levels increased from 6.2 +/- 1.4 (control) to 9.3 +/- 2.1 pmol/liter (1 minute after pacing, p less than 0.05). Epinephrine only increased during maximal rates (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/liter at control, p less than 0.05). Thus, myocardial ischemia activates circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction. 
Cigarette smoking and other vascular risk factors in vasculogenic impotence. A total of 132 consecutive patients with erectile impotence underwent extensive evaluation, including vascular evaluation with intracavernous injection of papaverine and penile duplex ultrasonography, to determine the etiology of impotence. Three vascular risk factors, smoking, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, were investigated for their impact on vasculogenic impotence. The patients were divided into four groups: one with no risk factors, one with one vascular risk factor, one with two vascular risk factors, and one with all three risk factors. The results of penile vascular evaluation in these patient groups were compared. The incidence of penile vascular impairment was found to be higher in patients with one vascular risk factor than in those with none. The proportion of abnormal penile vascular findings significantly increased as the number of risk factors increased. These data confirm the important role of vascular risk factors, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, in the pathogenesis of organic impotence. 
A randomized comparison of multipolar electrocoagulation and injection sclerosis for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer. Several options are available to the gastroenterologist for the endoscopic control of peptic ulcer hemorrhage. Sixty men (mean age, 62 years) were stratified into those with actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with stigmata of recent hemorrhage, and then randomized to treatment with injection sclerosis or the multipolar probe until bleeding ceased. There were no significant differences between the randomized groups in terms of age, ulcer size, or transfusion requirements. We achieved hemostasis in 95% of all patients. Re-bleeding rates were 25% and 23% in patients treated with the multipolar probe and injection sclerosis, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality (14% multipolar probe, 7% injection sclerosis). Patients over the age of 70, those whose onset of bleeding was while an inpatient, and those with an ulcer larger than 2 cm were more likely to have a poor outcome, regardless of the type of endoscopic therapy. Injection sclerosis and multipolar electrocoagulation are equally effective in controlling bleeding from peptic ulcer. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Failure of centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency of the tibia. Between 1962 and 1983, fourteen patients (twenty knees) had centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete. Eleven of the twenty index procedures were performed on patients who were one year old or less. A progressive flexion deformity of the knee developed after all twenty index procedures. Twenty-six secondary procedures were needed, including disarticulation at the knee, posterior release, extension osteotomy, femorofibular arthrodesis, and biceps-to-quadriceps transfer, and one patient had a second attempt at centralization of the fibula. The duration of follow-up after the initial centralization of the fibula ranged from four years to twenty-two years and seven months (average, twelve years and four months). Seven patients (eight limbs) in whom the index procedure resulted in failure had a satisfactory result after disarticulation at the knee. The patients who did not have secondary disarticulation at the knee are also considered to have had a failed index procedure because they had a flexion deformity at the latest follow-up. Attempts to reconstruct the knee joint by centralization of the fibula are not warranted for patients who have congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete. Early disarticulation at the knee and fitting with a prosthesis, with close follow-up, is the treatment of choice. 
Effects of a sodium-potassium ion-exchanging seaweed preparation in mild hypertension. A nonpharmacological approach in the treatment of mild hypertension is often advocated. In an attempt to decrease sodium and increase potassium intake, sixty-two middle-aged patients with mild hypertension were given a potassium loaded ion-exchanging sodium-adsorbing potassium-releasing seaweed preparation (seaweed fiber, SF). The mean blood pressure (MBP), evaluated in a double-blind crossover manner with four weeks familiarization and wash-out periods, showed a significant decrease after four weeks on 12 and 24 g/day SF but not on 6 g/day or placebo treatment. Systolic blood pressure during submaximal exercise decreased on all three SF doses. The decrease in MBP appeared to be significantly higher in sodium-sensitive (11.2 mm Hg, P less than .001) than in sodium-insensitive (5.7 mm Hg, P less than .05) patients and was in salt-sensitive patients significantly correlated to the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). The urinary sodium excretion decreased, the urinary potassium increased and the sodium/potassium urinary excretion ratio decreased, indicating that the decrease of MBP was dependent on the decreased intestinal absorption of sodium and increased absorption of potassium released from the seaweed preparation. A sodium-potassium ion-exchanging seaweed preparation is an effective means of decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake, and may be used for antihypertensive treatment in mild hypertension. 
Simulation of high-resolution QRS complex using a ventricular model with a fractal conduction system. Effects of ischemia on high-frequency QRS potentials. Recent studies have analyzed the high-fidelity surface electrocardiographic signal, and efforts have been made to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the electrocardiogram by observing its high-frequency components. It was found that the high-frequency (150-250-Hz) electrocardiogram appears to detect evidence of transient ischemia with greater sensitivity than visual inspection of the surface electrocardiogram. A finite-element three-dimensional model of the ventricles with a self-similar (fractal) conduction system has been introduced as a bridge to the understanding of electrocardiographic phenomena related to high-frequency potentials. The model was activated, and the dipole potential generated by adjacent activated and resting cells was calculated to obtain a high-resolution QRS complex. Normal and ischemic activation processes was stimulated by regional reduction in conduction velocity. It was found that although the resulted low-frequency QRS complex was not significantly altered from normal conditions, the high-frequency components exhibited morphological changes similar to the ones observed during animal experiments and human studies. Based on the results obtained from the model, it can be concluded that these morphological changes can be attributed to a slowing of conduction velocity in the region of ischemia and that the model is adequate for meeting the challenges imposed by the requirements of high-frequency methods applied in clinical cardiology. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Visual impairment and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether impaired visual acuity is associated with dementia and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. DESIGN: Paired case-control comparisons of the relative frequencies of visual impairment in demented cases and nondemented controls. Cohort analyses of correlation between visual acuity and cognitive functioning in demented cases. SETTING: Internal medicine clinics at two academically affiliated medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven consecutively selected patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with mild-to-moderate, clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (cases) and 87 nondemented controls matched to the cases by age, sex, and education. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of visual impairment was higher in cases than in controls [unadjusted odds ratio for near-vision impairment = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 5.2); unadjusted odds ratio for far-vision impairment = 2.1 (95% CI = 1.02, 4.3); odds ratios adjusted for family history of dementia, depression, number of medications, and hearing loss were 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 10.5) for near-vision impairment and 1.9 (95% CI = 0.8, 4.6) for far-vision impairment]. When further stratified by quartiles of visual acuity, no statistically significant "dose-response" relationship between vision impairment and dementia risk was observed. Among cases, the degree of visual impairment was significantly correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction for both near and far vision (adjusted ps less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Visual impairment is associated with both an increased risk and an increased clinical severity of Alzheimer's disease, but the increased risk may not be consistent with a progressive dose-response relationship. Further studies are needed to determine whether visual impairment unmasks and exacerbates the symptoms of dementia or is a marker of disease severity. 
Recurring catamenial pneumothorax treated with a Gn-RH analogue. We report a case of recurring catamenial pneumothorax with concurrent pelvic endometriosis. Thoracoscopy revealed a blue-like lesion on top of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm. Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens showed endometriosis. The patient was treated with a Gn-RH analogue and remains well without further evidence of pneumothorax after six months. 
Sixth nerve schwannomas. Report of two cases. Two cases of sixth cranial nerve schwannoma are presented with a review of four other cases from the literature. The clinical spectrum, neuroradiological findings, and surgical outcome of the six cases are discussed. There are two distinct clinical presentations for sixth cranial nerve schwannomas. Type I sixth nerve schwannomas present with sixth nerve palsy and diplopia and arise from the cavernous sinus. In contrast, type II sixth nerve schwannomas have a more severe presentation with obstructive hydrocephalus, raised intracranial pressure, sixth nerve palsy, and diplopia. This type arises along the course of the sixth cranial nerve in the prepontine area. Cavernous sinus involvement in either type may preclude total surgical excision and indicate an increase possibility for recurrence. 
Differentiation between hemangiomas and metastases of the liver with ultrafast MR imaging: preliminary results with T2 calculations. We studied the efficacy of T2 measurements at high field strength in distinguishing between liver hemangiomas and hepatic metastases when an ultrafast (single-excitation) MR imaging technique is used. Fourteen patients with known liver tumors were imaged in a 2.0-T prototype ultrafast MR scanner with a spin-echo (infinite TR and TE of 30-340 msec) pulse sequence. Each image was obtained with a total data acquisition time of 20 msec. T2 calculations for hepatic metastases (n = 6) showed a mean of 79.3 +/- 13.5 msec, whereas hemangiomas (n = 8) showed a T2 of 139.8 +/- 18.8 msec (p less than .0001). T2 values of lesions had a smaller relative standard deviation than previously reported, and the range of T2 values of hemangiomas (119-181 msec) and metastases (68-103 msec) did not overlap. Our preliminary results suggest that T2 calculations with ultrafast MR imaging may be useful for differentiating hemangiomas from metastases. We hypothesize that T2 values obtained from ultrafast MR images are more reliable than those obtained from conventional MR images, primarily because of the elimination of T1 information and effects of motion on image signal intensity. 
Cerebral circulation: humoral regulation and effects of chronic hypertension. New concepts have emerged in recent years concerning regulation of cerebral circulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize briefly several of these concepts. First, humoral mechanisms may have important effects on cerebral blood vessels and blood flow to choroid plexus. Recent evidence suggests that several vasoactive peptides may have major effects on fluid and ion balance in the brain by altering blood flow to the choroid plexus and possibly the production of cerebrospinal fluid. Second, chronic hypertension produces structural remodeling and hypertrophy of cerebral blood vessels and a shift in the relationship of cerebral blood flow to systemic blood pressure. Third, endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor and nonreceptor mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. Alterations in endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles during chronic hypertension appears to be due to release of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. 
Ischemic necrosis: a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of spontaneously ruptured enterocystoplasty. Spontaneous enterocystoplasty rupture represents a devastating and potentially fatal late complication. Previously proposed mechanisms of rupture include catheter trauma, chronic infection, avulsion of adhesions between the bowel patch and peritoneum, and chronic overdistension with elevated intravesical pressures. We have witnessed this complication 4 times in 3 patients 5 weeks to 46 months postoperatively. Tissue specimens from 3 episodes in 2 patients with detubularized sigmoid enterocystoplasties were available for histological examination. All patients had a neurogenic bladder from myelomeningocele, all had an AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter and all had a documented history of chronic distension from inadequate emptying of the augmented bladder. At exploration, all of the ruptures were found within the bowel segment near the bladder apex in an area remote from the anastomotic line. In each case tissue specimens from the rupture site showed marked vascular congestion, intramural hemorrhage, abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages, myofiber atrophy and intravascular thrombi. These features are interpreted to reflect the sequelae of vascular compromise and ischemia. We propose that enterocystoplasty rupture results from ischemia, possibly due to chronic overdistension and subsequent vascular compromise. This mechanism may account for many of the previously reported cases of enterocystoplasty rupture. 
Prospective cohort study of prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome. Studies of the link between prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome have been criticised on grounds of recall bias and for not taking into account possible confounding effects. To avoid recall bias and to allow measurement of important biological factors a prospective cohort study of the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is being conducted. The infants included are those at high risk of the syndrome as assessed by a perinatal score. Of the 3110 members of the cohort born between January, 1988, and end of March, 1990, 23 infants later died of SIDS. Sleep position information was available for 15 of these. Matched analysis to control for the confounding effects of infant birthweight and maternal age indicated that prone sleeping position was associated with an increased risk of SIDS (OR 4.47 95% Cl [1.30-15.43]). The findings are strengthened by the results of a concurrent retrospective case-control study of 42 SIDS cases in which the prone position was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS (unadjusted OR 3.45 [1.59-7.49]). 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(4;11) translocation after osteogenic sarcoma. The authors report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) (q21;q23) occurring 9 months after treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. Cell surface marker and molecular analyses suggest early B lineage involvement. This is the first report, to the knowledge of the authors, of t(4;11) ALL arising after an osteogenic sarcoma. The observations of the authors support the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of leukemia with t(4;11). 
Measuring cell proliferation. Histopathology is based on the interpretation of features of the microscopic image. In recent years, there has evolved interest in assessing quantifiable data from these images, with the intent of providing more precise diagnostic and prognostic information. Proliferation characteristics of tumors are among the most important of these data. Methods for measuring cell proliferation are reviewed. 
Miosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures. We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia. The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region. We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area. 
Multiple renal neoplasms: a case of 3 histologically dissimilar primary tumors. A 69-year-old woman who presented with bilateral renal masses and gross hematuria was found to have 3 different primary renal neoplasms. She first underwent left partial nephrectomy for an oncocytoma and subsequently right radical nephroureterectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the pelvis. An incidental angiomyolipoma was found in the specimen. Deoxyribonucleic acid image analysis of all 3 tumors is presented. 
The beneficial effects of early dexamethasone administration in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. BACKGROUND. In experimental models of meningitis and in children with meningitis, dexamethasone has been shown to reduce meningeal inflammation and to improve the outcome of disease. METHODS. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of dexamethasone therapy in 101 infants and children admitted to the National Children's Hospital, San Jose, Costa Rica, who had culture-proved bacterial meningitis or clinical signs of meningitis and findings characteristic of bacterial infection on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone and cefotaxime (n = 52) or cefotaxime plus placebo (n = 49). Dexamethasone (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of cefotaxime and was continued every 6 hours thereafter for four days. RESULTS. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles were similar for the patients in the two treatment groups. By 12 hours after the beginning of therapy, the mean opening cerebrospinal pressure and the estimated cerebral perfusion pressure had improved significantly in the dexamethasone-treated children but worsened in the children treated only with cefotaxime (controls). At 12 hours meningeal inflammation and the concentrations of two cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and platelet-activating factor) in the cerebrospinal fluid had decreased in the dexamethasone-treated children, whereas in the controls the inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid had increased. At 24 hours the clinical condition and mean prognostic score were significantly better among those treated with dexamethasone than among the controls. At follow-up examination after a mean of 15 months, 7 of the surviving 51 dexamethasone-treated children (14 percent) and 18 of 48 surviving controls (38 percent) had one or more neurologic or audiologic sequelae (P = 0.007); the relative risk of sequelae for a child receiving placebo as compared with a child receiving dexamethasone was 3.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 11.5). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study, in which dexamethasone administration began before the initiation of cefotaxime therapy, provide additional evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. 
High doses of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon for chronic hepatitis C: a randomized, controlled trial. Chronic hepatitis C is often a progressive liver disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment. We studied the efficacy of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU alpha-interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with gamma-interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment. The mean serum ALT levels and liver histological findings improved significantly only in the patients treated with alpha-interferon. No changes were observed in patients treated with gamma-interferon or in controls. Five of 10 patients treated with alpha-interferon had complete responses (mean ALT normal during therapy). After treatment ALT returned to pretreatment levels in two of 5 patients. The long-term response rate after alpha-interferon therapy was 30% at 18 mo. We conclude that alpha-interferon is effective in controlling disease activity in a portion of patients with chronic hepatitis C. High doses of alpha-interferon do not appear to add further benefit in the response rate or relapse rate. gamma-Interferon therapy is ineffective. 
Fluorescein angiographic risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 13. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), a multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute, one eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation (i.e., careful follow-up and initiation of photocoagulation only if high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed). This design allowed observation of the natural course of diabetic retinopathy in the initially untreated eye. Gradings of baseline stereoscopic fluorescein angiograms of these eyes were used to examine relationships of angiographic characteristics with each other, with retinopathy severity level and macular edema status graded from color photographs, and with risk of progression from nonproliferative to proliferative retinopathy during 1 to 5 years of follow-up. Fluorescein leakage (particularly diffuse), capillary loss and dilatation, and various arteriolar abnormalities were associated with retinopathy severity and with the likelihood of progression to proliferative retinopathy during follow-up. Severity of fluorescein leakage was strongly associated with macular edema. 
Headaches due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and follow up. Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not an infrequent cause of headache and acute neurologic deficits in the younger population. Angiography has been the imaging modality of choice for both diagnosis and follow-up. The use of magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), in conjunction with angiography, is described in three patients shown to have ICA dissection. Our clinical findings suggest that MRI may provide a less expensive, non-invasive, diagnostic and particularly a follow up modality in patients with headache and signs suggestive of ICA dissection. 
Midbrain vs. pontine medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions: the utilization of masseter and blink reflexes. Masseter (MR) and blink reflexes (BL) were investigated in 51 patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to multiple sclerosis (28) and lacunar infarction (23). The MR was abnormal in 20 of 23 cases with bilateral INO and in 21 of 28 with unilateral INO. The R1 component of the BL (BL-R1) was abnormal in 7 of 23 patients with bilateral INO and 10 of 28 with unilateral INO. Combined MR and BL-R1 changes occurred in 8 of 28 cases with unilateral INO and 7 of 23 with bilateral INO. The findings provide evidence for a rostral/caudal localization of lesions within the medial longitudinal fasciculus causing INO on the basis of MR and BL-R1 abnormalities. An abnormality limited to MR suggests a midbrain location in 58.8% of patients while abnormal BL-R1 with or without an associated MR change suggests a rostral pontine location in 35.3%. 
Assessment of blood echogenicity as an alternative measure to erythrocyte sedimentation rate. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood echogenicity and whether measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be replaced by measurement of blood echogenicity in monitoring acute phase reactions. DESIGN--Simultaneous measurement of echogenicity of flowing blood and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples and comparison of results. SETTING--A radiological department in a university hospital. SUBJECTS--83 patients with a suspected venous thrombosis and 36 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, packed cell volume, and echogenicity of flowing blood. RESULTS--Blood echogenicity correlated poorly with the packed cell volume, but strongly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (when the packed cell volume was within reference limits) (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Blood samples with a greatly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate were highly echogenic. Only one of the 30 samples with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate below 10 mm in first hour had a higher echogenicity than the least echogenic sample of the 19 with a sedimentation rate above 30 mm in first hour. CONCLUSIONS--Echogenicity of flowing blood correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its measurement may compete with conventional methods for evaluating the long term changes in acute phase reactions. Also, it has the added advantage that non-invasive in vivo measurements of blood echogenicity may become possible. 
Is there a premorbid personality typical for Parkinson's disease? For decades clinicians have postulated a characteristic preexisting personality in patients who develop Parkinson's disease (PD). They are described as moralistic, law-abiding, conscientious, and averse to risk-taking. The limited personality surveys tend to be confirmatory, but most of the literature is anecdotal or replete with unprovable psychodynamic postulates. In addition to an apparent stability of marriages and lack of alcoholism, patients with PD are less likely than controls to be smokers. It has been suggested that nicotine and its byproducts are not actually protective against PD, and it could be postulated that higher-than-average intrinsic dopamine may facilitate addiction. Smoking for the patient who is later to develop PD may be particularly unrewarding. In addition, the postulated personality for PD may predispose to hard work, perspiration, and increased exposure to putative trace elements in the water supply. 
Headaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. 
Relapsing systemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a drug abuser seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. A case of recurrent multisystemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a patient with antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but without AIDS is reported. This case, which occurred in a woman with a history of alcohol and drug abuse, is, to our knowledge, the first such case described. The infection involved the lungs, kidneys, brain, and bloodstream. Despite several courses of therapy with antibiotics to which her isolates of R. equi were susceptible in vitro, the patient experienced multiple relapses before her death. On the basis of this case and a few others reported in HIV-infected patients, we recommend an initial antibiotic course at least 6-8 weeks in duration, and we suggest that combination antibiotic treatment be considered. We also suggest that infection with R. equi be included in the diagnostic criteria for AIDS. 
Preoperative insurance status influences postoperative complication rates for gastric bypass. One hundred morbidly obese patients who had gastric bypass surgery were studied to determine how various demographic and medical variables affected complication rates, weight loss, and reduction in comorbidities associated with obesity. During the follow-up period (range: 12 to 59 months), 42 patients developed at least 1 complication. Twenty-three patients developed postoperative medical complications, 9 developed psychiatric complications, and 24 developed complications related to food ingestion. No significant relationships were observed between outcome and age, sex, age of obesity onset, or associated medical disorders. Striking differences in outcome were noted, however, when patients were contrasted according to their preoperative insurance status. Patients dependent on medical assistance, social security disability, or workman's compensation (publicly funded group) (n = 40) developed significantly more medical and psychiatric complications than did those (n = 60) who had private medical insurance (p less than 0.02). Despite the higher complication rate, both groups had the same average weight loss (44.9 +/- 15.3 kg for the publicly funded group versus 43.1 +/- 12.9 kg for those with private insurance) and similar reductions in percent excess weight (66.0 +/- 18.4% versus 75.7 +/- 23.0%) during the first postoperative year. All patients also had similar reductions in medication requirements for hypertension, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease. Additionally, 45% of the publicly funded insurance group who either received public welfare (n = 26) or disability benefits (n = 14) preoperatively were able to attain either full-time or part-time employment postoperatively which allowed them to decrease their level of support (58% and 21%, respectively). Forty-six percent of women in the private insurance group who were not working outside the home also began part-time or full-time employment postoperatively. All patients who were working preoperatively continued to work. These data suggest that although the risks associated with gastric bypass surgery are greater in patients dependent on public funding, these patients benefit significantly from the surgery. 
Hemothorax as a complication following percutaneous renal biopsy. Percutaneous renal biopsy is a routine procedure with a low complication rate. We report a patient who developed shock and respiratory distress secondary to hemothorax following a fluoroscopically guided biopsy. 
Treatment of murine transitional cell carcinoma with intralesional interleukin 2 and murine interferon gamma. The antitumor effect of intralesionally administered recombinant interleukin-2, alone or in combination with recombinant interferon gamma was studied in murine transitional cell carcinoma, MBT2. In the initial prophylactic model treatment was started at day one at the site of tumor inoculation. Maximal and significant reduction in tumor volume occurred in groups receiving 4,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 and 10(7) colony forming units Bacillus Calmette Guerin (p less than 0.00001 vs saline control). In the same experiment, a reduction in tumor incidence and increase in survival occurred in groups receiving 4,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2, 1,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 plus 2,000 units of recombinant interferon gamma, as well as 10(7) colony forming units Bacillus Calmette Guerin relative to saline control (p less than 0.005). The dose-response effect of recombinant interleukin 2 alone was also tested in a model of an established transitional cell carcinoma. Intralesional injection treatments were initiated after tumors were palpable. Reduction in tumor volume was observed in the group receiving 8,000 units of recombinant interleukin 2 (p = 0.01 vs saline control), but no significant advantage in survival was noted. 
Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
Assessment of coronary artery disease by thallium scan in type-1 diabetic uremic patients awaiting combined pancreas and renal transplantation. Twenty-five type-1 diabetic uremic patients (14 men, 11 women, mean age forty +/- eleven years, range, nineteen to sixty) were prospectively analyzed for coronary artery disease (CAD) by thallium scan (TLS) before synchronus pancreas and kidney transplantation. Duration of diabetes ranged from ten to thirty-two years (mean twenty-two +/- five). Fifteen patients (60%) were in dialysis from two to sixty months (mean twenty +/- eighteen). Advanced diabetic degenerative complications were present in all patients. Twenty exercise and five pharmacologic thallium scans were performed. Forty-four percent of patients (6 men, 5 women, mean age forty-two +/- eleven years, range, twenty-six to sixty) had a positive (reversible or permanent defects) TLS. In 2/11 cases, severe CAD required further cardiac investigations for therapeutic management decision. A statistical correlation with resting ECG nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities was observed (p less than 0.05) despite the absence of angor in 8 of the 11 patients. On the contrary, no statistical correlations were found regarding high blood pressure, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, duration of diabetes, and duration of dialysis. In this particular diabetic population (young age, male/female ratio = 1.2) with high incidence of silent ischemia, resting ECG repolarization abnormalities, though predictive, were not specific or prognostic of CAD severity; in these cases, exercise and pharmacologic TLS, a noninvasive and sensitive cardiovascular test, may be of great interest in diagnosis of CAD, allowing adequate cardiac management before, during, and after pancreas transplantation. 
Surgical treatment of chronic otitis media and Meniere's syndrome. Meniere's symptom-complex in conjunction with chronic otitis media (COM) has occasionally been encountered in otologic practice. This study compares the effects of various surgical techniques on patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome, primarily on incapacitating vertigo. One group of patients with incapacitating vertigo received endolymphatic system drainage procedures, either endolymphatic sac surgery (83 patients) or cochleosacculotomy (12 patients) simultaneously with surgery for COM. Another group (14 patients) had surgery for COM only. A comparison of the results for vertigo control between the two approaches indicates a significant difference in success rate in favor of endolymphatic system drainage procedures (80% versus 20%). COM is regarded as one of the causes of endolymphatic hydrops (EH). The results of this study seem to indicate both 1. the likelihood of the cause-and-effect relationship between COM and EH, and 2. the effectiveness of endolymphatic shunting procedures on control of incapacitating vertigo, thus supporting the contentions of other authors with regard to pathogenesis and sac enhancement in patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome. 
Focal spared area in fatty liver simulating a mass. Scintigraphic evaluation. The characterization of focally spared areas in a fatty liver may at times be problematic. This report illustrates the unique diagnostic role that combined xenon-133/technetium-99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy can play in such cases. 
Effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling. We investigated the effects of electrophysiologic testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) on left ventricular systolic function and diastolic filling in 12 patients. Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was induced by programmed electrical stimulation and alternating-current, respectively. Patients were studied before and immediately after, 10 minutes after, and 1 hour after defibrillation by the AICD using M-mode, two-dimensional, and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Immediately after defibrillation, increases were found in the peak early filling velocity (70 +/- 10 cm/sec to 84 +/- 24 cm/sec, p less than 0.01), peak early-to-atrial filling velocity ratio (1.05 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.005), and maximum rate of diastolic chamber enlargement (82 +/- 26 mm/sec to 102 +/- 44 mm/sec, p less than 0.05). These changes were not evident at 10 minutes and 1 hour. Cardiac output and ejection fraction were unchanged after defibrillation. Heart rate and diastolic filling time were unchanged. We conclude that electrophysiologic testing of the AICD does not impair left ventricular function in the immediate to 1-hour period after defibrillation. Left ventricular systolic function is unchanged and diastolic filling is enhanced. 
Post-endarterectomy headache and the role of the oculosympathetic system. A study was carried out on headache after carotid endarterectomy. A specific type of headache, similar in its characteristics to "cluster headache", occurred on the operative side in 30% of 54 patients, whereas no such headache occurred after extra-intracranial bypass or peripheral vascular surgery. This postoperative headache was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it. Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy headache. Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without headache, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with headache. The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative "cluster-like" headache. 
Pouchitis--is it a wastebasket diagnosis? Pouchitis is a poorly defined syndrome that is unique to patients with an ileal reservoir. During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups. 
Broca's aphasia following damage to Wernicke's area. For or against traditional aphasiology? Classic aphasiology has been challenged by studies that have employed cranial computed tomography to test predicted anatomic-behavioral correlations. We treated a patient who developed a classic Broca's aphasia but whose computed tomographic scan revealed damage to Wernicke's area, thus seeming to contradict the principles of traditional aphasiology. However, subsequent information obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, intracarotid amobarbital (Amytal) testing, and electrophysiologic studies, including cortical stimulation, demonstrated that the brain-behavior correlations in this patient can be understood in terms of the formulations of traditional aphasiology. 
Variations in length of stay and outcomes for six medical and surgical conditions in Massachusetts and California. OBJECTIVES.--To determine the extent to which interinstitutional variations in length of stay are explained by differences in patient characteristics and to determine whether patients in hospitals with shorter lengths of stay had worse outcomes. DESIGN.--We reviewed patients' medical records and surveyed patients between 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge using a questionnaire. SETTING.--Six teaching hospitals in California and Massachusetts. PATIENTS.--A cohort of 2484 selected patients who had been hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or to rule out acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, total hip replacement, cholecystectomy, or transurethral prostatectomy. Between 73% and 84% of the patients with each condition completed a follow-up questionnaire. OUTCOME MEASURES.--In-hospital complications, deaths, length of stay, functional status after hospital discharge, readmission, and patient satisfaction with hospital care were analyzed. RESULTS.--Significant interinstitutional differences in length of stay were noted for all conditions except rule-out acute myocardial infarction. Statistical adjustment for case-mix differences accounted for most of the interinstitutional differences in length of stay for total hip replacement but explained little of the differences in the other conditions. When we controlled statistically for other predictors, length of stay did not have a significant impact on deaths, functional status after hospital discharge, the probability of readmission, or patient satisfaction with hospital care. CONCLUSION.--More research is needed to determine the medical practices that are related to variations in lengths of stay. Routinely available outcome data may help preserve quality in the face of efforts to decrease costs by effecting more standardized practices of care. 
Pancreaticobiliary ductal union. The main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct open into the second part of the duodenum alone or after joining as a common channel. A common channel of greater than 15 mm (an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct) is associated with congenital cystic dilatation of the common bile duct and carcinoma of the gall bladder. Even a long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) is associated with a higher frequency of carcinoma of the gall bladder. Gall stones smaller than the common channel and a long common channel predispose to gall stone induced acute pancreatitis. Separate openings for the two ductal systems predisposes to development of gall stones and alcohol induced chronic pancreatitis. The role of ductal union has also been investigated in primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. 
The effect of valproic acid on plasma carnitine levels. Plasma total, free, and acyl carnitine levels were determined in four groups of children: (1) those treated with valproic acid as monotherapy (n = 43), (2) those treated with valproic acid plus other antiepileptics as polytherapy (n = 91), (3) those treated with other antiepileptic drugs alone (n = 43), and (4) normal patients (n = 89). The mean free carnitine level was significantly lower in both the valproic acid monotherapy (29.9 mumol/L) and polytherapy (21.4 mumol/L) groups compared with normal subjects (36.8 mumol/L); it was also significantly lower than that in patients treated with other antiepileptic drugs (36.7 mumol/L). Comparison of valproic acid polytherapy and monotherapy yielded significantly lower free carnitine levels in the polytherapy group. The ratios of acyl to free carnitine for monotherapy (0.41) and polytherapy (0.45) were significantly higher than that in the normal group (0.25). This study indicates that a general decrease in the carnitine pool should be anticipated in patients taking valproic acid polytherapy and, to a lesser degree, monotherapy. Carnitine levels in the group taking other drugs did not differ from normal. 
A critical review of the evidence supporting a relationship between impaired fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. We critically evaluated the evidence for an association between venous thromboembolism and impaired fibrinolytic activity, as determined by global tests of fibrinolytic activity or specific tests for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor. A computer-assisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. The strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. It is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis. Whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear, since randomized clinical trials that used interventions to enhance fibrinolytic activity produced inconsistent results. 
Smoking, the oral contraceptive pill, and Crohn's disease. Both cigarette smoking and the oral contraceptive pill have been implicated as aggravating factors in Crohn's disease. Based upon the recent demonstration of multifocal gastrointestinal infarction in Crohn's disease, a possible pathogenic mechanism for this condition, we propose how smoking and the oral contraceptive pill may potentiate a tendency for focal thrombosis and hence exacerbate the activity of Crohn's disease. 
Auditory performance with simultaneous intracochlear multichannel stimulation. Different sound processing strategies are used in the various cochlear implant designs. This report presents auditory data on 35 patients implanted at the University of Utah from April 1984 to April 1989. A multichannel monopolar electrode system is inserted intracochlearly. During daily use and auditory performance testing, four electrodes receive simultaneous input. The incoming acoustic signal is amplified and routed to the different electrodes through a band-pass filter system. Mean pure-tone performances were: 500 Hz-29.6 +/- 9.4 dB; 1000 Hz-23.5 +/- 13.2 dB; 2000 Hz-25.4 +/- 9.6 dB; 4000 Hz-32.1 +/- 11.5 dB; and 6000 Hz-42.2 +/- 7.7 dB. Audio-only CID sentence testing showed 51.4% of patients scoring better than 60% and 40% scoring better than 80%. The percutaneous pedestal is well tolerated; patients have had the systems in place for 13 and 15 years. 
Effects of CO2 rebreathing on pulmonary mechanics in premature infants. The effects of hypercapnia produced by CO2 rebreathing on total pulmonary, supraglottic, and lower airway (larynx and lungs) resistance were determined in eight premature infants [gestational age at birth 32 +/- 3 (SE) wk, weight at study 1,950 +/- 150 g]. Nasal airflow was measured with a mask pneumotachograph, and pressures in the esophagus and oropharynx were measured with a fluid-filled or 5-Fr Millar pressure catheter. Trials of hyperoxic (40% inspired O2 fraction) CO2 rebreathing were performed during quiet sleep. Total pulmonary resistance decreased progressively as end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) increased from 63 +/- 23 to 23 +/- 15 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 115 +/- 82 to 42 +/- 27 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between room air (PETCO2 37 Torr) and PETCO2 of 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). Lower airway resistance (larynx and lungs) also decreased from 52 +/- 22 to 18 +/- 14 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 88 +/- 45 to 30 +/- 22 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr, respectively (P less than 0.05). Resistance of the supraglottic airway also decreased during inspiration from 7.2 +/- 2.5 to 3.6 +/- 2.5 cmH2O.l-1.s and in expiration from 7.6 +/- 3.3 to 5.3 +/- 4.7 cmH2O.l-1.s at PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). The decrease in resistance that occurs within the airway in response to inhaled CO2 may permit greater airflow at any level of respiratory drive, thereby improving the infant's response to CO2. 
Acute fetal ductal occlusion in lambs. To assess fetal right ventricular and hemodynamic responses to acute occlusion of the ductus arteriosus, the pulmonary pressure, right and left ventricular output, and right ventricular dimensions of five fetal lambs were measured with simultaneous echocardiographic monitoring. Ductal occlusion resulted in a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure, a decrease in right ventricular output of 68%, an increase in left ventricular output of 18%, and a fall in combined cardiac output of 34%. The right ventricular systolic dimension increased, and the shortening fraction decreased from 0.41 to 0.14. Tricuspid regurgitation started within two heartbeats after ductal occlusion and resolved as soon as the occlusion was released. Acute fetal ductal occlusion imposes a marked increase in the right ventricular afterload, resulting in reversible triscuspid regurgitation. 
Importance of RAA system and the treatment of patients with ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction. There is activation of the renin angiotensin system after both complicated and uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II increases myocardial oxygen consumption whilst reducing coronary flow and is also directly toxic to the myocardium. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce beneficial haemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute left ventricular failure, and may have a role in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. There is evidence to suggest that they might prevent the development of late cardiac failure by limiting the extent of post infarction ventricular dilation. Further research is necessary to define their role in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. 
Paraproteinemic corneal deposits in plasma cell myeloma. We treated two patients who had IgG-kappa-light chain monoclonal gammopathy with partially crystalline and partially amorphic corneal deposits. Impairment of vision made keratoplasty necessary for each patient. Histologic examination of the corneal specimens showed deposits that stained positively for Masson's trichrome in all corneal cells. Immunohistochemical tests identified these deposits as IgG-kappa-light chain immunoglobulin fragments. Electron microscopy showed intracellular, rhomboid-shaped deposits enveloped by a membrane. The same deposits appeared in the conjunctival epithelium, within subconjunctival fibrocytes, and in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. Immunoelectrophoresis showed IgG-kappa-light chain fragments in the blood serum, the lacrimal film, and the aqueous humor. This suggests that the intracellular immunoglobulin fragments may have entered the corneal and conjunctival epithelium by way of the lacrimal film, the keratocytes by way of the corneo-scleral limbus vasculature, and the endothelial cells from the aqueous humor. 
The necessary length of hospital stay for chronic pulmonary disease. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the necessary length of stay for patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease and to compare this with the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group system. DESIGN.--A cohort of patients were followed up prospectively after hospital admission to determine when complications, critical incidents, and the need for monitoring occurred. The medically derived necessary lengths of stay were statistically compared with the lengths of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group. Clinical factors were used to predict long vs short necessary lengths of stay. SETTING.--Two acute care hospitals: one was the principal and the other a major community teaching hospital. PATIENTS.--A consecutive sample of 83 patients who were 45 years of age or older and who required admission for treatment of chronic pulmonary disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The occurrence and time of complications, critical interventions, and monitoring. RESULTS.--After 6 days in the hospital, 90% of patients were free of complications or the need for monitoring. However, 16 days elapsed before 90% of patients had been discharged from the hospital. The length of stay that was considered necessary for care averaged 6.9 days; the actual mean length of stay was 8.7 days. The correlation between each patient's ideal length of stay and the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group was low and was not statistically significant. Three clinical variables at the time of admission (high PCO2 levels, symptoms that were present for more than 1 day, and antibiotic treatment) were associated with the need for longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS.--The medically required length of stay for patients with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease was between 6 and 7 days, on average. This length of stay, which was based on clinical events, differs from the length of stay that was calculated as a statistical norm by the diagnosis related group system. Clinical characteristics may help to identify patients who require a longer length of stay. 
Isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase in epileptic patients receiving carbamazepine monotherapy. The effects of carbamazepine monotherapy were investigated in 20 female and 21 male epileptic patients to determine whether treatment would induce an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a known effect of many anticonvulsant drugs. Serum total ALP activity was increased in nine out of the 41 patients (22%), serum bone ALP activity was increased in 10 (24%), and serum non-bone ALP activity was increased in three (7%). There was no significant difference when the mean of the patients' serum total ALP was compared with that of the controls. Twenty per cent of the patients with increased serum bone ALP had normal serum total ALP, indicating that increased serum bone isoenzyme activity may precede an increase in the total enzyme activity. This should be considered when interpreting results of increased total ALP in epileptic patients. 
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate: biopsy to whole mount. Denver VA experience. Clinical understaging abounds in adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The preoperative prostate-specific antigen is not useful in preoperative staging, although enzymatic acid phosphatase elevation is associated with positive nodes in two-thirds of patients. Whole mount evaluation of radical prostatectomy specimens reveals tumor multicentricity in more than half the patients and tumor extension beyond the prostatic capsule in the majority of patients. A significant number of patients have a final tumor grade higher than that initially assigned. Capsule penetration by tumor is a factor of tumor grade as is volume. 
Drug-induced esophagitis. Drug-induced esophagitis is being recognized increasingly in the past few years. We have reviewed 175 cases with a view to classifying this disease based on pathology. Drug-induced esophageal injury tends to occur at the anatomical site of narrowing, with the middle third behind the left atrium predominating. The disease is classified broadly into two groups. The first group is transient and self-limiting, as exemplified by tetracycline- and emepronium-induced injury (57.3%). The second is the persistent esophagitis group, often with stricture with two distinct entities: 1) patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents whose injury is aggravated by gastroesophageal reflux (26.2%) (reflux aggravated), and 2) patients with potassium chloride and quinidine sulfate-induced injury (16.2%) (persisting drug injury). We report a case that highlights the pathophysiology (delayed transit, persisting potassium within the stricture) of this type of injury which is not reflux aggravated. 
Cervical human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and cytologic evaluations in gynecologic outpatients. We studied the prevalence and cytologic manifestations of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid among 2668 gynecologic outpatients. The study population consisted of 1573 women who came into the emergency room, 623 women from an abortion clinic who were seen because of induced first-trimester abortion, and 472 women who had been referred to a colposcopy clinic because of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear finding. A dot blot technique was used for the detection of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. The prevalence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was 4.4% in the emergency room population, 8.8% in the abortion clinic population, and 31.4% in the colposcopy clinic population. Human papillomavirus type 16/18 was most prevalent (3.5%), followed by human papillomavirus type 31/33/35 (3.1%), and human papillomavirus type 6/11 was least prevalent (2.1%). Of all unselected human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women who were enrolled from the emergency room or from the abortion clinic, 73% had normal cytologic evaluations. Twenty-five percent had benign atypia, and 2% had dyskaryotic changes. No human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid type-specific differences were detected in the distribution of cytologic atypias. 
Gastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies. Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach. They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal "lipomata" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma. 
Clinicopathologic observations in essential tremor: report of six cases. Essential tremor (ET) is the most common pathologic tremor, but only eight cases have been studied pathologically. We report detailed clinical and neuropathologic studies of six additional patients. We did not find any neuropathologic lesions that might be specific for ET. Moreover, there were no abnormalities of the substantia nigra consistent with Parkinson's disease. The neuropathologic substrate of ET remains unknown. 
Ossifying fibroma in the sylvian fissure: case report. A rare case of an ossifying fibroma that developed in the sylvian fissure is reported here. During surgery, branches of the middle cerebral artery were encased in osseous tumor. The encased branches were divided and reanastomosed after the mass was removed. Postoperative angiograms demonstrated patency of the anastomosed arteries and a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed no infarction distal to the arterial anastomoses. The authors recommend division and anastomosis of the encased arteries rather than partial removal of tumor from around the encased arteries, resulting in residual tumor being left behind. 
Neurological and neuropathological sequelae of correction of chronic hyponatremia. The effect of correction of chronic hyponatremia at different rates was studied in 91 rats maintained at a plasma [Na+] of 112 +/- 1 mmol/liter for 19 +/- 1 days. Hyponatremia was corrected into normal ranges (140 to 145 mmol/liter) using three different methods. Rats corrected by water restriction achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 2.1 +/- 0.2 day and had a maximal (4 hr) correction rate of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by water diuresis achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 1.6 +/- 0.1 day and had a maximal correction rate of 2.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by hypertonic saline infusion achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 5.4 +/- 0.3 hr and had a maximal correction rate of 5.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter.hr. A fourth control group was not corrected. No demyelinative lesions were found in the brains from the uncorrected rats, whereas the occurrence of such lesions in the brains of the corrected rats was highly correlated with the maximal rate of increase in plasma [Na+] (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001), and to a lesser degree with the magnitude of the increase in plasma [Na+] over the first 24 hours of correction (r = 0.41, P less than 0.001). Brain myelinolysis was first observed in animals whose maximal (4 hr) rate of correction exceeded 1.75 mmol/liter.hr, and the incidence of demyelination increased progressively in rats with more rapid rates of correction. Similarly, myelinolysis was first observed in rats whose magnitude of correction at 24 hours exceeded 16 mmol/liter and also increased in rats with larger 24 hour magnitudes of correction. 
Changes in standard electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation predictive of successful reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction. The ability of the electrocardiographic ST segment to predict successful reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy remains controversial. To evaluate whether angiographically determined reperfusion could be predicted from changes in ST-segment elevation, the sum of ST-segment elevation in affected leads of the electrocardiogram was compared before and after thrombolytic therapy in 53 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reperfusion status of the infarct-related artery was determined angiographically less than 8 hours from onset of symptoms. According to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) criteria, 33 patients had successful reperfusion (TIMI grade 2 to 3 flow) after thrombolytic therapy and 20 patients did not (TIMI grade 0 to 1 flow). Logistic multiple regression analysis showed that the proportional value for the shift in the sum of ST elevation, termed the "% ST change," was more strongly associated with reperfusion than the absolute measured difference in millimeters (chi-square = 11.34 vs 9.22). The entire spectra of sensitivities and specificities were determined to identify a level of the percent ST change with simultaneous high sensitivity and specificity. A 20% decrease in ST elevation provided such a level (88% sensitivity, 80% specificity). The positive and negative predictive values of a 20% decrease in ST elevation were 88 and 80%, respectively. These results suggest that a decrease of only 20% in the sum of ST elevation in the standard electrocardiogram after thrombolytic therapy is a useful noninvasive predictor of reperfusion status in patients with evolving AMI. 
Hypersensitivity myocarditis. Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions. 
A phase I, II study of high-dose 5-fluorouracil and high-dose leucovorin with low-dose phosphonacetyl-L-aspartic acid in patients with advanced malignancies. Twenty-eight patients with refractory advanced malignancies were treated with a 24-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA) weekly. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable to assess toxicity and antitumor activity. The PALA was administered as an intravenous bolus over 15 minutes at a fixed dose (250 mg/m2) 24 hours before the start of the 5-FU and leucovorin infusions. Initially the dose of 5-FU was 750 mg/m2; this was increased incrementally to 2600 mg/m2. The LV was administered in a fixed dose of 500 mg/m2 concurrently with the 5-FU over a 24-hour period. This regimen was repeated weekly. Diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting were among the dose-limiting toxicities. Others were hand-foot syndrome, hair loss of the scalp and eyelashes, overall weakness, rhinitis, and chemical conjunctivitis. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in this combination and schedule was 2600 mg/m2. Seven of 14 patients treated with 2600 mg/m2 were able to tolerate the chemotherapy on a weekly basis without interruption. The other seven patients required dose reductions, but most received 5-FU at a dose of 2100 mg/m2. Twenty-three of 27 patients were treated previously. Eight patients had a partial response; five of these were treated previously. A complete response was observed in one patient with pancreatic carcinoma, previously untreated. The overall response rate for patients treated with 2100 or 2600 mg/m2 of 5-FU was nine of 18 patients (50%). Three of four previously untreated patients with pancreatic cancer responded to this treatment (two responded partially, and one had a complete response). One of three heavily pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer had a partial response as did a patient with breast cancer. Four of ten patients with colorectal cancer responded to the treatment (four partial responses), of whom three had been treated previously. 
Endoscopic removal of inflammatory fibroid polyps of the stomach. Three cases of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp removed by endoscopic polypectomy are reported. All lesions were located in the gastric antrum or prepyloric region, and their depth was restricted to the submucosa. The correct diagnosis was obtained, and the digestive symptoms disappeared after polypectomy. In contrast to observations in previous reports, we believe these lesions are suitable for removal by endoscopic means, provided they are small in size and strictly submucosal in location. 
Meningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. 
Therapeutic defibrination with ancrod does not protect canine myocardium from reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether normal fibrinogen contributes to the development of myocardial reperfusion injury by acting as a substrate in vivo for neutrophil adhesion. This was tested in a dog model of acute myocardial infarction that used pentobarbital anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 min regional myocardial ischemia and 5 h reperfusion. Dogs were treated with 1 unit/kg Ancrod (venom from the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma) or vehicle i.v. 60 min after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Therapeutic defibrination was verified in Ancrod-treated dogs by measurements of clottable fibrinogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen, by the activated partial thromboplastin time and by immunoelectrophoresis. Fibrinogen was depleted to below detectable limits of the assay (less than 0.05 mg/ml) after treatment with Ancrod. The defibrination effect was accomplished by the expected activation of the fibrinolytic system: alpha-2 antiplasmin was decreased by 10% and plasminogen activity was decreased by 30% with Ancrod treatment. There were no measureable differences between the two treatment groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate pressure product or circumflex coronary blood flow throughout the 90 min of regional ischemia or during the 5 h of reperfusion. The relative severity of ischemia between the two treatment groups was similar when assessed with radiolabeled microsphere measurement of myocardial blood flow. The accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) within the myocardium after reperfusion was not reduced by prior depletion of fibrinogen. 
Presence of PAF-acether in stool of patients with pouch ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis. Platelet-activating factor is an endogenous phospholipid produced by a wide variety of inflammatory cells. Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir. 
Chronic perineal pain related to sacral meningeal cysts. Chronic perineal pain is an often encountered problem that is difficult to evaluate. Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required. 
Treatment of posterior urethral strictures with a titanium urethral stent. A total of 5 patients with recurrent posterior urethral strictures underwent endoscopic placement of an expandable endourethral stent made of titanium. Patient age ranged from 17 to 66 years (mean age 42.6 years). Followup ranged from 13 to 20 months (mean 14.1 months). Of the patients 4 presently have unobstructed voiding with no incontinence. To date no side effects have been directly related to the stents and no incrustations or calculi have formed. Our preliminary study supports the use of titanium urethral stents as an alternative form of treatment for selected urethral strictures. 
Low-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. 
Haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade complicating pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. A case of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis complicated by haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade is reported. This was successfully managed by creating a subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal window. 
Feasibility of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia in a small community hospital. The first 6-mo experience of a two-physician APS using primarily epidural morphine in a community hospital is presented. After-hours anesthesia coverage was from home. The only monitoring was by nursing service observation. Complications occurred at incidences comparable to larger studies. Using the precautions outlined in the text, complications were appropriately diagnosed and treated despite the lack of 24-h in-house anesthesia coverage. 
Pain and impairment beliefs in chronic low back pain: validation of the Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS). Few validated instruments are available to assess beliefs and attitudes that patients have regarding pain, or ability to function despite discomfort. The Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS) was developed to tap these important beliefs and attitudes in chronic pain patients. Preliminary data indicate that the PAIRS is internally consistent and significantly related to impairment in a highly selected pain clinic sample of patients, including some chronic low back pain patients. The present study was designed to extend the validation of the PAIRS to a more general sample of chronic benign low back pain patients. Furthermore, additional tests supported the discriminant, convergent and divergent validity, as well as the reliability and relative independence from favorable self-report response bias of the PAIRS, by respectively demonstrating that: (1) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS were more prominent in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients than in matched non-pain, healthy controls; (2) scores on the PAIRS were significantly related to measures of physical impairment, but not to physicians ratings of disease severity; (3) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS are readily distinguishable from cognitive distortions and emotional distress; (4) PAIRS scores for chronic low back pain patients are relatively consistent over time; and (5) PAIRS scores are not significantly associated with measures of favorable self-report response bias. We conclude that the PAIRS has demonstrated at least preliminary utility for applications by researchers and clinicians interested in chronic pain. 
Confirmation of the efficacy of hepatic tissue iron index in differentiating genetic haemochromatosis from alcoholic liver disease complicated by alcoholic haemosiderosis. The hepatic tissue iron index proposed by Bassett et al was evaluated in 35 patients with homozygous genetic haemochromatosis, 67 patients with alcoholic liver disease, and 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease with and without cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis hepatic tissue iron concentration reliably differentiated alcoholic liver disease from genetic haemochromatosis. Although mean iron concentration was greater in patients with prefibrotic haemochromatosis than in those with prefibrotic alcoholic liver disease, some overlap occurred and complete differentiation of the two conditions was not possible. This overlap was particularly evident in some young patients with haemochromatosis in whom the tissue iron concentration grade fell in the range commonly seen in alcoholic haemosiderosis. Inability to differentiate early genetic haemochromatosis from alcoholic liver disease complicated by haemosiderosis was also a problem with standard Perls's staining. When the hepatic tissue iron index was calculated (hepatic tissue iron concentration/patient's age in years), clear differentiation of genetic haemochromatosis from both alcoholic liver disease and other forms of chronic liver disease was obtained in both cirrhotic and precirrhotic patients. This study confirms that the hepatic tissue iron index is a useful means of differentiating patients with genetic haemochromatosis from those with alcoholic liver disease. We suggest that biochemical estimation of tissue iron concentration and calculation of the tissue iron index in all patients in whom genetic haemochromatosis is a possible diagnosis will reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosing this as alcoholic liver disease. 
Intralesional interferon gamma treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are characterized by excessive collagen formation. Interferon gamma is a lymphokine that can down-regulate collagen synthesis in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, has potential therapeutic benefit in the management of abnormal scars. Intralesional scar injections of interferon gamma were performed to determine the tolerance toxicity and to obtain preliminary evidence for the efficacy of this treatment in the management of hypertropic and keloid lesions. All scars decreased in linear dimensions and flattened out. Five of 10 scars studied decreased at least 50% in linear dimensions. Interferon gamma can safely be administered intralesionally once per week up to a dosage of 0.05 mg for 10 weeks with no serious toxic effects. The commonest reported side effect was a mild headache. 
Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Postoperative deficits and functional recovery following removal of tumors involving the dominant hemisphere supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a region located within each cerebral hemisphere at the posterior mesial border of the frontal lobe adjacent to the falx. The functional significance of this area has been somewhat unclear, and information regarding its influence on motor output has largely been based on evoked responses to direct stimulation in primates and humans. In this series of patients with primary and metastatic tumors involving the dominant hemisphere SMA, a distinct pattern of postoperative deficits and recovery has emerged which emphasizes the role of this critical area in the initiation of motor activity, including speech. Based upon this analysis, ablation of this region after first identifying the primary motor cortex may be accomplished without risk of permanent loss of motor activity or speech function, despite the initial severe deficits. 
The relationship between autoantibodies and intrauterine growth retardation in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Abnormal levels of autoantibodies have recently been demonstrated in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and patients whose fetuses have intrauterine growth retardation. We determined total immunoglobulin levels (immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A) and a broad panel of autoantibodies (six antiphospholipid, four antihistone, and four antipolynucleotide antibodies) in 50 normotensive pregnant females, 19 patients with preeclampsia, and 18 patients with chronic hypertension to examine the relationship to intrauterine growth retardation. Mothers who were delivered of infants with intrauterine growth retardation demonstrated significantly more autoantibody abnormalities in the two hypertensive groups and in the normotensive control group as compared with patients delivered of appropriately grown infants. The most frequently observed autoantibody abnormalities were antiphospholipid antibodies and the most frequently observed among those were immunoglobulin G isotypes. Total immunoglobulin levels in both hypertensive and normotensive groups were identical. These results suggest a close association between the degree of B-cell activation and both severity of hypertensive diseases and development of intrauterine growth retardation in their offspring. 
Emergency treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator of pulmonary embolism in a pregnant woman with antithrombin III deficiency. Thromboembolic complications during pregnancy are frequent in patients with congenital antithrombin III deficiency. We report on a 29-year-old patient with congenital antithrombin III deficiency and severe pulmonary embolism treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency is retrospective. This case indicates that the risk of thrombolytic therapy in this clinical setting might have been overemphasized. 
Tobacco, alcohol, and coffee and cancer of the pancreas. A population-based, case-control study in Quebec, Canada. A population-based, case-control study of pancreatic cancer was carried out in greater Montreal between 1984 and 1988. A total of 179 cases and 239 population-based controls were interviewed. This study was part of the SEARCH program of the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization. A strong positive association was observed between total cigarette smoking and risk of pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 7.83). The OR for current smokers in the highest quintile of number of cigarettes was 5.15 compared with 3.99 for exsmokers. Those who consumed alcohol were in general at lower risk than nondrinkers. Coffee drinkers were collectively at lower risk than nondrinkers, particularly when coffee was consumed with meals, not on empty stomach. 
Induction of T helper cell unresponsiveness to antigen by macrophages from schistosomal egg granulomas. A basis for immunomodulation in schistosomiasis? The present studies were undertaken in an effort to understand the role of mononuclear phagocytes in the regulation of the T cell-mediated granulomatous inflammatory response in experimental murine schistosomiasis mansoni. We report that macrophages from schistosomal egg granulomas did not efficiently stimulate, but rather induced marked proliferative unresponsiveness to Ag in an IL-2-producing, I-Ek-restricted, CD4+ Th cell clone specific for pigeon cytochrome c. The unresponsive state of the T cells was achieved after incubation with granuloma macrophages in the presence of the specific Ag fragment 81-104, but not with either of them independently, and was, similarly, restricted by the I-Ek molecule. Equivalent amounts of peritoneal macrophages from schistosome-infected, but not from normal mice, were also effective in inducing T cell unresponsiveness. We postulate that granuloma macrophages, and potentially other accessory cells in schistosome-infected individuals, are similarly capable of inducing anergy in egg Ag-specific Th cells, and that the resulting inhibited T cell reactivity, which translates into failure of lymphokine secretion and of clonal expansion, represents a major basis of the immunologic down-regulation (immunomodulation) of granulomatous hypersensitivity, characteristically seen in this disease. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Repression of the interferon signal transduction pathway by the adenovirus E1A oncogene. The signal transduction pathway initiated by type I interferon (alpha and beta interferons) is inhibited by expression of the adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene. Cotransfection analyses with the E1A oncogene and an interferon-stimulated reporter gene show that mutations within an amino-terminal domain of the E1A oncoprotein are defective in transcriptional repression. Cotransfection experiments also revealed that the transcriptional repression is mediated through the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) found within the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes. Since interferon treatment activates a latent cytoplasmic DNA-binding factor that can recognize the ISRE and subsequently stimulate transcription, the appearance of this factor was analyzed in a cell line that constitutively expresses the E1A oncogene. The DNA binding activity of this transcriptional activator was found to be inhibited in the E1A-expressing cell line. In vitro cytoplasmic mixing experiments with extracts from control and E1A-expressing cells identified a specific component of this multimeric transcription factor to be defective. 
Acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy. We studied 13 patients with supranuclear lower cranial nerve ("pseudobulbar" or "suprabulbar") palsy of acute onset. While seven patients had had a prior stroke, six patients had no history of stroke. Eight patients experienced a complete bilateral supranuclear lower cranial nerve palsy, which was isolated in five patients and associated with hemiplegia and with hemiparesis in three patients. Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course. 
Adnexal torsion. An unusual cause of abdominal pain in postmenopausal women. Adnexal torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain in older women. Because the presenting symptoms and signs are vague, the diagnosis is not often considered. Lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting are usual in patients with torsion. Ultrasonography or computed tomography are useful diagnostic tests. Two case reports of older patients with adnexal torsion are presented to emphasize the diagnostic features of this entity, including lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal mass. Although the condition is uncommon, adnexal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. 
Value and limitations of color Doppler echocardiography in the evaluation of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty for isolated mitral stenosis. The limitations of 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography in patients undergoing mitral valvuloplasty are well known. This study was undertaken to assess the value of color Doppler flow imaging in 36 symptomatic mitral stenosis patients who subsequently underwent successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty by comparing the results to those obtained at cardiac catheterization. Color Doppler-guided conventional Doppler assessment agreed well with cardiac catheterization results in classifying mitral stenosis as mild, moderately severe and severe, both before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler was also useful in identifying patients who had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler flow mapping was more sensitive than oximetry in the detection of iatrogenic atrial septal defects, which were noted in 25 patients. The defects of those patients with smaller defects by color Doppler (diameter less than 0.7 cm) or echocardiographic shunt volume less than 0.7 liters/min tended to close, usually within 6 months, as opposed to those with larger defects or higher shunt volumes, which tended to persist. Echocardiographic shunt volumes revealed a fair correlation with oximetric results. 
Stricture disease: radiology of urethral stents. Self-expanding metal stents are emerging as an effective alternative treatment in the management of urethral obstruction. The radiologic studies of 33 men with anterior urethral strictures (subprostatic, n = 11; bulbar, n = 22) that had recurred despite repeated optical urethrotomy and dilation were reported. In all patients, the stricture was successfully treated with stent insertion. Urethrography performed 1 month later in 19 patients showed an irregular intrastent lumen of varying degrees due to a hyperplastic urothelial reaction confirmed at endoscopy the same day. Available follow-up urethrograms in seven patients at 3 months showed that the hyperplasia was settling, and by 6 months, the intrastent lumen was smooth and of good caliber. Urethrography revealed postoperative structures in 14 patients. Strictures seen at 1 month (n = 6) were due to initial stent misplacement and were treated with the insertion of a second stent. Strictures seen 3 months after insertion (n = 4) occurred within the stent lumen and were considered to be significant at endoscopy in only one patient. Strictures that developed 6-12 months after stent insertion (n = 4) were not within the stent and were considered to represent genuine new strictures. 
Acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria and angioedema are clinical manifestations of various immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, or they may be idiopathic. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the cardiovascular system may be involved in any combination. Patients with urticaria and/or angioedema can be classified based on pathophysiologic mechanisms into those with IgE-dependent or complement-mediated immunologic disorders, those with nonimmunologic disorders in which there is a direct effect on the mast cell or on arachidonic acid metabolism, and those whose condition is idiopathic. Evaluation of patients should focus on a thorough history. Laboratory tests provide minimal additional information. About one half of patients with urticaria alone and 25% with urticaria and angioedema or angioedema alone are free of lesions within 1 year. With urticaria, angioedema, or both, 20% of patients experience episodes for more than 20 years. 
Hematologic effects of stem cell factor in vivo and in vitro in rodents. Recombinant rat stem cell factor (rrSCF) administered to rats as a single intravenous injection causes a dose-dependent neutrophilia and lymphocytosis as well as the appearance of immature myeloid cells and occasional blast cells in the circulation. Neutrophilia begins at 2 hours, peaks at 4 to 6 hours, and subsides between 12 and 24 hours. Lymphocytosis occurs at 0.5 hours and has subsided by 2 hours. rrSCF-induced neutrophilia and lymphocytosis are abrogated by boiling, demonstrating that endotoxin-contamination of the rrSCF preparation is not responsible for the observed hematologic effects. The bone marrow at 6 hours after injection of rrSCF shows a left-shifted myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia as evidenced by significant increases in the absolute numbers of morphologically recognizable early myeloid and erythroid precursors. A concurrent decrease in the absolute numbers of mature marrow neutrophils is noted, suggesting that the release of marrow neutrophils contributes to the peripheral neutrophilia. After 2 weeks of daily injections of rrSCF, bone marrow smears demonstrate a remarkable mast cell hyperplasia accompanied by a decrease in total marrow cellularity and by a striking erythroid and lymphoid hypoplasia. rrSCF also causes mast cells to appear in the circulation and causes a systemic increase in embryonic connective tissue-type, but not mucosal-type, mast cells. In vitro long-term culture of lineage-depleted mouse bone marrow cells with rrSCF results in an almost pure outgrowth of mast cells. 
Cervicofacial cystic hygroma. Patterns of recurrence and management of the difficult case. Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively. Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas. 
Multisystem failure and hepatic microvesicular fatty metamorphosis associated with tolmetin ingestion. Multisystem toxicity including both renal and hepatic failure has been reported with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a fatal case of multisystem failure associated with tolmetin ingestion in a 15-year-old girl. Microvesicular fatty change was found in the liver at autopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated multisystem failure to have this histopathologic finding. 
Maximal sniff mouth pressure compared with maximal inspiratory pressure in acute respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle strength most often is better reflected by sniff Pes than PImax against occlusion. Furthermore, sniff Pes can be estimated noninvasively by the measurement of sniff Pmo in normal subjects and in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. The aim of this study was to compare sniff Pmo and P.PImax to assess inspiratory muscle strength in patients with acute respiratory failure. The highest pressure was produced by P.PImax in 61 percent of measurements, and by sniff Pmo in 39 percent. Above 35 cm H2O P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 55 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 1.20 +/- 0.54. Below 35 cm H2O, P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 75 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 0.76 +/- 0.35 (p less than 0.02). Thus, measurements of sniff Pmo and P.PImax complement one another for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. However, sniff Pmo underestimates inspiratory muscle strength in patients with severe inspiratory muscle weakness. 
Lightning and its effects on the auditory system. Patients struck by lightning can present with a wide variety of unusual otologic problems including burns to the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane rupture, middle ear injury, and sensorineural hearing loss. Four patients who incurred various otologic problems, including one patient with previously unreported bilateral oval window fistulas following lightning injury, are presented. Audiologic, otologic, and surgical findings are reviewed as well as patient follow-up and outcome. 
Isovolumic relaxation sound: a new class of added heart sound? An early diastolic sound in a patient with apical left ventricular disease is reported. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography showed blood flow within the left ventricular cavity during the isovolumic relaxation period whose peak flow velocity was synchronous with the onset of this diastolic sound. Because it occurred before filling started it could not have been either a third or fourth heart sound. It must thus represent a distinct and apparently unrecognised class of diastolic sound. 
Clinical correlation with serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in Guillain-Barre syndrome. In patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were elevated compared with those of patients with other neurologic diseases (OND), and of healthy controls. Smaller increases in sIL-2R levels occurred in OND patients compared to healthy subjects. Monitoring of GBS patients clearly demonstrated that decreases in sIL-2R levels correlated with clinical recovery. Thus, T-cell activation may be relevant in the pathogenesis of GBS. 
Effect of triple therapy (antibiotics plus bismuth) on duodenal ulcer healing. A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection accelerates the healing of duodenal ulcers. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and five patients with endoscopically verified duodenal ulcers. INTERVENTION: Patients received either ranitidine, 300 mg/d, or ranitidine, 300 mg/d, plus "triple therapy" (2 g/d of tetracycline, 750 mg/d of metronidazole, and 5 or 8 bismuth subsalicylate tablets per day). Triple therapy was administered for only the first 2 weeks of ulcer treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Videoendoscopic assessment of ulcer status was done until ulcer healing was complete. Evaluations were done after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of therapy. MAIN RESULTS: Ulcer healing was more rapid in patients receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy than in patients receiving ranitidine alone (P less than 0.01). The cumulative percentages of patients with healed ulcers in the group receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy and in the group receiving ranitidine alone were as follows: 37% and 18% after week 2; 74% and 53% after week 4; 84% and 68% after week 8; 96% and 80% after week 12; and 98% and 84% after week 16. CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with anti-H. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. Our results indicate that H. pylori plays a role in duodenal ulcer disease. 
Heart rate variability and cardiac autonomic function in men with chronic alcohol dependence. Cardiac autonomic function was studied in 23 alcohol dependent men by standard tests of autonomic function and measurement of 24 hour heart rate variability. In all there was peripheral or central nervous system damage or both. Standard tests of autonomic function showed vagal neuropathy in seven. The remainder had normal autonomic function tests. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was measured as the standard deviation of the successive differences between RR intervals from an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was significantly lower in both alcohol dependent groups than in controls, but the results in the two alcohol dependent groups were not significantly different from each other. The results of standard tests of autonomic function did not distinguish between the alcohol dependent men with normal autonomic function and controls. The differences in heart rate variability between this group and the controls may have been the result of the ability of this method to detect small changes in autonomic integrity. Cardiomyopathy may also account for some of these differences and such abnormalities should be excluded before results are to be regarded as a reflection of vagal function. Twenty four hour measurement of heart rate variability may be a more useful index of cardiac vagal neuropathy than currently available tests of autonomic function. 
The role of serotonin (5HT2) receptor blockade in myocardial reperfusion injury: effects of LY53857 in a canine model of myocardial infarction. The potential protective effects of serotonin receptor antagonism during the process of acute myocardial infarction were studied in anesthetized male dogs, which were subjected to a 90-min left circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by 5 h of reperfusion. Either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist LY53857 was infused i.v. at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a constant infusion of 2 mg/kg/min beginning 5 min before left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and continuing throughout the duration of the ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Verification of functional 5HT2 receptor antagonism in the circulating blood of the LY53857-treated dogs was monitored throughout the experiments by periodic assessment of ex vivo platelet reactivity to exogenous serotonin. After 5 h of reperfusion, the hearts were excised and analyzed utilizing histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium, which demarcates myocardial infarct size and anatomical area of myocardium at risk of infarction. There was not a significant reduction of infarct size with LY53857 treatment: control infarct/area at risk = 38.6 +/- 4.7%, n = 9 LY53857 infarct/area at risk = 33.4 +/- 3.8%, n = 6. Similarly, when myocardial infarct size was analyzed as a function of myocardial collateral blood flow, there were no significant effects of drug treatment on the relationship between collateral blood flow and infarct size. The effects of 5HT on neutrophil activation were determined by measuring the potential ability of 5HT to enhance the chemotactic peptide-induced production of superoxide. 5HT did not activate human neutrophils in vitro and LY53857 had no effect on neutrophil superoxide production. 
A rat model of acute liver necrosis induced by a monoclonal antibody to liver-specific antigen and complement. Acute massive hepatic injury was induced in rats by a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific membrane antigen, and its histological characteristics were investigated. A single intravenous injection of murine ascites containing a monoclonal antibody produced numerous hemorrhagic foci of degenerated and necrotic liver cells predominantly in zones 1 (the periportal area) and 2 (the area of transition between the periportal zone and the perivenular zone) of the liver lobule within 10 min. Massive hepatocellular necroses were observed 1 hr later, but no inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in and around the necrotic foci. Immunohistological study demonstrated marked deposition of the third component of the complement system in the necrotic area. Serum complement activity was sharply decreased immediately after the injection of the antibody, suggesting that the hepatic necrosis is ascribable to a complement-mediated immune attack on the liver cell membrane induced by the antigen-antibody reaction. The hepatic necrosis in response to monoclonal-antibody injection did not progress to a chronic disease and healed almost completely, changing to scar tissues within 2 wk. Although it is not clear whether this hepatic injury has any clinical relevance, this antibody/complement model may be useful for investigating the cause and therapy of hepatic diseases such as fulminant hepatitis. 
Residual tumor discovered in routine second transurethral resection in patients with stage T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. When a second transurethral resection was routinely performed 8 to 14 days after the initial transurethral resection in 46 patients for stage T1 bladder tumors residual disease was found in 20 despite the surgical report of complete resection in 40. In only 13 patients was residual tumor noted at repeat resection by the senior urologist performing the operation and residual tumor was confirmed histologically in 10 of them. The extent of the lesion is easily misjudged even by experienced surgeons. Early cystoscopy cannot exclude residual tumor. Residual tumor is an important cause of early recurrence and repeat resection of stage T1 lesions is recommended. 
Recurrent malacoplakia of the female urethra. Malacoplakia, a rare inflammatory lesion, afflicts the genitourinary system in most cases. A 22-year-old women had a recurrence of urethral malacoplakia that had been excised 5 years earlier. The recurrence was accompanied by staphylococcal infection in the urinary tract. The pathological specimens in both instances had the features typical of malacoplakia with von Hansemann cells and Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. 
Recurrent haemospermia--underlying urogenital anomalies and efficacy of imaging procedures. Recurrent haemospermia is often regarded as "essential". Following routine diagnostic procedures, we found an associated factor in 54 of 72 patients (75%). With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed. Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed. Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role. Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%). In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension. 
Viral persistence in neurons explained by lack of major histocompatibility class I expression. Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules. 
Adverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. 
Opercular cheiro-oral syndrome. Perioral and distal upper limb sensory dysfunction (cheiro-oral syndrome) has classically been attributed to cortical involvement. In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon. 
Determinants of one-year outcome from balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) has been a therapeutic alternative treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Previous studies have been unable to predict 1-year outcome because of limited acute and follow-up clinical, invasive and echocardiographic data. The purpose of this study was to predict long-term outcome based on comprehensive data obtained at the time of valvuloplasty and at 3 and 6 months after the procedure. Of 170 consecutive patients undergoing BAV, 108 (mean age 78 years) were at least 1 year from their procedure. Prospective clinical, micromanometer hemodynamic, digital ventriculographic and echocardiographic/Doppler data were collected at baseline and immediately after the procedure. Echocardiographic data were also obtained at 3 and 6 months. With use of Cox model analysis, major events (defined as cardiac death [n = 30], aortic valve replacement [n = 21] or repeat BAV [n = 13]) were predicted by advanced age, baseline heart failure class, and baseline echocardiographic-determined diastolic left ventricular diameter. Only baseline left ventricular ejection fraction proved to be a significant predictor of cardiac death (p = 0.002) in a multivariate model. Absolute values after BAV (stroke work, first derivative of left ventricular pressure, valve area, end-systolic volume, Fick cardiac output, transvalvular gradient) and acute changes measured by catheterization or echocardiography did not provide additional predictive information over that of post procedure ejection fraction. Similarly, echocardiographic valve area and transvalvular gradient at 3 months added no further prognostic data. With an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45% (n = 63), cardiac survival at 1 year was 80%, irrespective of age, sex, congestive heart failure class or severity of coronary artery disease. 
The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomotic complications in lung transplantation. The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomosis complications have been assessed in a series of 53 patients undergoing lung transplantation. Of the 50 patients subsequently at risk of airway complications, these problems occurred in seven (14%). Only one patient died as a direct result of the airway complication (2%). Four patients required airway stenting, and their management is discussed. Although airway healing is normal in the majority of patients undergoing lung transplantation (86%), when deficits occur they can usually be successfully managed with conservative treatment. Bronchial stenting may be required on either a temporary or a permanent basis. 
A limitation of endoscopic ultrasound: an unusual case of early gastric cancer overlying a pancreatic rest. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been developed as a valuable tool for examining the depth of carcinoma invasion and evaluating the submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In the present case, that of a 60-yr-old woman, the work-up of radiography and conventional endoscopy revealed an ulcerating cancer of the stomach. Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma. 
Tibial meniscal dynamics using three-dimensional reconstruction of magnetic resonance images. The human knee joint represents a complex biomechanical system of which the menisci are an integral component. At present, little data exists describing the meniscal kinematics of the intact knee. Accordingly, a three-dimensional reconstruction magnetic resonance image model was used to explore this issue. Five fresh cadaveric knees were examined by magnetic resonance imaging throughout a full range of motion at 10 degrees intervals. Computer three-dimensional images of the menisci were generated and evaluated for anteroposterior excursion and deformation. During flexion, the posterior excursion of the medial meniscus was 5.1 mm, while that of the lateral meniscus was 11.2 mm. The anterior horn segments were shown to be more mobile than the posterior horn segments bilaterally. Prior limitations of meniscal kinematic assessment may be overcome with advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction. The menisci are highly mobile and easily deformed structures within the intact, cadaveric knee. This imaging technique may prove useful in the elucidation of meniscal dynamics. In the future, similar techniques may be applied clinically to aid in the diagnosis of joint dysfunction. 
Peer problems in Tourette's disorder. To explore the social adjustment and peer relationships of children with Tourette's disorder, 29 patients with mild to moderate Tourette's disorder were studied. Children underwent neuropsychological testing. The patients completed self-esteem scales and their parents and teachers completed behavior rating scales. Peer relationships were examined with the Pupil Evaluation Inventory, which is a sociometric questionnaire completed by the child's classmates and provides measures of aggression, withdrawal, and likability. As a group, Tourette's disorder patients were significantly more withdrawn, more aggressive, and less popular than their classmates. Thirty-five percent of the children with Tourette's disorder received the lowest rating in the class on one or more of the Pupil Evaluation Inventory factors. These social problems were not predicted by the frequency or duration of tics. A clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and teachers' ratings on the summary scale of the Child Behavior Checklist and the Pupil Evaluation Inventory did predict poor adjustment. It is concluded that social adjustment is a major difficulty for many children with Tourette's disorder, irrespective of tic severity. 
Color Doppler imaging in the management of intraocular tumors. Forty-four intraocular mass lesions were studied using a new, non-invasive ultrasound technique known as color Doppler imaging (CDI). This technique displays color-encoded Doppler flow information throughout a two-dimensional gray scale image thus providing selective analysis of Doppler spectra in small vessels using pulsed Doppler. Abnormal Doppler shifts were demonstrated within 39 neoplastic lesions studied, but Doppler shifts could not be detected in three tumor-simulating lesions. In a group of 12 choroidal melanomas studied after radiation therapy, lower Doppler shifts were seen compared with a group of 28 tumors before therapy. This change in Doppler shift may reflect the decreased vascular supply of the tumor. Color Doppler imaging may be of value as an additional useful tool in the diagnosis and management of intraocular tumors. 
Fluconazole therapy for chronic disseminated candidiasis in patients with leukemia and prior amphotericin B therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of fluconazole against chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis) in patients with leukemia in whom amphotericin B treatment had failed. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole is a safe and effective agent with significant activity against chronic disseminated candidiasis. 
Amplified expression of three jun family members inhibits erythroleukemia differentiation. Several different proto-oncogenes have been shown to influence cellular differentiation. One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression. 
The molecular basis for Duchenne versus Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of severity with type of deletion. About 60% of both Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is due to deletions of the dystrophin gene. For cases with a deletion mutation, the "reading frame" hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory, we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the "reading frame" theory in 92% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many "in-frame" deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features. 
Lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein changes after cardiac transplantation. Although lipoprotein changes after cardiac transplantation have been documented, the effects of transplantation and subsequent immunosuppressive therapy (particularly the combination of prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine) on apolipoprotein levels and lipoprotein(a) have not been reported. Fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 and lipoprotein(a) were evaluated in 69 consecutive patients during the waiting period before cardiac transplantation. There were 28 deaths before donor organ identification and 41 patients received a cardiac allograft. The lipoprotein levels of transplant recipients were again assayed 3 months postoperatively. Mean (+/- SEM) values increased for total plasma cholesterol (from 180 +/- 8 to 228 +/- 8 mg/dl, p less than or equal to 0.001), triglycerides (from 126 +/- 11 to 207 +/- 14 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.001), HDL cholesterol (from 39 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 3 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.002) and LDL cholesterol (from 119 +/- 7 to 138 +/- 7 mg/dl; p less than 0.02). Apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 also increased, but lipoprotein(a) decreased from 11.7 +/- 1.7 to 6.8 +/- 1.1 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.0001) after transplantation. Although total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 increased dramatically after cardiac transplantation, so did HDL cholesterol, thereby keeping the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio constant. The surprising decrease in lipoprotein(a) after cardiac transplantation suggests that metabolism of lipoprotein(a) is independent of LDL cholesterol and that immunosuppressive drugs either decrease the synthesis or increase catabolism of lipoprotein(a). 
Acute dependence on depressant drugs is determined by common genes in mice. Withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WRS) mice were genetically selected to express severe or mild handling-induced convulsions (HIC), respectively, after cessation of chronic ethanol (EtOH) vapor inhalation. The studies reported here tested WSP and WSR mice to determine whether elevated HIC were seen after administration of acute doses of several drugs that depress central nervous system activity. The drugs tested were EtOH, pentobarbital, t-butanol, acetaldehyde, and diazepam. All drugs initially suppressed HIC in WSP mice. This suppression was followed by an exacerbation of HIC, suggestive of a state of rebound central nervous system hyperexcitability during acute withdrawal. Susceptibility to acute withdrawal seizures was clearly under genetic control, since WSR mice did not display acute withdrawal HIC to any appreciable extent. Acute EtOH withdrawal seizures did not require testing WSP mice repeatedly, as they could be seen upon a single HIC test 8 hr after EtOH injection. Results with acetaldehyde and t-butanol suggest that the formation of acetaldehyde may be sufficient, but is not necessary for the elicitation of acute EtOH withdrawal. Earlier studies had found that WSP mice displayed more severe withdrawal HIC than WSR mice after chronic treatment with t-butanol, phenobarbital, nitrous oxide, or diazepam. The genetic predisposition to chronic EtOH withdrawal HIC in WSP mice generalized to all central nervous system depressants acutely tested, suggesting that acute and chronic withdrawal to all these drugs is largely under the control of a common group of genes. 
Reconstruction of failed lumbar surgery with narrow AO DCP plates for spinal arthrodesis. Forty-five patients underwent surgical reconstruction with transpedicular fixation of the lumbar spine with narrow AO DCP plates. Preoperatively, all patients underwent spinal imaging with either magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or myelogram as well as provocative discography to determine the location and the number of symptomatic segments. The minimum follow-up in this series was 2 years. The determination of solid posterior fusion in the presence of plate instrumentation was difficult. The patients in the series were classified as having 1) solid fusion; 2) radiographic flaws within the posterolateral fusion without implant failure; or 3) frank pseudarthrosis with implant failure. Thirty-six (80%) of the patients had a solid fusion, 9 of whom required an additional anterior interbody fusion to obtain symptom control. Twenty percent of the patients in the series had radiographic evidence of reabsorption without implant failure. Four patients in the series (8.8%) had screw breakage, three of which required anterior interbody fusions. The highest rate of reabsorption and pseudarthrosis implant failure was in the 12 patients who had three-level instrumentation; 33% of these patients required anterior interbody fusion to obtain a solid arthrodesis. The average preoperative pain scale was 8.9, and the average postoperative pain scale was a 3.3. Twenty-two patients in the series were cigarette smokers and had a slightly lower fusion rate than non-smokers. They did, however, have a higher use of narcotics after surgery. Forty percent of the patients in this series continued to have radiculopathy after their reconstruction. This study demonstrates the utility of transpedicular fixation in salvage lumbar surgery in obtaining a solid arthrodesis with a beneficial clinical result. Anterior interbody fusions are highly successful in the management of pseudarthrosis and implant failure after transpedicular instrumentation. 
Role of balloon angioplasty in the treatment of aortic coarctation. Since the initial report of coarctation balloon angioplasty in 1982, several groups have used this technique for native coarctations in neonates, infants, and children and for postoperative recoarctations. However, recommendations for use of balloon angioplasty as a treatment procedure of choice are clouded by reports of aneurysm development at the site of coarctation. Here we review our experience as well as that published in the literature, including Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital Anomalies Registry data, and present evidence in support of balloon angioplasty as a therapeutic procedure of choice for treating native and recurrent postoperative aortic coarctations. Balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctations in 20 neonates and infants 1 year old or less reduced peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation from 40 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) to 11 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); no patient required immediate surgical intervention. The residual gradient at follow-up (mean follow-up, 12 months) in 16 infants was 18 +/- 16 mm Hg, a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) compared with preangioplasty values. In none of the patients did an aneurysm develop. Recoarctation developed in 5 (31%) of the 16 infants and was successfully treated either by surgical resection (in 2) or by repeat balloon angioplasty (in 3). A comparison of mortality and recurrence rates between the balloon angioplasty and surgical groups was made with the help of data pooled from the literature published since 1980. The initial (7% versus 23%) and late (2% versus 25%) mortality and recoarctation (11% versus 18%) rates were higher (p less than 0.025) after surgical intervention than after balloon therapy. When only reports in which patients were operated on after 1979 were included in this type of analysis, the initial and late mortality rates remained higher (p less than 0.01) after operation than after angioplasty, and the recoarctation rates became similar (p greater than 0.1). Thirty-two children (greater than 1 year old) underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with a resultant reduction in peak systolic pressure gradient from 48 +/- 19 mm Hg to 10 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), which continued to remain low (14 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) at follow-up catheterization in 24 children 13 months (mean) later. There were no immediate or late deaths. A small aneurysm developed in 1 patient (4%) but did not require intervention. Recoarctation developed in 2 patients (8%), and in both, repeat balloon angioplasty was performed with good results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Relation between skin cancer and HLA antigens in renal-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. Recipients of renal allografts are at an increased risk for skin cancer. It is also known that recipients who are homozygous for HLA antigens are at an increased risk for certain cancers, as are those who are mismatched with their donors for these antigens. In a case-control study we assessed the relation between skin cancer in renal-transplant recipients and HLA homozygosity and mismatching. METHODS. Of 764 patients who received renal transplants between 1966 and 1988, 66 had squamous-cell carcinoma or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin after transplantation. HLA homozygosity was assessed in all 66 recipients, and HLA mismatching in 39; the results were compared with those in 124 recipients without skin cancer. We also investigated the relation between skin cancer and the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In separate case-control analyses we investigated the influence of exposure to the sun and keratotic skin lesions on the risk of skin cancer. RESULTS. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma was increased in recipients mismatched for HLA-B antigens; the relative risks were 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 19.0) with mismatching for one and two antigens, respectively, as compared with no mismatching. Mismatching for HLA-A or HLA-DR antigens had no effect on the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma, and there was no association between mismatches at any of the HLA loci and the occurrence of basal-cell carcinoma. The total doses of azathioprine and prednisone were not associated with the occurrence of skin cancer or with HLA matching. Exposure to sunlight and keratotic skin lesions were strongly associated with skin cancer but not with HLA mismatching. Homozygosity for HLA-DR was more frequent among the patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.6) and among patients with 100 or more keratotic skin lesions (relative risk, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 15.1). CONCLUSIONS. HLA-B mismatching is significantly associated with the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma in renal-transplant recipients, as is HLA-DR homozygosity. An indirect effect on the level of immunosuppression does not appear to explain these findings, nor does exposure to sunlight or the number of keratotic skin lesions account for this observation. 
Mortality, neoplasia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--To determine the cause of death and incidence of neoplasia in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone. DESIGN--A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS--All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS--110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0.9-57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS--Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review. 
The efficacy of chlorhexidine gel in reduction of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species in patients treated with radiation therapy. Xerostomia may develop in patients with cancer who receive radiotherapy that includes the salivary glands in the field. These patients are at high risk of rampant dental caries. Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species have been associated with dental caries. Quantitative counts of these organisms demonstrated high caries risk due to streptococci in 66% and due to lactobacilli in 100% of patients studied. Use of chlorhexidine rinse was shown to reduce S. mutans counts 1.1 logs and lactobacilli 1.1 logs. The use of chlorhexidine gel resulted in a reduction of S. mutans 1.2 logs and lactobacilli 2.2 logs. In the subjects using the rinse, caries risk due to streptococci was reduced to low levels in 44% and due to lactobacilli in only one subject, with reduction to moderate risk in one third and no change in risk in the remaining patients. The use of chlorhexidine gel was found to reduce the caries risk associated with streptococci to low levels in all patients, and the risk associated with lactobacilli to low and moderate risk in two thirds of patients. 
Intraoperative evaluation of intestinal ischemia: a comparison of methods. Methods for evaluating intestinal ischemia include standard clinical criteria, Doppler ultrasonography, and intravenous fluorescein injection. Each has disadvantages, and a combination of methods is often used. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface oximetry could be used to assess perfusion in an animal whose intestinal diameter approximates that of infants. Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines. After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed. Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model. We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion. 
Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia. The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated. There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration. Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease. 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as a primary tumor of the liver: presentation, diagnosis and outcome in eight patients. We report the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in eight patients in whom the disease was seen as a primary tumor of the liver. This series illustrates the variety of situations in which lymphoma might be diagnosed: (a) abdominal pain and hepatomegaly (three cases), (b) incidental finding at evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis (two cases), (c) secondary neoplasm after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (one case) and (d) complication of AIDS (two cases). In most cases, clinical and/or radiological features were nonspecific. However, the combination of the following features must be considered as suggestive: occurrence of an apparently primary hepatic tumor in an immunocompromised patient, absence of the usual serum tumor markers and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase activity. The final diagnosis was based on histological examination of specimens obtained by ultrasonically guided liver biopsies or at surgery. All cases belonged to unfavorable histological subtypes. Immunohistochemical findings on paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the seven tumors available for study. In the three patients without coexisting disease, complete remission was obtained by surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy. In the two patients with coexisting cirrhosis, outcome was rapidly unfavorable, with death occurring less than 3 mo after diagnosis. Among the three immunocompromised patients, two experienced a rapid unfavorable outcome, and the remaining one was in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver arising in patients without coexisting disease has a slow progression and might be successfully treated by surgery. 
Management of hyponatremic seizures in children with hypertonic saline: a safe and effective strategy. OBJECTIVE: To study efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline administration in the management of hyponatremic seizures. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study with factorial design. SETTING: In-patient population in a university hospital. PATIENTS: All children admitted with serum sodium concentrations less than 125 mmol/L. Sixty-nine episodes of severe hyponatremia in 60 children were reviewed. Forty-one of these children presented with seizures. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-five of 41 seizure patients received an iv bolus of 4 to 6 mL/kg body weight of 3% saline. Twenty-eight patients were treated with a benzodiazepine and/or phenobarbital with or without the subsequent administration of hypertonic saline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen treatment failures and ten instances of apnea occurred among the 28 patients treated with benzodiazepine/phenobarbital. Administration of hypertonic saline resulted in resolution of seizures and apnea in all cases. Those patients receiving 3% saline had a higher serum sodium increase rate from 0 to 4 hrs than the remaining patients (3.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L.hr, p less than .01). None developed subsequent neurologic deterioration or clinical manifestations of osmotic demyelination syndrome. CONCLUSION: Treatment of hyponatremic seizures with routine anticonvulsants may be ineffective and is associated with a considerable incidence of apnea. A rapid increase in the serum sodium concentration by 3 to 5 mmol/L with the use of hypertonic saline is safe and efficacious in managing acute symptomatic hyponatremia. 
Rheumatic manifestations in myelodysplastic syndromes. The myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with possible transformation to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. We describe a patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts with unusual rheumatic manifestations of vasculitis, migratory synovitis, arthralgias, and myalgias. A retrospective review over a 6-month period of 162 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes found 16 patients (10%) with several rheumatic manifestations. We divided these manifestations into 4 different categories: cutaneous vasculitis, "lupus-like syndrome," neuropathy, and patients with both a rheumatic disease and a myelodysplastic syndrome. There were 7 with cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis and other individual cases of urticarial vasculitis and panniculitis; 3 with lupus-like manifestations with histological evidence of an inflammatory process; 3 with neuropathic manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis with foot drop, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; and 3 patients in which their myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed after their rheumatic disease was known, including rheumatoid arthritis. Sjogren's syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease. The class with refractory anemia with excess blasts had 9 patients with rheumatic manifestations but also had the largest number of patients in the study (46/162 or 29%). Three of the 16 patients died, all from the refractory anemia with excess blasts class, reflecting the known mortality in this group of patients. We believe there is a significant association between myelodysplastic syndromes and rheumatic manifestations. 
Primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. The clinical and pathologic findings are reported in a case of primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. Cortical atrophy of the involved gland was present, the mechanism of which was obscure. 
Comparison of tomographic and planar imaging for the evaluation of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction using pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m sestamibi. Pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) was performed in patients who underwent thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction comparing planar imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty-one patients were injected with Tc-99m sestamibi before thrombolytic treatment. SPECT and planar imaging were acquired after completion of the treatment. The scintigraphy was repeated 5 days later in 20 subjects. Planar and SPECT studies were evaluated using an uptake score. Patients were divided according to the status of the infarct-related vessel (patent in 13 patients, group 1, and occluded in seven, group 2) and to the presence of functional recovery in serial echocardiographic controls (present in 10 patients, group A, and absent in 10, group B). The scintigraphic defect extent in the 5-day images correlated with the enzymatic infarct size: SPECT: r = 0.75, p less than 0.0002; planar: r = 0.68, p less than 0.002. The decrease of the uptake defects correlated with the reduction of the left ventricular wall asynergy (admission versus 1 month echocardiogram): SPECT: r = 0.92, p less than 0.000001; planar: r = 0.82, p less than 0.00001. The percent decrease of the uptake defects was significantly higher in patients in group 1 and group A compared with group 2 and, respectively, group B--SPECT: group 1: 51.4 +/- 27.7 versus group 2: 13.1 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.02; group A: 64.2 +/- 15.3 versus group B: 11.9 +/- 8.1, p less than 0.0002; planar group 1: 41 +/- 30.4 versus group 2: 7.7 +/- 6.2, p less than 0.05; group A: 52.5 +/- 24.3 versus group B: 6.1 +/- 6, p less than 0.0002. This study confirms the reliability of pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99m sestamibi for evaluating the outcome of thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction. The results seems slightly more accurate using SPECT, but a simple three-view planar study also gives useful data. 
Extradural haematoma after continuous extradural anaesthesia. We report a case of extradural haematoma occurring after extradural anaesthesia in an anticoagulated patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the haematoma was evacuated surgically. A search of the literature revealed only five previous reports of extradural haematoma in association with extradural anaesthesia. 
Deficiencies in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody measurement in myasthenia gravis. In a retrospective case note study of 86 patients with myasthenia gravis, 60 had an anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody assay performed by the regional immunology laboratory. Antibody was detected in 38% which compares with 66-93% in other series. Whilst the use of staphylococcal protein A to precipitate the antibody-receptor complex, rather than anti-human immunoglobulin, may be partly responsible for this low sensitivity, other methodological problems are likely to exist. It is suggested that this potentially critical assay becomes a subject for regular audit. 
Role of intraoperative ultrasound examination in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. To determine its potential impact on perioperative surgical management intraoperative ultrasound examination (cross sectional imaging, colour flow mapping, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler) was used in 16 consecutive patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. Epicardial cross sectional imaging before bypass defined the precise intracardiac morphology in 15 of 16 patients. The preoperative morphological diagnosis was refined in four patients (25%), and this influenced surgical management in two (12%). Epicardial studies after bypass identified seven residual haemodynamic lesions in five patients (three residual intercardiac shunts, one ventricular outflow obstruction, one pulmonary artery obstruction, two mitral valve regurgitation), and led to immediate revision during a second period of bypass in three (18%). In one patient who required early reoperation residual shunting was not detected after bypass by either colour flow mapping or a contrast study. Final intraoperative studies showed a good surgical result in 14 patients (87%). Flow characteristics and flow velocities within the Fontan circulation could be assessed immediately after the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass by means of combined pulsed wave Doppler and colour flow mapping in 14 of the 16 patients. Cross sectional studies of the left heart after bypass showed no change in ventricular function and allowed monitoring of volume replacement and ventricular filling. Intraoperative ultrasound was a valuable monitoring technique in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. It refined preoperative diagnosis, monitored ventricular function, and identified or excluded residual haemodynamic lesions in most patients. 
Postoperative vasospasm after antegrade mesenteric revascularization: a report of three cases. Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a "protected" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome. 
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The evolution of the present approach to the newborn with hypoplastic left heart is outlined. Preoperatively, maintenance of ductal patency with prostaglandin E1 and balancing of systemic and pulmonary blood flow are essential. Operative details of the first-stage palliation and the definitive second-stage procedure are described. The more recent adoption of an intermediate-stage hemi-Fontan procedure is also described. Since January 1989, 151 patients have been treated using this three-stage approach, with 109 early survivors. Seventy-eight have undergone the hemi-Fontan operation with nine deaths (5 of whom came to this stage early nonelectively because of shunt failure or ventricular dysfunction). Twenty-seven of the 78 patients undergoing hemi-Fontan operation have subsequently undergone definitive Fontan procedures with no deaths. 
Acute leukemia/lymphoma of plasmacytoid T-cell type. Plasmacytic morphologic characteristics are usually associated with cells of B-lymphocyte origin. Recently, plasmacytoid T-cells have been described in reactive lymph nodes and a rare form of lymphoma characteristically associated with myeloproliferative disorders. This report documents a case of plasmacytoid T-cell malignancy that initially presented as an acute leukemia in an elderly man with a longstanding myelodysplastic syndrome. The tumor replaced bone marrow and involved lymph nodes. Despite aggressive therapy, he died quickly of his leukemia/lymphoma. This case illustrates the need for complete cellular analysis in the diagnosis of morphologically plasmacytic malignancies and raises additional questions about the relationship of this peculiar type of T-cell to the hematopoietic marrow. 
Intracranial metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma. Report of three autopsy cases and review of the literature. We report three cases of brain metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma that were seen at autopsy. We present a summarized review of 15 similar reports that were previously published. Our study included three aged male patients with a long occupational history of heavy asbestos exposure. In two patients, the metastases were discovered incidentally at autopsy, and there were no neurologic symptoms referred to before death. In the other patient, who had clinically occult mesothelioma, the intracranial tumor was discovered ante mortem: in this patient, the clinical features, as well as a computed tomographic scan, suggested a primary tumor of the brain. Interestingly, the histologic features of the latter case that were seen at autopsy depicted a spindle cell tumor that focally exhibited pseudopalisading, necrosis, vascular buds, which deceptively recalled a glioblastoma. All the three cases shared a basic sarcomatous pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma in both primary and metastatic tumors. The immunohistochemical profile was consistent with such interpretation. It was concluded that metastases to the brain from malignant pleural mesothelioma, although rare, are not exceptional even if their clinical relevance is not prominent. They are seen concomitantly with high-grade tumors, and by mimicking a primary tumor on a clinical, instrumental, and histologic ground, they may occasionally represent a potential source of diagnostic pitfall. 
Chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade prevents the development of beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in experimental right-sided congestive heart failure in dogs. BACKGROUND. The reductions of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness to catecholamines in congestive heart failure are associated with excessive sympathetic stimulation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the myocardial changes could be prevented by beta-receptor blockade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We administered the oral beta-receptor blocking agent nadolol (40 mg/day) to dogs during an early stage of experimental right heart failure and to sham-operated dogs for 5 weeks. Animals receiving no nadolol were studied concurrently. Nadolol treatment did not prevent right ventricular hypertrophy or elevated concentrations of plasma norepinephrine that occurred in right heart failure, nor did it affect the decrease in myocardial norepinephrine content and norepinephrine uptake activity, suggesting that the hemodynamic stress imposed on the right ventricle of dogs with right heart failure was similar regardless of the presence or absence of beta-receptor blockade. Resting heart rate, right atrial pressure, aortic pressure, cardiac output, right ventricular dP/dt, and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P measured 5 days after discontinuation of nadolol did not differ significantly from those without nadolol treatment in either right heart failure or sham-operated animals. Sham-operated dogs also showed no changes in myocardial beta-receptor or adenylate cyclase activity after nadolol treatment. However, nadolol treatment prevented the reduction of myocardial beta-receptor density and attenuated the decrease in the cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity that occurred in right heart failure. CONCLUSIONS. Excessive sympathetic stimulation may play an important role in the development of beta-receptor downregulation and beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in right heart failure. 
Oval cell proliferation and the origin of small hepatocytes in liver injury induced by D-galactosamine. Oval cells may function as facultative liver stem cells and tumor progenitors in liver carcinogenesis. The authors determined whether oval cells proliferate and if small hepatocytes might be generated from epithelial cell progenitors in noncarcinogenic liver injury. The authors found that oval cells similar to those detected in early carcinogenesis proliferate in response to D-galactosamine (GaIN). Oval cells expressed gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, bile duct-type cytokeratins and peanut agglutinin binding. Two unusual types of hepatocytes also appeared after injury: small hepatocytes (less than or equal to 16 microns in diameter) and hepatocytes lining atypical ductlike structures. In situ hybridization studies showed that the fetal form of alphafetoprotein mRNA was expressed by many oval cells, some bile duct cells, and occasional hepatocytes. By following the fate of epithelial cells labeled early after GaIN administration, the authors conclude that duct cells can generate both oval cells and small hepatocytes in response to GaIN. 
Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2-year prospective study. To measure protection induced by natural rotavirus infection, 163 infants enrolled in a rotavirus vaccine trial were prospectively followed for 2 years. Serotype 1 rotaviruses were the predominant circulating strains during the study. Over the 2 years of observation, significantly fewer infants infected before enrollment developed a symptomatic reinfection (0 of 21) or any reinfection (4 of 21) compared with previously uninfected infants (P = .0003). Of the 60 infants who developed a primary rotavirus infection in the first year (40 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) only 4 were reinfected in the second year compared with 29 of 82 subjects not previously infected (P = .00003). Asymptomatic primary infection appeared to be as protective as symptomatic primary infection. The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years. 
A 50-year follow-up of childhood plumbism. Hypertension, renal function, and hemoglobin levels among survivors. A group of 192 subjects with well-documented lead poisoning in 1930 to 1942 were identified in this pilot study. Thirty-five of 72 survivors traced to a Boston area address and 22 age-, sex-, race-, and neighborhood-matched controls were recruited into a clinical study. One matched subject with plumbism had grossly abnormal renal function and an elevated blood lead level of an unclear cause. Among the remaining 21 matched pairs, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher in subjects with plumbism (relative risk, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 42.3). Mean adjusted creatinine clearance rates for subjects with plumbism, however, were significantly higher than those of controls and supranormal in comparison to rates predicted for sex and age. Subjects with plumbism had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit readings than the controls. Blood lead and serum creatinine levels were low for both groups. These results suggest that survivors of childhood lead poisoning have an increased risk of clinically significant hypertension developing in the setting of supranormal creatinine clearance rates. 
Dilatation of ascending aorta in patients with repaired coarctation. The long-term outcome following repair of typical aortic coarctation in adulthood may be complicated by disorders of the ascending aorta. Follow-up averaging 15 years revealed a 3.8% incidence of dilatation of the ascending aorta after such late repair. Hypertension and concomitant aortic valvular disease were common in these patients. Aortic dilatation can appear years after coarctation repair, irrespective of the operative technique and its success, and can lead to death from aortic dissection or rupture of an aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up after coarctation repair in adulthood is advisable to detect late aortic complications. 
Ifosfamide plus etoposide combined with regional hyperthermia in patients with locally advanced sarcomas: a phase II study. From July 1986 to July 1989, 40 patients (92% pretreated) with deep-seated, advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS, 25 patients), Ewing's sarcomas (ES, eight patients), osteosarcomas (OS, three patients) and chondrosarcomas (ChS, four patients) were treated at the University of Munich in a protocol involving regional hyperthermia (RHT) combined with ifosfamide plus etoposide. A total of 265 RHT treatments (mean, 6.6 RHT per patient) were applied including 33 pelvic, four extremity, and three abdominal sites. The mean tumor volume was 537 cc (range, 50 to 2,980 cc). For systemic chemotherapy, all patients received ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2, days 1 to 5), etoposide (100 mg/m2, days 1, 3, and 5), and mesna (300 mg/m2 x 4, days 1 to 5) with RHT given only on days 1 and 5 in repeated cycles every 4 weeks. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain (57%) combined with local discomfort within the annular phased array applicator (AA) of the BSD hyperthermia system (BSD Medical Corp, Salt Lake City, UT). The average maximum systemic temperature was 37.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and there was no indication of enhanced bone marrow toxicity due to the addition of RHT to the systemic chemotherapy. Detailed thermal mapping by invasive thermometry was performed in all patients. In 38 assessable patients, the overall objective response rate was 37%: six complete responses (CRs), four partial responses (PRs), and four favorable histologic responses (FHRs) (95% confidence limits, 22% to 54%). Complete responders are alive and disease-free at 40, 35, 23, 19, 19, and 8 months. Of patients with PR and FHR, two died from metastatic disease after 4 and 17 months and one died from other disease after 27 months. The remaining five patients are stable at 37, 25, 21, 13, and 8 months. Eleven patients showed no change (NC), and 13 patients showed local tumor progression (PD). The mean observation time for all patients was 11.6 months. The time-averaged temperatures (Ts) of all RHT treatments calculated as 20% (T20), 50% (T50), or 90% (T90) of measured tumor sites differed significantly between responders and nonresponders (T20, P = .003; T50, P = .006; and T90, P = .004; respectively). These data support activity for ifosfamide-etoposide combined with RHT in pretreated patients with advanced sarcomas. 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the causative agent for pneumonia in the immunocompromised host. A young man undergoing chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma presented with fever, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a new infiltrate on the chest roentgenogram. Routine cultures and cytopathologic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid provided no evidence for an etiology; however, special cultures of the BAL fluid demonstrated heavy growth of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We recommend that evaluation of pneumonia in the immuno-compromised host include appropriate cultures of BAL fluid for M pneumoniae, particularly when the patient is 5 to 25 years old, the age of high incidence of mycoplasmal pneumonia. 
Frontal sinus carcinoma presenting as acute sinusitis. Primary carcinoma of the frontal sinus is extremely rare. The aetiology of the tumour remains obscure, and even with rapid diagnosis and radical surgery the prognosis remains very poor. 
Clinical significance of a dizziness history in medical patients with syncope. To determine the implications of dizziness as a symptom in patients with syncope, we analyzed responses to a standardized battery of questions about dizziness in 121 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of syncope. Associations were sought between final diagnosis (dependent variable) and clinical predictor variables. Dizziness was found in 70% of the patients with syncope. Dizzy patients were younger (mean ages, 47 vs 56 years, respectively), more often female (75% vs 42%), and more likely to be assigned a psychiatric diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified young age and rotatory dizziness (vertigo) to be associated with a psychiatric diagnosis. Dizziness and syncope frequently coexist and in many cases may represent the same pathophysiologic process. A careful dizziness history may guide the initial evaluation of syncope patients in clinical practice. 
Attenuation of IL-2-induced multisystem organ edema by phalloidin and antamanide. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor. Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema. Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins. This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo. Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline. Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney. With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls. The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls. Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak. Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D. Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak. 
Current treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results and surgical implications. From July 1986 to January 1991, 123 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent operation for ablation of aberrant conduction pathways. There were 85 male and 38 female patients ranging in age from 11 months to 68 years. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident. 
Intermittent ischemia potentiates intestinal reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury. 
Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and other antihypertensive agents: results of clinical trials. Clinical trials in which the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker terazosin was given in combination with other antihypertensive agents are reviewed. Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride, triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo. In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers, diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects. 
Repressor to activator switch by mutations in the first Zn finger of the glucocorticoid receptor: is direct DNA binding necessary? Transfection of HeLa cells with cDNA vectors expressing the wild-type human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) enabled dexamethasone to strongly repress cytokine- and second messenger-induced expression of cotransfected chimeric reporter genes containing transcription regulatory DNA elements from the human interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter. Deletion of the DNA-binding domain or of the second Zn finger or a point mutation in the Zn catenation site in the second finger blocked the ability of GR to mediate repression of the IL-6 promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of the first Zn finger, a point mutation in the Zn-catenation site in the first finger, or one in the steroid-specificity domain at the base of the first finger converted GR into a dexamethasone-responsive activator that enhanced basal and interleukin 1-induced IL-6 promoter function. These first-finger mutants of GR also mediated dexamethasone-responsive enhancement of expression of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TK-105-CAT and TK-80-CAT) reporter genes but not of the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-CAT or the c-fos-CAT (pFC700) reporter genes. Wild-type GR was able to specifically bind to DNA fragments containing glucocorticoid response element sequences in both the murine mammary tumor virus and IL-6 promoters, albeit weakly to the latter, in a sequential DNA-binding immunoprecipitation assay. The first-finger mutants of GR, however, were inactive in this assay. Thus, mutations in the first Zn finger unmask unusual promoter-specific activation properties of GR that may not require direct high-affinity binding of the mutant GR to target DNA. 
Radiation exposure of pediatric patients and physicians during cardiac catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were applied to various areas of 61 pediatric patients and physicians to measure radiation doses during routine cardiac catheterization and during 4 cases of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Radiation doses were measured during chest roentgenography, fluoroscopy and cineangiography. Average skin dose to the chest was 121 microGy during chest x-ray, 5,182 microGy during catheterization and 641 mGy during valvuloplasty. For the eyes, thyroid and gonads of the patients, the exposure during routine catheterization was equal to 0.4, 6 and 0.2 chest x-rays, respectively. Radiation dose of the operator was 3 microGy for the eyes and 6 miCroGy in the thyroid. About 56% of the operator's dose could be reduced by thyroid shields, and 80% by lead aprons. The assistant received only 1 microGy outside the thyroid shield. Therefore, we have concluded that the patients' dose during routine catheterization is largely based on our experimental results, but the dose is acceptable based on the risk factor analysis. The skin dose to the right lateral chest of the patient during valvuloplasty is extremely high, perhaps as high as the equivalent of 1,000 chest x-rays. Besides the clinical benefits of valvuloplasty, the long-term radiation-related hazards to the patient should be carefully monitored. 
Variables controlling the secretion of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 in normal human subjects. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is one of a family of IGFBPs that are present in extracellular fluids, and binds both IGF-II and IGF-I with high affinity. These studies were conducted to determine the nutritional and hormonal variables that regulate plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations in humans. The mean plasma IGFBP-2 concentration for 38 normal adult subjects was 150 +/- 61 micrograms/L and was 4.7-fold greater than their mean fasting IGFBP-1 value. Mean IGFBP-2 values in cord sera of 26 normal term infants was 3.8-fold greater than the normal adult mean value. Likewise, the mean value for 44 hypopituitary adults was increased 2-fold compared to normal. There was no suppression of IGFBP-2 values in acromegaly. Normal adult subjects showed minimal fluctuations (less than 2-fold changes) in plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations during a 48-h sampling period. These changes were significantly less than the changes that occurred in plasma IGFBP-1 during the same interval. Plasma IGFBP-2 did not change significantly post prandially or after a glucose infusion. Extreme insulin deficiency, after 9 days of fasting, was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in plasma IGFBP-2. Administration of GH, which is known to cause a major decrease in plasma IGFBP-1 and in IGFBP-2 in hypophysectomized animals, did not result in a change in calorically restricted normal adult subjects, suggesting that a normal caloric intake is required for GH to suppress IGFBP-2. In summary, these results show that plasma IGFBP-2 is regulated differently than IGFBP-1. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion does not suppress IGFBP-2, and there is much less daily fluctuation compared to IGFBP-1. These findings suggest that plasma IGFBP-2 levels are more stable than IGFBP-1, and therefore IGFBP-2 may serve as a larger reservior that is available for IGF transport. 
Infarction in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. A case report. An unusual case of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with infarction is presented. The patient, a 16-year-old girl with a three-year history of oral contraceptive use, presented with a two-week history of intermittent abdominal pain. Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and the role of estrogens in the development of this lesion are discussed. 
Solitary pulmonary nodule: high-resolution CT and radiologic-pathologic correlation. Edge and internal characteristics of pulmonary nodules evaluated with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were correlated with the pathologic specimens in 93 patients. Speculation correlated pathologically with irregular fibrosis, localized lymphatic spread of tumor, or an infiltrative tumor growth pattern and was observed in six of 11 benign nodules (55%) and 74 of 85 malignant nodules (87%). Pleural tags were observed in three benign nodules (27%) and 49 malignant lesions (58%); pathologically, these represented fibrotic bands usually associated with juxta-cicatricial pleural retraction. Bubblelike areas of low attenuation within the nodule were observed in 21 malignant lesions (25%) and only one benign nodule (9%). They were observed most commonly in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (seven of 14) and were due either to patent small bronchi or small, cystic spaces within neoplastic glands. Malignant nodules as a group were larger than benign lesions (P = .02) and more commonly demonstrated a spiculated contour (P less than .05), lobulation (P less than .001), and inhomogeneous attenuation (P less than .05). 
The association of bullous pemphigoid and malignant disease: a case control study. In a case control study, the incidence of malignant disease in 84 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) was compared with 168 controls. The rate of malignant disease (past, concurrent or during follow-up) in BP patients was 17.9% compared to 5.3% in the controls. A number of the malignancies occurring in the BP group may be of doubtful significance, being either temporally very remote or partially attributable to treatment. The rate of concurrent BP and malignancy (within 8 weeks) was 6.0% suggesting that there is probably a slight excess of malignancy in BP, but insufficient to warrant extensive investigation in pursuit of cancer. Comparison of the BP patients with and without cancer identified no clinical or immunopathological subgroups in whom investigations would be indicated. Three patients with both BP and malignancy were HLA-DR 13 positive, which may point to an immunogenetic predisposition to both diseases. 
Oxygen transport during steady-state submaximal exercise in chronic hypoxia. Arterial O2 delivery during short-term submaximal exercise falls on arrival at high altitude but thereafter remains constant. As arterial O2 content increases with acclimatization, blood flow falls. We evaluated several factors that could influence O2 delivery during more prolonged submaximal exercise after acclimatization at 4,300 m. Seven men (23 +/- 2 yr) performed 45 min of steady-state submaximal exercise at sea level (barometric pressure 751 Torr), on acute ascent to 4,300 m (barometric pressure 463 Torr), and after 21 days of residence at altitude. The O2 uptake (VO2) was constant during exercise, 51 +/- 1% of maximal VO2 at sea level, and 65 +/- 2% VO2 at 4,300 m. After acclimatization, exercise cardiac output decreased 25 +/- 3% compared with arrival and leg blood flow decreased 18 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), with no change in the percentage of cardiac output to the leg. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial O2 saturation increased, but total body and leg O2 delivery remained unchanged. After acclimatization, a reduction in plasma volume was offset by an increase in erythrocyte volume, and total blood volume did not change. Mean systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and leg vascular resistance were all greater after acclimatization (P less than 0.05). Mean plasma norepinephrine levels also increased during exercise in a parallel fashion with increased vascular resistance. Thus we conclude that both total body and leg O2 delivery decrease after arrival at 4,300 m and remain unchanged with acclimatization as a result of a parallel fall in both cardiac output and leg blood flow and an increase in arterial O2 content. 
Positron emission tomography for the assessment of myocardial viability. The detection of viable myocardium or ischemically injured myocardium with a reversible impairment of contractile function remains clinically important but challenging. Detection of reversible dysfunction and distinction from irreversible tissue injury by positron emission tomography is based on identification of preserved or even enhanced glucose metabolism with F-18 2-fluoro 2-deoxyglucose. Regional patterns of myocardial glucose utilization and blood flow, defined as perfusion-metabolism mismatches or matches, on positron emission tomography in patients with chronic or even acute ischemic heart disease are highly accurate in predicting the functional outcome after interventional revascularization. Compared with thallium-201 redistribution scintigraphy, positron emission tomography appears to be diagnostically more accurate, especially in patients with severely impaired left ventricular function. While larger clinical trials are needed for further confirmation, positron emission tomography has already proved clinically useful for stratifying patients with poor left ventricular function to the most appropriate therapeutic approach. 
Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with sucralfate: a review. Sucralfate has been used widely for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Healing rates for duodenal ulcer range from 60 to 90% at 4-6 weeks and up to 90% at 12 weeks for gastric ulcer. The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists. There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations. 
Enzymic control of the expression of the X determinant (CD15) in human myeloid cells during maturation: the regulatory role of 6-sialytransferase. To establish the basis for the reduced expression of the X determinant on leukemic blasts and the changes in antigenic expression that occur during myeloid maturation, the presence on myeloid cells of X and related structures was examined in conjunction with studies on the activities of the glycosyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis. Expression of X and sialyl-X was weak on blasts in comparison with neutrophils despite the presence of the requisite precursor structures. Much higher levels of 3-fucosyltransferase activity were found in blasts than in neutrophils when nonsialylated substrates were used, but, whereas the enzyme in neutrophils reacted equally well with 3'-sialylated and nonsialylated acceptors, the enzyme in blasts showed a marked preference for nonsialylated substrates. 6'-Sialyltransferase activity was strong in blasts but was not detectable in neutrophils, whereas a much lower level of 3'-sialyltransferase activity was present in both blasts and neutrophils. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced maturation of HL60 cells was associated with (1) a decrease in both 6'-sialyltransferase and 3-fucosyltransferase activities, (2) a change in the substrate specificity of 3-fucosyltransferase towards that found in mature cells, and (3) increased cell surface expression of sialyl-X. These results suggest that the reduced expression of X in myeloblasts is related to the presence of the strong 6'-sialyltransferase, which uses the precursor substrate at the expense of the 3-fucosyltransferase and prevents the synthesis of X and sialyl-X. The developmental regulation of the levels of 3'- and 6'-sialyltransferases, and the level and specificity of the 3-fucosyltransferases, therefore controls the expression of X and its degree of sialylation. 
Vitamin B6 and valproic acid in treatment of infantile spasms. Twenty patients with infantile spasms were treated with high doses of vitamin b6, valproic acid, or both. Three of 13 patients (23%) treated initially with high doses of vitamin B6 demonstrated a definite reduction in seizures; 2 patients had no improvement on electroencephalography. Vitamin B6 therapy alone was continued in a single patient (8%) who remained seizure-free during the 15-month follow-up period. Initial treatment with vitamin B6 and valproic acid improved the electroencephalogram significantly more (P less than 0.05) than initial vitamin B6 treatment alone. The group which had valproic acid added to vitamin B6 therapy had significantly fewer seizures (P less than 0.05) and better electroencephalograms (P less than 0.01) than did the group treated initially with vitamin B6 alone. There were no significant differences among the group treated initially with vitamin B6, the group treated initially with valproic acid, and the group in which valproic acid was substituted for vitamin B6. ACTH was more effective in abolishing seizures than was valproic acid or vitamin B6 and valproic acid. ACTH had an excellent effect on seizures in 86% of patients who did not respond well to vitamin B6, valproic acid, or both; however, many of these patients had later recurrence of infantile spasms. The combination of vitamin B6 and valproic acid is effective and safe in the treatment of infantile spasms. 
Natural history and prognostic variables in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The clinical features at the time of presentation and the outcome in 126 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied to clarify the natural history and prognosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The median age of the patients at the time of presentation was 36 years, 62% were male, and 16% were asymptomatic. The median follow-up from time of presentation was 5.8 years. There were more patients who had liver transplants (21%) than patients who died of liver-related disease (16%); the estimated median survival to these end points was 12 years. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 8 patients and in 23% of those undergoing liver transplantation. Asymptomatic patients had milder disease than symptomatic patients, but in a univariate analysis the presence of symptoms was not prognostically significant. On multivariate analysis, the following independent prognostic factors were found: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, histological stage, and age. These features were combined to produce a prognostic model that should be valuable in the stratification of patients in clinical trials and in the timing of liver transplantation, particularly in those patients seen soon after presentation. 
Intensive therapy for small-cell lung cancer using carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mid-cycle vincristine, and radiotherapy. Forty patients with small-cell lung cancer (31 patients with limited-stage [LS] disease, and nine patients with extensive-stage [ES] disease but of good performance status) have been treated with an intensive therapy composed of carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with vincristine on day 14 of each carboplatin cycle. A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle. The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L. Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery. Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia. Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR). Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months. Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients. The median survival of the total group was 14 months with an actual 2-year survival of 30% and a minimum follow-up of 28 months. 
Cervical bruits: clinical correlates of stenosis. To analyze the relationship among characteristics of buits, degree of underlying stenosis, and neurologic symptom complexes, the authors studied 157 patients with bruits undergoing digital subtraction angiography. Symptom status assignment (definite lateralizing, possible lateralizing, vertebrobasilar, diffuse, and asymptomatic) and cervical auscultation for location, duration, and other bruit characteristics were performed independently. Bruit occurrence was associated with stenosis of greater than or equal to 50% of the underlying vessel with the association being no stronger at higher levels of stenosis (greater than or equal to 80%). No relationship existed between the side of bruit and side of symptoms in those with lateralized symptoms. The authors found more severe degrees of carotid stenosis in two symptomatic groups (vertebrobasilar insufficiency [VBI] and definite lateralized) compared with asymptomatic patients. Those with VBI had more high-grade stenosis, whereas those with lateralized symptoms had more occlusions, which tended to be ipsilateral to the symptoms. 
Complement activation during bypass in acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Serial complement estimations during cardiopulmonary bypass are reported in a patient with acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Although the extent of classic and alternative pathway activation appeared appropriate, exaggerated common pathway activation with massive increase in the C3d:C3 ratio occurred. A fatal hemostatic disorder, pulmonary edema, and circulatory collapse ensued despite prophylaxis and therapy.
