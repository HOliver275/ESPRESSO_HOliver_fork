Modulating effects of calcium in animal models of colon carcinogenesis and short-term studies in subjects at increased risk for colon cancer. A substantive amount of evidence from animal models supports the hypothesis that dietary fat is an etiological factor in colon cancer. Although various theories account for possible mechanisms, it is clear that under the influence of a basic colonic pH, fatty acids and bile acids may become highly surfactant in the colon, causing cell loss and compensatory hyperproliferation. Calcium likely reduces lipid damage in the colon by complexing with fat to form mineral-fat complexes or soaps. It has been shown in an increasing number of animal experiments that calcium has the ability to inhibit colon cancer. In limited studies in man, the colonic hyperproliferation associated with increased risk for colon cancer has been reversed for short periods by administration of supplemental dietary calcium. Taken together the available evidence suggests that increases in the daily intake of calcium in the diet may provide a means of colorectal-cancer control. 
Cavernous malformations of the brain stem. Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent. 
A t(4;22) in a meningioma points to the localization of a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Cytogenetic analysis of meningioma cells from one particular patient (MN32) displayed the stem-line karyo-type 45, XY, -1, 4p+, 22q-, 22q+, which thus had rearrangements of both chromosomes 22. The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter. The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere. The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11. We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22. To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes. Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11). On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene. The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome. The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped. 
The rapid and reversible activation of a calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 during myocardial ischemia. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of two members of a novel family of calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipases A2 in mammalian myocardium (Wolf, R. A., and R. W. Gross. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:7295-7303; and Hazen, S. L., D. A. Ford, and R. W. Gross. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266:5629-5633). To examine the potential role of these calcium-independent phospholipases A2 in mediating membrane dysfunction during early myocardial ischemia, the temporal course of alterations in phospholipase A2 activity during global ischemia in Langendorf perfused rabbit hearts was quantified and compared with traditionally accepted markers of myocytic ischemic injury and anaerobic metabolism. We now report that membrane-associated calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity increased over 400% during 2 min of global ischemia (P less than 0.01), was near maximally activated (greater than 10-fold) after only 5 min of ischemia, and remained activated throughout the entire ischemic interval examined (2-60 min). Activation of membrane-associated plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 after 5 min of myocardial ischemia was rapidly reversible during reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Both the activation of phospholipase A2 and its reversibility during reperfusion were temporally correlated to alterations in myocytic anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, activation of membrane-associated phospholipase A2 was essentially complete before electron microscopic evidence of cellular damage. Collectively, these results identify dynamic alterations in calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity during myocardial ischemia which precede irreversible cellular injury and demonstrate that activation of plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 is amongst the earliest biochemical alterations in ischemic myocardium. 
Reproducibility of quantitative planar thallium-201 scintigraphy: quantitative criteria for reversibility of myocardial perfusion defects. Fifty-two paired stress/delayed planar 201TI studies (27 exercise studies, 25 dipyridamole studies) were processed twice by seven technologists to assess inter- and intraobserver variability. The reproducibility was inversely related to the size of 201TI perfusion abnormalities. Intraobserver variability was not different between exercise and dipyridamole studies for lesions of similar size. Based upon intraobserver variability, objective quantitative criteria for reversibility of perfusion abnormalities were defined. These objective criteria were tested prospectively in a separate group of 35 201TI studies and compared with the subjective interpretation of quantitative circumferential profiles. Overall, exact agreement existed in 78% of images (kappa statistic k = 0.66). We conclude that quantification of planar 201TI scans is highly reproducible, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability. Objective criteria for lesion reversibility correlated well with analysis by experienced observers. 
Delays in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction: an overview. Delays in treatment of acute myocardial infarction prevent a substantial portion of patients from receiving maximal benefit from reperfusion therapy. Median delay between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital is 2 to 4 hours. Average time between arrival at the hospital and initiation of thrombolytic therapy is 84 minutes. Approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for suspected acute myocardial infarction do not use the emergency medical service system. Delay before treatment can be divided into several components: patient delay, emergency medical service delay, and hospital delay. Factors contributing to delay in each component and possible approaches to decreasing these delays are discussed. The effects of treatment delay on prognosis and future care-seeking behavior of patients hospitalized with suspected acute myocardial infarction are also discussed. 
Na,K-ATPase in isolated nephron segments in rats with experimental heart failure. To characterize renal transport of Na+ in heart failure, urinary Na+ excretion (UNaV), aldosterone levels, and Na,K-ATPase activity in isolated nephron segments were determined in three groups: control rats, rats with heart failure and moderate sodium retention, and rats with heart failure and severe sodium retention. Heart failure was induced by a fistula between the aorta and vena cava. For the control group, UNaV was 0.66 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SEM) mueq/min, and aldosterone was 18.4 +/- 3.5 ng%. Na,K-ATPase activity (in 10(-11) mol/mm/min) was 28.4 +/- 1.1 in the proximal convoluted tubule, 23.3 +/- 1.0 in the proximal straight tubule, 37.4 +/- 1.9 in the medullary thick ascending limb, 40.2 +/- 1.9 in the cortical thick ascending limb, 43.2 +/- 2.2 in the distal convoluted tubule, and 20.5 +/- 0.9 in the cortical collecting duct. For the group with moderate heart failure, UNaV was 0.35 +/- 0.02 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 15.9 +/- 4.4 (p = NS versus control). Na,K-ATPase activity was unchanged in the proximal convoluted tubule, proximal straight tubule, medullary thick ascending limb, and cortical collecting duct, but it increased in the cortical thick ascending limb to 57.7 +/- 3.1 (p less than 0.001 versus control) and decreased in the distal convoluted tubule to 35.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.005 versus control). For the group with severe heart failure, UNaV was 0.029 +/- 0.016 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 186.0 +/- 14.8 (p less than 0.001 versus control). 
The prognosis of Hodgkin's disease in older adults. This investigation was undertaken to assess the apparent poor survival of older patients with Hodgkin's disease. The clinical course of Hodgkin's disease in 136 patients, 60 to 79 years of age, was compared with that of 223 patients, 40 to 59 years of age. The patients registered from November 1977 through December 1983 had not been previously treated, and were treated at eight cancer centers. When the prognosis of all patients was examined by age, a definite change in the pattern of survival first appeared in the 60- to 69-year-old cohort. The entire older group (60 to 79 years) experienced twice the risk of dying from Hodgkin's disease and four times the risk of dying from other causes than did the younger group. In both groups, stage of disease was the strongest factor in predicting adjusted survival. Delay in treatment and advanced stage at presentation were not characteristic of Hodgkin's disease in older patients as has been postulated. Older patients responded to therapy with a similar complete remission rate (84% v 88% in the younger group, P = .24). From this study, we conclude that (1) Hodgkin's disease in the older adult does not have a different natural history, its major risk factors are similar to those known in other age groups, and thus should be amenable to existing therapeutic approaches; and (2) the prognosis of older patients with Hodgkin's disease has been obscured in previous studies by the inclusion of deaths due to other causes in survival estimates. 
Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma. Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls. Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia. Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function. 
Periorbital hematoma secondary to sinusitis in a child. Periorbital abscess secondary to sinusitis is a well-recognized entity in children. However, subperiosteal hematoma is extremely rare and has been reported in only four adult patients. This article presents the case of a 4-year-old girl with sinusitis, proptosis, and decreased visual acuity. Surgical exploration of the orbit revealed the presence of a large organizing subperiosteal hematoma that was drained. The presence of a periorbital hematoma should be suspected in patients with acute onset of proptosis and findings of a periorbital mass and sinusitis on computed tomographic scan. 
Hypoxia-mediated in vivo release of dopamine in nucleus tractus solitarii of rabbits. A wide variety of neuroactive substances have been suggested to be involved in the respiratory depression observed in response to severe hypoxia. By use of the technique of microdialysis, the release of dopamine (DA) was measured in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxic provocations (6% O2 in N2) in the adult pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbit. DA release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Such hypoxic provocations caused pronounced phase of depression in the phrenic nerve activity and enhanced release of DA. After bilateral carotid sinus nerve denervation, acute severe hypoxia did not give rise to enhanced release of DA or to phrenic nerve depression. Mild hypoxic (9% or 12% O2 in N2) or hypercapnic (6% CO2) stimuli resulted in an increased phrenic nerve activity without any concomitant changes in DA release. Decerebration at the midcollicular level in rabbits prevented an enhanced release of DA in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxia. The results suggest that 1) DA is involved in the central ventilatory response to severe hypoxia, 2) not only the initial excitatory but also the second depressive phase in response to severe hypoxia is mediated partially by the peripheral chemoreceptors, and 3) the depressive phase is dependent on intact connections from suprapontine structures. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Glucagon-induced alteration of serum bile acid level in patients with liver cirrhosis. Percent changes in serum total bile acid level after IV administration of 1 mg glucagon were measured in 61 cirrhotics. Thirty-three of 38 cases with Child's grade A disease showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes; this level was maintained in the majority of them until 120 minutes. A similar mode of serial changes in total bile acid level was also shown in the cases with Child's grade B disease. On the other hand, only 2 of 10 cases with Child's grade C showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes. Reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration was mimicked by infusion of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. However, in 3 of 6 cases with elevated total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate induced a reduction of total bile acid level. Also, it was confirmed that glucagon enhances the uptake of taurocholate into freshly isolated rat hepatocytes by activating Na(+)-dependent, carrier-mediated membrane transport system and observed that its effect is associated with elevation of Vmax (0.6114 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 without glucagon; 0.975 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 in glucagon added) but not with affecting Km (13.58 mumol/L without glucagon; 13.71 mumol/L with glucagon) or protein synthesis which is inhibited by cycloheximide. These observations suggest that glucagon enhances Na(+)-coupled membrane transport of bile acids in the liver and causes the reduction of serum total bile acid level and that a lack of this response may be indicative of membrane dysfunction in the liver. 
Chimeric BCR-abl messenger RNA as a marker for minimal residual disease in patients transplanted for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We correlated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable BCR-abl fusion transcripts with cytogenetic status in 24 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Of 10 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients, only one was found to exhibit a BCR-abl fusion transcript. Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL. 
Bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in reoperative and primary coronary bypass surgery Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting is recognized as a preferred method of myocardial revascularization. However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%. No significant difference was found in the equality of survival distribution for the two groups. 
Occurrence of neoplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in a DMARD Registry. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry Steering Committee. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry (RAAR) was established in 1982 to examine the safety of azathioprine (AZA) and other disease modifying agents (DMARD) in the treatment of RA. In yearly followup over the past 7 years, 20 malignant conditions have been reported in 530 DMARD treated adult patients with RA. Incidence density ratios (IDR) and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated to assess cancer risk. For all cancers the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.90-2.60). For men the SMR was 1.71 (95% CI 0.84-3.52); for women the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89-2.60). Adjusted for age, the IDR was highest in the 70-79-year-old study population (3.41). The age and sex adjusted SMR for lymphoproliferative disorders and myeloma was 8.05 (95% CI 3.30-20.81). The SMR for lung cancer (n = 6) was also increased (3.37; 95% CI 1.58-7.34). Compared with the general population, patients with RA requiring DMARD therapy may be at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders. The RAAR is an important prospective technique which will ultimately permit assessment of neoplasia risk by type and duration of DMARD therapy. 
Adenosine in myocardial perfusion imaging using positron emission tomography. Because of its unique ability to demonstrate the metabolic consequences of myocardial ischemia, positron emission tomography (PET) is extremely valuable in assessing myocardial viability. PET imaging can identify the myocardial segments that are likely to improve after revascularization and may be more sensitive and specific for the detection of coronary artery disease compared with thallium perfusion imaging. Adenosine has several advantages over dipyridamole as a pharmacologic stress agent for use with PET. It produces maximal vasodilation in a significantly greater percentage of patients, is a more potent coronary vasodilator, and its very short half-life may be ideal for use with the very short half-life radioactive tracers used in PET. When combined with metabolic studies, adenosine may be useful for the assessment of patients who received thrombolytic therapy for an acute myocardial infarction. 
Colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene in a diabetic patient. We present a case of colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene. Precipitating factors were diabetes and vesical distension caused by the obstruction of an indwelling catheter. This complication is an exceptional outcome in gangrenous cystitis and it requires emergency surgical treatment. 
Beneficial effect of the atrial natriuretic factor analog A68828 in postischemic acute renal failure. Short-term administration of atrial peptides has been reported to improve renal function in several animal models of acute renal failure. We designed experiments that determined the effect of a 13-amino acid analog of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), A68828, on renal function in the postischemic model of acute renal failure. Experiments were conducted using euvolemic, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) under Inactin anesthesia. Acute renal failure was induced by complete occlusion of both renal arteries for 30 min. After release of the clamp, vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline), A68828 (3, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg/min), dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min), A68828 (10 micrograms/kg/min) plus dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) or ANF (1-28) (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) were infused i.v. for a 2-h period. A68828 at 10 micrograms/kg/min produced a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with vehicle controls (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; P less than .05) despite a lower arterial pressure (87 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 5 mm Hg; P less than .05). A subpressor dose of dopamine had no effect on GFR during the postischemic period (0.25 +/- 0.11 ml/min/100 g). Dopamine in combination with A68828 prevented the decrease in arterial pressure seen with A68828 alone but did not potentiate the beneficial effects on GFR (0.28 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g). ANF (1-28) at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min increased GFR to levels nearly identical to those induced by A68828 (0.40 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g). These results indicate that infusion of a reduced-size analog of ANF improves renal function in the immediate postischemic period. Furthermore, prevention of the hypotensive effects of the analog with dopamine provides no additional beneficial effect. 
Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia of the prostate. Immunohistochemical and DNA flow cytometric study. Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia (CCCH) of the prostate is an unusual form of benign prostatic hyperplasia characterized by a nodular proliferation of clear cells with small, uniform nuclei. The authors studied 15 cases of CCCH by immunohistochemistry and 13 of them by DNA flow cytometry to establish the immunohistochemical and DNA profile of this lesion. Patients ranged in age from 58 to 88 years (mean, 68 years). Follow-up of a mean of 22 months showed all patients alive with no evidence of malignant prostatic disease. All 13 CCCHs showed diploid DNA content; in contrast, among 4 papillary/cribriform carcinomas of the prostate used for comparison, 3 were aneuploid and 1 was diploid. A basal cell layer was demonstrated in all 15 CCCHs by the use of the 34 beta E12 anti-high-molecular-weight keratin antibody (EAB-903) that reacts with the basal cells but not with the acinar cells of the prostate. A continuous basal cell layer was not evident in the carcinomas. The blandness of the epithelium, the well-defined nodular configuration, the presence of a basal cell layer demonstrable by immunocytochemistry, and the lack of aneuploidy as determined by DNA flow cytometry together lend support to the concept that CCCH is a benign lesion. 
Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder. We report nine patients with muscle aching, cramps, stiffness, exercise intolerance, and peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Neurologic examination showed calf fasciculations in seven, quadriceps myokymia in two, and deltoid myokymia in one patient. Two patients had mild increase in serum creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed either no abnormality (three patients) or mild neurogenic changes (four patients). Fasciculations were the only abnormality on routine electrodiagnostic studies. Supramaximal stimulation of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Hz produced showers of electrical potentials following the M response in at least one nerve. In three patients, the fasciculations and evoked electrical potentials were abolished by regional application of curare but not nerve block. Carbamazepine therapy caused moderate-to-marked reduction of symptoms and nerve hyperexcitability. We designate this hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder as the "cramp-fasciculation syndrome.". 
Acid peptic disease in adolescents. How to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Acid peptic disease in adolescents may be more common than previously recognized. However, appropriate medical attention is often delayed because of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Thorough questioning of adolescent patients is important to elicit a complete description of symptoms. Endoscopy or intraluminal pH monitoring may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer. Therapy with histamine receptor antagonists, especially ranitidine (Zantac), is recommended. Antireflux surgery may be needed to prevent potential long-term gastrointestinal damage. Patients with duodenal ulcer should also be advised to make life-style changes to avoid recurrence of disease later in life. 
Regimen compliance two years after myocardial infarction. Two-years postinfarction, the effect of a nursing intervention at 30 days postinfarction, and intentions, attitudes, and perceived beliefs of others on regimen compliance of myocardial infarction patients was investigated. The sample was comprised of 51 patients (E = 29, C = 22) who participated in a five-phase study over 2 years. No differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance to activity, stress, and medication prescriptions. The experimental group was significantly more compliant to the diet prescription than the control group. The control group was significantly more compliant than the experimental group with cessation from smoking. Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions at 2 years. Attitude was also predictive of compliance with the diet, smoking, and stress regimens. 
Allergic reactions to long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever. International Rheumatic Fever Study Group. 1790 patients from 11 countries were enrolled in a prospective international study to determine the incidence of allergic reactions to monthly intramuscular benzathine penicillin (penicillin G benzathine) injections to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever. After 32,430 injections during 2736 patient years of observation, 57 of the 1790 patients (3.2%) had an allergic reaction. 4 had anaphylaxis, an incidence of 0.2% (1.2/10,000 injections), all in patients over 12 years of age, and 1 patient died, a fatality incidence of 0.05% (0.31/10,000 injections). These rates are similar to those described for patients without rheumatic fever who receive short-term treatment with parenteral penicillin. Rheumatic fever recurred in 8 of 1790 patients (0.45%) who received benzathine penicillin prophylaxis compared with 11 of 96 (11.5%) who did not comply with treatment. Life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in patients on long-term parenteral benzathine penicillin to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever; the long-term benefits of such prophylaxis by far outweigh the risk of a serious allergic reaction. 
Blood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. 
Protein kinase C is involved in PTH-induced homologous desensitization by directly affecting PTH receptor in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. We have investigated mechanisms of PTH-induced homologous desensitization reflected in the refractoriness of cAMP response to the second exposure to PTH in the clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106. Preincubation with 10(-7) M rat (r) PTH-(1-34) for 6 h caused the desensitization, resulting in a 65% decrease in cAMP accumulation in response to further exposure to rPTH. This desensitization was apparent at 10(-10) M rPTH and maximal at 10(-7) M rPTH. UMR-106 cells treated with protein kinase C (PK-C) activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-6) M) for 6 h also induced desensitization manifested by a loss of rPTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation to 50% of that in the control cells. On the other hand, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, incapable of activating PK-C, failed to induce desensitization. Fifty micromolar H-7 (PK-C inhibitor) significantly blocked both rPTH- and PMA-induced desensitization. Thus, PK-C seemed to play a major role in rPTH-induced desensitization. Pretreatment with neither rPTH nor PMA changed the cAMP responsiveness to 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin or 100 microM forskolin. Islet activating protein failed to influence the desensitization in this cell line. PTH receptor binding, assessed by using 125I-labeled [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]PTH-(1-34) as a radioligand, was decreased along with PTH receptor numbers by pretreatment with rPTH or PMA. These data indicate that rPTH-induced homologous desensitization occurs at least in part through the activation of PK-C and that PK-C directly affects PTH receptor in UMR-106 cells. 
The benefit of the Hemonetics cell saver apparatus during cardiac surgery. This retrospective chart review of 155 patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) over a two-month period determined whether the use of a cell saver apparatus (CSA) (1) reduced or increased the requirements for homologous blood; (2) increased the incidence of post-surgical bleeding; (3) was cost-effective. Two groups of patients were identified. Group 1 (n = 99) received both CSA processed red blood cells and homologous blood components. Requirement for homologous blood products was reduced in the first 24 hr after surgery (0.5 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.8 units; P less than 0.05) when compared with Group 2 (n = 56) in whom only homologous blood products were utilized. More patients in Group 1 had no transfusion requirements (45 vs 8; P less than 0.05) and there was no increased risk of major haemorrhage. When the capital costs are included, utilization of the CSA was not cost-effective. We conclude that utilisation of a CSA was safe, with no increased risk of bleeding, reduced requirements for homologous blood transfusions, but added to the cost of the procedure. 
Abnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. 
Lumbar epidural diamorphine following thoracic surgery. A comparison of infusion and bolus administration. Twenty-two patients received a single dose of diamorphine 5 mg through a lumbar epidural catheter before thoracic surgery. The patients were transferred after surgery to a high dependency unit where they were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of epidural diamorphine at a rate of 1 mg/hour (group 1) or bolus doses of epidural diamorphine 5 mg on demand (group 2). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in visual analogue pain scores in the first 18 postoperative hours. Arterial carbon dioxide tension was elevated in both groups and was consistently higher in group 1 than in group 2, with a statistically significant intergroup difference 12 hours after operation. Respiratory rate was not a useful index of respiratory depression. The commonest nonrespiratory side effect was urinary retention, but the incidences of this and other minor side effects were similar in the two groups. 
Carcinoma of the prostate: MR images obtained with body coils do not accurately reflect tumor volume. MR imaging with a body coil is unreliable in directly demonstrating tumor spread through the prostatic capsule. However, the likelihood of extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer rises with increasing tumor volume. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MR with a body coil in diagnosing capsular penetration indirectly via an estimation of prostatic tumor volumes. Twenty-six patients with proved prostatic cancer that was clinically confined to the gland underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy and whole-mount pathologic sectioning of the specimen. Twenty of 31 lesions prospectively outlined on the MR images corresponded to cancers outlined on the pathology slides, and tumor volumes were calculated by using a voxel summation technique. On MR, tumor volume was underestimated in 11 of 20 cases and overestimated in nine of 20 cases. Only two of 20 size estimates based on MR findings were within 10% of actual tumor volume. Overlap in MR tumor volumes was significant between lesions with and without capsular penetration at microscopy. Factors contributing to inaccuracies in measurements of tumor volume on MR images included the variable histologic make-up of the tumors. Our results show that, although knowledge of the size of a prostatic lesion is important in predicting the behavior of the tumor, MR imaging with a body coil is not reliable for accurate estimation of tumor volume. 
Purification of parathyroid hypertensive factor from plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) is a newly described hypertensive factor that may be related to elevation of blood pressure in 30-40% of North American essential hypertensive patients. PHF is also found in several animal models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats. Plasma collected from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was used in the present study for purification of PHF. Plasma was dialyzed at a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa, and then ultrafiltered at a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. PHF activity, as determined by bioassay (characteristic delayed hypertensive response in normotensive rat) was retained in the fraction that was greater than 1 kDa and less than 5 kDa. Dialyzed and ultrafiltered SHR plasma was fractionated by molecular-exclusion chromatography, either with Bio-Gel P-6 liquid chromatography, or TSK 2000 SW HPLC. The biological activity was detected in a discrete region corresponding to a molecular mass of 2.5-3 kDa. When the molecular-exclusion fraction was subsequently fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, biological activity was located in a single discrete peak, which did not occur in plasma from normotensive rats prepared in a similar manner. The biologically active fraction of PHF was inactivated by trypsin; this and its UV spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide structure. 
Nasal schwannoma. A 36-year-old man with a nasal septal mass is presented. The diagnosis of a benign neoplasm arising from peripheral nerve Schwann cells was made by excisional biopsy. A benign nerve sheath tumor may be either a schwannoma or neurofibroma. Schwannomas may be distinguished from neurofibroma by clinical and histologic criteria. Malignant degeneration and intracranial extension may complicate the course of a nasal schwannoma. Complete excision is the preferred therapy. 
Essential fatty acid deficiency associated with the use of a medium-chain-triglyceride infant formula in pediatric hepatobiliary disease. Serum phospholipid fatty acid patterns were determined by gas chromatography in four infants with hepatobiliary disease receiving a formula with a high content of medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT) oil. All four infants demonstrated signs of essential fatty acid deficiency, characterized by decreased arachidonic acid and increased palmitoleic and oleic acids. All had substantial concentrations of the pathologic triene 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid. Three of four had decreased linoleic acid concentrations and abnormal ratios of triene to tetraene (5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid), greater than 0.38. One patient may have experienced growth failure due to abnormal essential fatty acid status. Infants with the potential for fat malabsorption should only receive MCT-oil feedings with well above the generally recommended requirements for linoleic acid (3% of total caloric intake). 
Postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia. A technique for relief of postoperative pain following major extremity surgery. A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities. 
Extracellular binding sites of IgA anti-jejunal antibodies on normal small bowel detected by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA deposition in the papillary dermis and in the lamina propria of the small bowel. In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA. 
Amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, but little is known about its causes or consequences. We investigated 12 young women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease and amenorrhoea and compared them with 11 healthy age matched controls studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. None of the patients had raised serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone suggesting primary gonadal failure, but the variance in serum concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol, prolactin, and luteinising hormone were significantly greater in chronic liver disease patients than control subjects (p less than 0.01). Seven of the 12 chronic liver disease patients had low serum luteinising hormone concentrations, and compared with controls these patients also had significantly reduced median values of oestradiol (64 pmol/l), testosterone (1.1 nmol/l), and follicle stimulating hormone, and were significantly underweight as assessed by skinfold thickness measurements (all comparisons p less than 0.025). In the group with chronic liver disease skinfold thickness was significantly correlated with serum luteinising hormone (p less than 0.02). The five patients with normal serum luteinising hormone had higher median values of both oestradiol (237 pmol/l) and testosterone (3.0 nmol/l) than the control subjects (oestradiol: 113 pmol/l, testosterone: 1.9 nmol/l) but were not more obese or hirsute. Amenorrhoea was unrelated to the duration or severity of liver disease. The metacarpal cortical bone area (an index of bone density) was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhoea (p less than 0.02). We conclude that amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease arises from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and can occur at any stage. 
Computer-assisted superimposition of magnetic resonance and high-resolution technetium-99m-HMPAO and thallium-201 SPECT images of the brain. A method for registering three-dimensional CT, MR, and PET data sets that require no special patient immobilization or other precise positioning measures was adapted to high-resolution SPECT and MRI and was applied in 14 subjects (five normal volunteers, four patients with dementia (Alzheimer's disease), two patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and three patients with focal lesions (stroke, arachnoid cyst and head trauma]. T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy. 
Survival of patients with dementia. The evidence on survival in dementia is summarized. There are no reliable data on survival after onset of dementia or after first contact with medical services. People with dementia in outpatient clinics and nursing homes have 2-year survival rates of 75% (range 60%-95%) and 50% (range 30%-65%), respectively. Differences in survival between patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) are small. Women in nursing homes have a better prognosis than men (2-year survival rates, 60% vs 40%). Dementia patients have a considerable excess mortality when compared to the vital statistics. There is no evidence for improvement of survival rates during recent decades. Recommendations for future studies are made. 
Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty of lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty BACKGROUND. Excimer laser coronary angioplasty is a new, investigational technique for treating coronary artery stenoses. Initial reports have demonstrated acute efficacy and relative safety of this procedure, but have not addressed the effect of lesion type on acute success and complication rates. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the first 100 patients undergoing percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty at our institution, acute laser success was obtained in 84% and procedural success was obtained in 94%. There were six acute closures during laser angioplasty and one myocardial infarction. Two patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery. Sixty-five percent of patients had lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty because of lesion morphology (tubular, diffuse, or chronic total occlusion) or ostial location. There were 10 tubular stenoses, 29 diffuse lesions, 18 chronic total occlusions, and eight ostial lesions, including five aorto-ostial lesions. In this nonideal subgroup, the acute success rate with laser was 86% (72% of chronic total occlusions and 91% of non-totally occluded lesions), and the procedural success rate was 94%. There were three acute occlusions during laser angioplasty but no myocardial infarctions, emergency bypass surgeries, or deaths. One coronary artery perforation occurred without clinical sequelae. Laser angioplasty was successful in four of six lesions (67%) in which balloon angioplasty had failed. Laser success was obtained in 10 of 11 (91%) moderately or heavily calcified stenoses. Eight eccentric lesions and two lesions on bends were successfully treated without dissection or perforation. No side branch occlusions occurred in the 15 patients in whom one or more major branches originated within the lesion treated. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 47% of cases, usually to obtain a larger final luminal diameter. Need for adjunctive balloon angioplasty decreased to 36% after a larger (2.0 mm) laser catheter became available. Twenty-eight percent of the 105 lesions treated were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification type A, 47% were type B, and 25% were type C. Laser and procedural successes were obtained in 83% and 97% of type A, 88% and 96% of type B, and 85% and 88% of type C lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. In our initial experience, excimer laser angioplasty was found to be acutely effective and safe therapy for lesions identified as not ideal for balloon angioplasty. This technique may provide a useful adjunct or alternative to balloon angioplasty in selected patients. 
The postmenopausal adnexal mass: correlation between ultrasonic and pathologic findings. One hundred two postmenopausal women underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of adnexal masses before surgery. Twenty-nine (28%) had malignant tumors and 73 (72%) had benign tumors. Two of 33 patients with a "simple cyst" smaller than 5 cm in diameter by ultrasound had malignant ovarian tumors. Twenty-two of the 52 women (42%) with "complex masses" by ultrasound and five of the 17 (29%) with solid tumors had ovarian cancer. For predicting malignancy in ovarian tumors, abdominal ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 94%. If a negative sonogram had been relied upon, 6% of malignant ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women might have been missed. 
A comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. Five patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation are reported. Four had severe clinical symptoms, whereas 1 was asymptomatic. Mechanical ventilatory support was necessary in 1 because of respiratory distress. Pneumocystis carinii infection developed in 4 patients within the first 4 postoperative months, and 1 patient had clinical disease 1 year after transplantation with a recurrence 9 months later. All were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole either orally or intravenously (10 to 20 mg.kg-1.day-1 of trimethoprim). All patients recovered from infection and received the same drug prophylactically for 2 to 20 months after the infection. All patients are doing well after Pneumocystis carinii infection except 1 who died after an acute myocardial infarction 4 years after infection. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective agent for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. 
Detection of single copies of Epstein-Barr virus in paraffin wax sections by non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. A highly sensitive non-isotopic in situ hybridisation technique was developed for the localisation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in paraffin wax embedded tissue sections. The method uses a repeated sequence of the EBV genome as a probe, labelled with the novel reporter molecule, digoxigenin. The method can identify individual copies of EBV by detection of both EBV DNA and highly localised RNA transcripts. A combination of careful proteolytic digestion of tissue sections, high temperature denaturation of probe and target DNA, and sensitive immunocytochemical detection are used to attain single copy sensitivity. The technique is quicker and simpler to perform than some other methods used for the identification of EBV, and provides simultaneous morphological information which cannot be obtained by methods using tissue extracts. This method permits the investigation of the role of EBV in neoplastic conditions of lymphoid and epithelial cells, and may prove valuable in determining the sites of latent virus in healthy subjects. 
Intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis: case report. The authors present a case of intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis. Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography proved valuable in locating the lesion, thus facilitating surgical intervention. With the preoperative diagnosis established and the severity of the meningocele known, the surgeons safely employed a subpleural approach at thoracotomy. 
Mechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Cyclosporine is a common immunosuppressive agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplants and the treatment of some immunological diseases. It has been established that treatment with cyclosporine can cause a patient to develop hypertension within a few weeks of treatment. This review will examine this effect and effective ways to treat it. 
Mucosal and systemic IgA anti-gliadin antibody in celiac disease. Contrasting patterns of response in serum, saliva, and intestinal secretions. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody estimation is a recognized screening method for celiac disease. However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control. 
Intraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied. After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management and survival statistics in the USSR. Three hundred and ninety-three patients with IIB osteosarcoma were treated at the author's institution between 1955 and 1986. In the first stage of the study, 88 patients were treated with surgery only. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 7%. In the second stage of the study, the efficacy of preventive chemotherapy after radical surgery was studied in 55 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 34.4%. In the third stage of the study, the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of preoperative treatment, limb-saving surgery, and preventive chemotherapy was studied in 66 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 35.5%. The authors examined results in 21 patients with Grade IV responses to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and morphogenic changes after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%. In the fourth stage of the study (conducted in 1986), two regimens of preoperative chemotherapy were initiated. The first regimen consists of intraarterial platinum infusions to patients with lower extremity bone damage. The second regimen consists of high-dose methotrexate infusions. The preliminary conclusion is that primary tumor damage is significantly more marked after intraarterial cisplatin infusion. 
Single motor end-plates in myasthenia gravis and LEMS at different firing rates. The jitter and frequency of blocking was studied at single motor end-plates in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), using single fiber EMG (SFEMG) with axonal microstimulation at rates varying from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality. 
Treatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate. Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A). Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B). Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses. Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions. Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B. There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications. We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant. 
Proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death in young patients receiving encainide and flecainide. The Pediatric Electrophysiology Group The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease. 
Effect of plasma glucose on infarct size in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Although hyperglycemia has been shown to consistently exacerbate ischemia brain injury following global or diffuse cerebral ischemia, the effect of hyperglycemia in unilateral focal cerebral ischemia remains controversial. Recent advances in thrombolytic therapy have enhanced the clinical significance of postischemic reperfusion. We studied the effect of plasma glucose on ischemic brain injury in a newly developed focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. Rats allowed free access to food until ischemic insult developed intra- and postischemic hyperglycemia and cortical infarction. Rats fasted for 24 hours had blunted hyperglycemic responses. Infarct volumes were correspondingly smaller. The protective effect of fasting was partially abolished by glucose loading during ischemia to induce intra-ischemic hyperglycemia. Glucose loading immediately or 3 hours after focal cerebral ischemia did not significantly alter the protective effect of fasting. Insulin treatment in fed rats before ischemia also reduced hyperglycemic responses and infarct volume. Timing of insulin treatment was also critical in the reduction of ischemic injury. These findings indicate that plasma glucose during the period of ischemia is an important determinant of brain injury in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and there is a therapeutic window for normalization of plasma glucose to be efficacious. 
The role of albumin in human physiology and pathophysiology, Part III: Albumin and disease states. The serum albumin level is one of several clinical parameters of the status of general health. There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted. 
Blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Framingham Study--30 years of follow-up Data from 30 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Study cohort of 5,070 men and women aged 30-62 years who were first examined during the period 1948-1952 and who were free of cardiovascular disease reveal that blood pressure is a strong and consistent predictor of the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure. Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms, and heart enlargement as shown by x-ray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk; heart enlargement by x-ray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure. 
Crohn's colitis complicated by superimposed invasive amebic colitis. The clinical characteristics and endoscopic appearance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be very similar to those of amebic colitis. Physicians, especially in areas in which amebiasis is endemic, are familiar with this difficulty. Moreover, in individual cases, it may even be impossible to distinguish between the two conditions, since stool specimens, bowel biopsies, and serological studies may be negative for Entamoeba histolytica, even in the presence of invasive amebic colitis. Invasive amebiasis may rarely be superimposed on IBD, which further complicates the issue. We report here a young patient with a 7-yr history of Crohn's colitis proven histologically who developed invasive amebic colitis during steroid and 6-mercaptopurine treatment for active disease. Stool specimens, mucosal biopsies, and serological studies were negative for E. histolytica, and the diagnosis was established on pathological examination of a surgically resected bowel. Anti-amebic therapy should be considered in endemic areas in cases of persistent IBD. 
Malignant melanoma occurring in those aged under 30 in the west of Scotland 1979-1986: a study of incidence, clinical features, pathological features and survival. The study population consisted of the 95 patients who presented with cutaneous malignant melanoma in the west of Scotland between 1979 and 1986 and who were aged under 30 at the time of diagnosis. Over this 7-year period, 1299 melanomas were diagnosed in all age groups in this geographical area, increasing in incidence by 82% from 135 in 1979 to 246 in 1986. The proportion of melanomas diagnosed before the patients' thirtieth birthday remained constant at 6%. None were diagnosed in the under-15 age-group, and none developed on giant congenital naevi. Forty-two of the 95 melanomas (44%) in the under-30 group developed on a small naevus present either from birth or early childhood. These melanomas were thicker than those apparently developing on normal skin, but once controlled for tumour thickness and sex the presence of a pre-existing naevus did not affect 5-year survival. The overall 5-year survival was 76% with poorer survival associated with thicker tumours and male sex. This study suggests that small early onset naevi may have a higher potential for post-pubertal malignant change than has been previously recognized. 
Haemodynamic changes during the apnoea test for diagnosis of brain death. Haemodynamic responses to the apnoea test for the diagnosis of brain death were investigated in nine patients with severe head injury or cerebrovascular disease. To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia. No respiratory movement was seen in any patient. Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02. Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients. Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change. Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal. These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia. However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia. In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg. 
Traumatic facial injuries with steering wheel loading. This study was conducted to evaluate the biomechanics of facial fractures caused by steering wheel loading. Twelve intact fresh human cadaver heads were impacted onto standard or energy-absorbing steering wheels with a custom-designed and validated vertical-drop apparatus. Either zygoma was impacted once at a velocity of 2.0-6.9 m/s. The specimens were oriented to permit a direct comparison between pretest and posttest radiography, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT images. Bone mineral content was determined, and biomechanical forces, accelerations, and deformations were recorded. More severe fractures were associated with higher forces on the zygoma. With increasing velocities, fractures initiated at the zygomatic region propagated to other unilateral regions such as the mandible and orbit or to the contralateral side. Less facial trauma was observed with energy-absorbing steering wheels compared with standard wheels at similar impact velocities. Bone mineral content did not correlate well with specimen age or with fracture severity. Clinically significant fractures were identifiable on 3-D CT images. The flexibility of 3-D CT in evaluating the spatial extent of facial abnormalities in different orientations may have significant impact in planning surgical procedures. 
Erythropoietin concentrations in obstructive sleep apnoea. Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and a normal haemoglobin concentration underwent nocturnal studies during which oxyhaemoglobin saturation was recorded continuously with an ear oximeter and serum erythropoietin concentration was measured hourly by means of a radioimmunoassay. Serum erythropoietin concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the study despite falls in oxyhaemaglobin saturation in individuals to 33-78%. There was no relation between the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia and serum erythropoietin concentrations. The brief cyclical episodes of hypoxaemia typical of obstructive sleep apnoea may not be a sufficient stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. 
A frameless, armless navigational system for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Technical note. A computer-assisted neurosurgical navigational system has been developed which displays intraoperative manipulation on the preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance (MR) images. The system consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a personal computer, and an image-processing unit. Utilizing recently developed magnetic field modulation technology, the three-dimensional digitizer determines the spatial position and orientation angles of the resin probe, triangle-shaped pointer, or suction tube with a small attached magnetic field sensor. Four fiducial markers on the scalp were used to translate the spatial data of the probe onto the preoperative CT scans or MR images of the patient. With this frameless, armless navigational system, CT or MR-imaging stereotaxy can be applied to conventional open neurosurgery without limiting the operative field or interfering with the surgical procedures. 
Diclofenac delays healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions. Double-blind, placebo-controlled endoscopic study in healthy volunteers. The effects of the water-soluble and delayed-release formulations of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac, on the healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions were compared in a double-blind, double cross-over, placebo-controlled endoscopic study conducted in 14 healthy volunteers. Severe endoscopic lesions (petechiae, erosions, ulcers, and esophageal candidiasis) were found only in the group taking the soluble formulation of diclofenac (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). The endoscopic healing of biopsies at one week was delayed by both preparations in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). Neither formulation produced significantly more histological inflammation or minor endoscopic lesions (erythema, red striae) than placebo. Both formulations were equally well tolerated and produced no more symptoms than placebo. This study suggests that soluble diclofenac acts topically to delay gastroduodenal healing and produce gastroduodenal injury; it thus provides a model for future studies of the production, perpetuation, and healing of peptic lesions. 
Progressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. 
Combined evaluation of total and functional liver plasma flows and intrahepatic shunting A diagnostic protocol was studied, designed to evaluate the main parameters of liver circulation in man. A water solution of D-sorbitol (S) and indocyanine green (ICG) was infused intravenously in six controls and nine cirrhotics. Steady-state renal and hepatic S clearances as well as hepatic ICG clearance were calculated. In controls the values (mean +/- SD) of the independent measurements of S and ICG hepatic clearance were 978 +/- 107 and 519 +/- 142 ml/min, respectively, while in cirrhotic patients they were 554 +/- 238 and 231 +/- 90 ml/min. Owing to the kinetic properties of S, its hepatic clearance may be regarded as a measure of functional liver plasma flow (FLPF). The total liver plasma flow (TLPF) values (mean +/- SD), calculated according to Fick's principle, were 1091 +/- 157 ml/min (S method) and 1033 +/- 153 ml/min (ICG method) in controls, and 1251 +/- 554 and 1284 +/- 677 ml/min in cirrhotics. In controls, FLPF was found to be very close to TLPF. In cirrhotic patients the difference between TLPF and FLPF (ranging from 169 to 2093 ml/min when measured by S method) was considered as an approximate estimate of intrahepatic shunting. The procedure is safe and simple and may add a new dimension to the investigation of hepatic circulation. 
Treatment of superior vena cava thrombosis with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Thrombotic occlusion of the superior vena cava is an uncommon but serious complication of chronic indwelling venous catheters. Several reports have shown thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase or urokinase to be effective in the treatment of this condition. We report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis in a 53-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy for breast carcinoma through a subcutaneously implanted venous access catheter who was successfully treated with peripheral infusion of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA). 
The aphasic isolate. A clinical-CT scan study of a particularly severe subgroup of global aphasics. This paper outlines the clinical and CT scan features of a subtype of global aphasia, characterized by an extreme loss of communicative abilities, verbal as well as nonverbal. Three to four weeks after a left hemisphere stroke, 17 patients were completely unable to communicate with people addressing them. Though there were differences in their willingness to interact with the environment, they were characterized by complete loss of speech output and by inaccessibility to any kind of message, whether given verbally or through gestures. Patients who survived were reassessed 6 and 12 mos later and half of them were still found in a state of complete communicative isolation. The remainder had somewhat improved, but remained globally aphasic. The attempt to find a CT scan basis for this picture was disappointing. Only 35% of patients had a lesional pattern in agreement with the traditional view that ascribes global aphasia to the involvement of Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The location of lesion in the other cases spanned from anterior cortical damage, to posterior cortical damage, to deep nuclei damage and none of the lesions that have been proposed to account for subcortical global aphasia was consistently observed. 
Clinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries. 
Hemodynamic effects of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy. BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output. 
Medical aspects of delayed convalescence. Disease and illness are not synonymous. In most instances, disease is demonstrable by anatomic, physiologic, biochemical, microbiologic, or immunologic abnormalities. Disease is a pathologic process. Not all persons with a disease are sick or ill. Symptoms of illness associated with a disease may be manifest or persist after the disease has disappeared. The absence of demonstrable disease, however, does not necessarily mean that symptoms of illness are unreal. Recovery from disease and recovery from illness are not always equated. Many factors, including personal characteristics and social circumstances, can be responsible for recovery from disease and illness. Chronic fatigue syndrome or symptoms of illness can persist in some patients but not in others after many different diseases. 
How to identify psychogenic disorders of stance and gait. A video study in 37 patients. Thirty-seven patients with psychogenic disorders of stance and gait were clinically evaluated, recorded on video, and analysed with regard to clinical phenomenology. Characteristic, suggestive and unspecific features were identified. Six characteristic features proved most valuable for diagnosis of psychogenesis, as they occurred alone or in combination in 97% of patients: (1) momentary fluctuations of stance and gait, often in response to suggestion; (2) excessive slowness or hesitation of locomotion incompatible with neurological disease; (3) "psychogenic" Romberg test with a build-up of sway amplitudes after a silent latency or with improvement by distraction; (4) uneconomic postures with wastage of muscular energy; (5) the "walking on ice" gait pattern, which is characterized by small cautious steps with fixed ankle joints; (6) sudden buckling of the knees, usually without falls. Seventy-three percent of patients had additional suggestive features. Classification into characteristic subtypes was not found useful because predominant features varied from patient to patient and occurred in various combinations. Factitious impairment of stance and gait was studied in 13 healthy drama students. Simulated gait dysfunction appeared less conspicuous and more difficult to diagnose than the clinical psychogenic disorders. 
An analysis of thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma. Pathophysiologic considerations and management recommendations. Thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma were reviewed. Clinical, imaging, and microscopic findings were integrated to develop a pathophysiologic construct and management guidelines. The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection. 
Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty: initial multicenter experience in 141 patients. Initial multicenter clinical experience with percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty is described for 158 lesions in 141 patients. Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis. 
Long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and Helicobacter pylori infection. This study investigates whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori gastritis than age-matched individuals who do not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who are also infected with H. pylori are more likely to have dyspepsia, mucosal damage, or ulcers than those who are not infected. Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection. 
Effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance in normal and asthmatic subjects. The effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance were studied in 15 healthy subjects and 30 asthmatic subjects. Respiratory resistance (impedance) was measured with the pseudo-random noise forced oscillation technique while the subjects rebreathed from a wet spirometer in a closed respiratory circuit in which end tidal carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) could be controlled. Hypercapnia was induced by partially short circuiting the carbon dioxide absorber, and hypocapnia by voluntary hyperventilation. The circulating air was saturated with water vapour and kept at body temperature and ambient pressure. A rise of end tidal PCO2 of 1 kPa caused a significant fall in respiratory resistance in both normal and asthmatic subjects (15% and 9% respectively). A fall of PCO2 of 1 kPa did not cause any significant change in impedance in the control group. In the asthmatic patients resistance increased by 13%, reactance fell by 45%, and the frequency dependence of resistance rose 240%. These findings confirm that hypocapnia may contribute to airway obstruction in asthmatic patients, even when water and heat loss are prevented. 
Gliofibroma. Case report. The case history of an infant with a large gliofibroma is presented. Gliofibromas are rare mixed glialmesenchymal tumors that have been poorly characterized. The computerized tomography appearance and a detailed light and electron microscopic description are presented, along with immunoperoxidase studies of this tumor. This case is compared with gliofibromas described elsewhere in the literature. 
Midgut volvulus in infants: diagnosis with US. Work in progress. The authors present findings from ultrasound (US) studies that can alert sonologists to the possibility of midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus in neonates and infants. A fluid-filled, distended duodenum seen at US examination in infants is a nonspecific sign of duodenal obstruction, as well as one of the signs of midgut malrotation. In addition, dilated, thick-walled bowel loops, mainly to the right of the spine, and peritoneal fluid were found at abdominal US examinations of three infants with midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus. In one infant with uncomplicated midgut malrotation, only signs of duodenal obstruction were present. The findings at US of duodenal obstruction associated with thickened bowel loops to the right of the spine and peritoneal fluid should lead the sonologist to suspect midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus, a potentially fatal condition, and an upper gastrointestinal series should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis. 
Optimal dose of neuroleptic in acute schizophrenia. A controlled study of the neuroleptic threshold and higher haloperidol dose. After individual determination of neuroleptic threshold (NT) doses of haloperidol, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Research Diagnostic Criteria) were treated openly at such doses (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for 2 weeks. Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects. 
Physiology and pathophysiology of colonic motor activity (2). The basic motor function of the colon is to mix and knead its contents, propel them slowly in the caudad direction, hold them in the distal colon until defecation, and provide a strong propulsive force during defecation. Infrequently, it also produces mass movements in the proximal colon. These motor functions are achieved in most species by three different types of contractions: the individual phasic contractions that include the short- and long-duration contractions, organized groups of contractions that include the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes, and special propulsive contractions (giant migrating contractions). The spatial and temporal patterns of all of these contractions are controlled by myogenic, neural, and chemical control mechanisms. The individual phasic contractions are highly disorganized in time and space in the colon. For this reason, they are effective in mixing and kneading and slow distal propulsion. The underlying cause of the disorganization of short duration contractions is the irregularity in the frequency and waveshape of colonic electrical control activity and its phase unlocking throughout the colon. The individual contractions in many species occur in cyclic bursts called contractile states. At least in some species, these contractile states exhibit mostly caudad and sometimes orad migration. However, there are also nonmigrating or randomly migrating contractile states in the colon. These two patterns of contractile states are called colonic migrating motor complexes and colonic nonmigrating motor complexes, respectively. The giant migrating contractions provide the strong propulsive force for defecation and mass movements. The neural control of colonic contractions is organized at three levels--enteric, autonomic, and central. The enteric nervous system contains cholinergic and peptidergic neurons and plays a major role in the control of colonic contractions. The autonomic nerves, the vagi, pelvic, lumbar colonic, hypogastric, and splanchnic nerves, seem to continuously monitor the state of the colon and provide a modulatory input when necessary. These nerves play a major role in the reflexive control of colonic motor function. The voluntary input from the central nervous system coordinates the motor activity of the colon, rectum, anal canal and sphincters for orderly evacuation of feces during defecation. The role of acetylcholine, nonadrenaline, and the yet to be completely identified nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter, possibly VIP, in the control of contractions is fairly well established. Besides these, there are several other peptides and chemicals that are localized in the colonic wall; their physiological roles remain unknown. Colonic motor activity has been studied in several disease states. The findings have not always been consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Assessment of the role of the glucocorticoid system in aging processes and in the action of food restriction. The Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis of Aging and the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development with age of hyperadrenocorticism were investigated. A longitudinal life span study of the daily concentration pattern of plasma corticosterone was conducted in male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum or restricted to 60% of the mean food intake of ad libitum fed rats. In another group of ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats, the influence of age on the response of plasma corticosterone levels to restraint stress was measured as was the time course of the return of plasma corticosterone to basal levels following the stress. The findings do not support the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development of hyperadrenocorticism with advancing age. They also indicate that the Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis does not describe a major aspect of the aging processes. Rather, the results suggest the possibility that a lifetime of daily periods of mild hyperadrenocorticism may, if anything, retard the aging processes. 
Effects of calcium-free solution, calcium antagonists, and the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on mechanical responses of skeletal muscle from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if alteration in the function of the dihydropyridine receptor may in turn modify halothane-induced contractures in muscle bundles from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). The effects of Ca(2+)-free Krebs Ringer (KR) solution, 5 microM verapamil, 5 microM nifedipine, and 10 microM of the Ca2+ agonist BAY K 8644 on halothane-induced contracture were therefore investigated. The halothane-induced contracture was prevented in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and significantly reduced in the presence of verapamil or nifedipine. BAY K 8644 significantly enhanced the 0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-vol % halothane-induced contracture in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. When BAY K 8644 was dissolved in Ca(2+)-free KR solution, no contracture was observed in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. These results on cut MH-susceptible human muscle bundles support the hypothesis that halothane-induced contracture in MH can be modified by the binding of Ca2+ agonists or antagonists to the dihydropyridine receptor. The role of Ca2+ entry phenomena remains unclear, but the results suggest that extracellular Ca2+ is required to reprime or to bind to some sites of the dihydropyridine receptors. 
Regulation of MHC class II antigen expression. Opposing effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR and Ia expression depends on the maturation and differentiation stage of the cell. MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes. TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines. On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression. Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated. Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages. In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion. These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha. Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages. 
A comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
A relationship between proteinuria and acute tubulointerstitial disease in rats with experimental nephrotic syndrome. The relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and proteinuria was characterized in experimental nephrosis in rats. In one group, proteinuria induced by aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) was reduced by using an 8% protein diet and adding the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the drinking water. Two control groups were injected with saline and PAN, respectively, and fed a 27% protein diet. The first group had significantly reduced albuminuria and a definite attenuation of tubular cell injury. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of interstitial macrophages and albuminuria. The beneficial effect was reproduced by dietary-protein restriction alone, whereas ACE inhibition alone had an insignificant effect on the degree of proteinuria. Depletion of circulating T lymphocytes in one group of nephrotic rats eliminated interstitial lymphocytes but did not affect interstitial macrophage influx. Inhibition of the in situ proliferation of resident interstitial macrophages by unilateral kidney irradiation failed to change the intensity of the macrophage infiltration. Treatment of rats with sodium maleate produced proximal tubular cell toxicity but interstitial inflammation did not develop, suggesting that the latter is not a nonspecific response to tubular injury. These studies demonstrate a strong relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and the severity of proteinuria in experimental nephrosis. 
The dizzy patient: etiologic treatment. The basis for the vestibular complaint in dizzy patients should be viewed as having an etiology rather than a description of its clinical presentation. Effective treatment of vestibular disorders is based on the stabilization of the vestibular abnormality, to allow for central vestibular compensation. While not all of the etiologies for dizziness have been described, there are effective etiologic treatments available. These fit into categories of neurotransmitters, blood sugar and blood fat control, hormones, minerals, and treatments for autoimmune dizziness. 
Contractile response of aorta to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in Ca(2+)-free medium is reduced in spontaneous hypertension. Vascular responses of aortic rings to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine (Phe) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied in Ca(2+)-containing medium and Ca(2+)-free medium plus 50 mumol/L EGTA. Although there was no difference in the sustained force development between SHR and WKY vessels in response to 100 mmol/L KCl or 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-containing medium, the transient contractile response to 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium was substantially smaller in SHR compared to that in WKY. Subsequent addition of 2.5 mmol/L Ca2+ restored the sustained contractile response to a similar level in both SHR and WKY vessels. The transient contractile response to Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium containing EGTA, presumably due to the release of intracellular Ca2+, decreased progressively with preincubation time in Ca(2+)-free medium, indicating intracellular Ca2+ depletion. Such a temporal change of aortic response was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. The subsequent response to Ca2+ repletion in the presence of Phe, on the other hand, increased progressively with Ca(2+)-depletion period and was higher in SHR than in WKY. The rate of relaxation after washout of Phe was slower in SHR aorta compared to WKY aorta. These results, together with our earlier findings, collectively suggest that the previous known deficiency in Ca2+ pumping mechanisms of vascular muscle microsomes leading to a reduced functional size of intracellular Ca2+ pool may account for the smaller contractile response of SHR aorta to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in Ca(2+)-free medium and the slower rate of relaxation. 
The occurrence of epilepsy and febrile seizures in Virginian and Norwegian twins. Twin studies provide an efficient method for examining the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of disorders such as epilepsy. Population-based twin registries are especially valuable for studies of this type since effects of reporting and self-selection biases on the resulting data are minimized. Among 14,352 twin pairs contained in the Virginia and Norwegian twin panels for whom questionnaire information was available, there was a history of epilepsy in one or both members of 286 pairs; febrile seizures were reported in 257 pairs. Analyses of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences in concordance rates between Virginian and Norwegian twins for either epilepsy or febrile seizures. Probandwise concordance rates for epilepsy were 0.19 in monozygotic twins and 0.07 in dizygotic twins. Analogous rates for febrile seizures were 0.33 (monozygotic) and 0.11 (dizygotic). These results provide further evidence that genetic factors do have a role in the expression of epilepsy and febrile seizures. 
Retinal migraine, chorea, and retinal artery thrombosis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report the case of a patient with the unusual combination of migraine, chorea, and retinal arterial thrombosis along with laboratory evidence of autoimmunity. In the absence of systemic lupus erythematosus, the clinical manifestations suggest the presence of the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 
Inability of coronary blood flow reserve measurements to assess the efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the first 24 hours in unselected patients. To determine functional and anatomic changes in the first 24 hours after coronary angioplasty, we studied at random 15 patients (9 men, mean age 60 years) who underwent coronary angioplasty of 16 coronary arteries. Quantitative coronary angiography and coronary flow reserve measurements from digitized coronary angiograms were performed before, immediately after, and 24 hours after coronary angioplasty. Calculated were the minimal luminal diameter, obstruction area, and percentage diameter stenosis from two preferably orthogonal projections. Prior myocardial infarction in the myocardial region of interest was present in four patients. Seven patients had multivessel disease. Collateral vessels supplying the compromised flow region were observed in three patients. Six patients had refractory unstable angina pectoris. After coronary angioplasty, angiographically visible dissection was noted in six patients, whereas side branch occlusion was observed in one. Minimal luminal diameter before, immediately after, and 24 hours after was 0.93 +/- 0.18 mm, 1.53 +/- 28 mm, and 1.53 +/- 0.21 mm, respectively; obstruction area was 0.70 +/- 0.26 mm2, 1.92 +/- 0.69 mm2, and 1.87 +/- 0.51 mm2, respectively; diameter stenosis was 60.4 +/- 8.0%, 36.8 +/- 11.4%, and 37.6 +/- 5.3%, respectively. The coronary flow reserve (lower limit of normal with this technique 3.4) was essentially the same before and immediately after coronary angioplasty (1.26 +/- 0.59 vs 1.30 +/- 0.42, p = NS) with a slight improvement to 1.78 +/- 0.90 (p less than 0.05) 1 day later. Coronary artery dimensions correlated poorly with coronary blood flow reserve before and after angioplasty. 
Posterior cortical dementia with alexia: neurobehavioural, MRI, and PET findings. A progressive disorder of relatively focal but asymmetric biposterior dysfunction is described in a 54 year old right handed male. Initial clinical features included letter-by-letter alexia, visual anomia, acalculia, mild agraphia, constructional apraxia, and visuospatial compromise. Serial testing demonstrated relentless deterioration with additional development of transcortical sensory aphasia, Gerstmann's tetrad, and severe visuoperceptual impairment. Amnesia was not an early clinical feature. Judgment, personality, insight, and awareness remained preserved throughout most of the clinical course. Extinction in the right visual field to bilateral stimulation was the sole neurological abnormality. Early CT was normal and late MRI showed asymmetrical bioccipitoparietal atrophy with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Results from positron emission tomography (PET) showed bilaterally asymmetric (left greater than right) occipitotemporoparietal hypometabolism. The metabolic decrement was strikingly asymmetric with a 50% reduction in glucose consumption confined to the left occipital cortex. The picture of occipitotemporoparietal compromise verified by MRI, PET, and neurobehavioural testing would be unusual for such degenerative dementias as Alzheimer's (AD) and Pick's disease, although atypical AD with predominant occipital lobe involvement cannot be excluded. This case supports the concepts of posterior cortical dementia (PCD) as a clinically distinct entity and for the first time documents its corresponding metabolic deficit using PET. 
Evaluation of salvage surgery in heavily irradiated cancer of the buccal mucosa. This report describes the authors' experience with salvage surgery in 78 patients with carcinoma of the buccal mucosa who failed after high-dose radical radiation therapy at Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. Forty-four patients (56%) required a hemimandibulectomy for adequate tumor clearance. Fifty-four patients (69%) required a primary reconstructive procedure for wound closure. Follow-up periods ranged from 28 months to 63 months (median follow-up, 41 months). Thirteen patients (17%) developed nonfatal postoperative complications. Thirty-one patients recurred after surgery, five of whom were again salvaged by further surgery. Overall, the recurrence rate was 36%. Most of the recurrences (26/31) were at the primary site. The overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival after salvage surgery was 59.7%. T stage of the recurrent tumor and its skin infiltration emerged as factors which significantly influenced disease-free survival (P less than 0.05). 
Reactive astrogliosis is widespread in the subcortical white matter of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain. Widespread astrogliosis exists in the subcortical white matter in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As revealed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining, the gliosis has the morphological properties of an active process. It is present in the midfrontal, inferior parietal, temporal, cingulate, and occipital cortices, as well as in the motor cortex. Compared to matched regions from other neurological diseases, the gliosis in ALS does not appear to be the nonspecific result of a progressive, degenerative disease. In cell number and apparent cell size, the gliosis is comparable to that present in neurological diseases known to have white matter gliosis. Cytologically, the gliosis most closely resembles that present in cases of cerebral infarction. The basis for this similarity is unknown. 
Reversibility of cardiac abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals: a serial echocardiographic study. Seventy adults who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were prospectively studied with serial echocardiography to better define the prevalence and progression of cardiac disease in such patients. Fifty outpatients (Group A), including 44 with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 6 with AIDS-related complex, and 20 additional patients (Group B) with asymptomatic HIV infection had baseline echocardiographic studies at a time when no patient had symptomatic heart disease. Follow-up studies were performed at 9 +/- 3 months in 52 patients (74%) and again at 15 +/- 3 months after baseline studies in 29 patients (41%). During the study, 22 patients (44%) in Group A and 1 patient (5%) in Group B died. Cardiac abnormalities were noted in 26 patients (52%) in Group A and 8 patients (40%) in Group B (p = NS) on initial or follow-up study. An abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 45%) or fractional shortening (less than 28%) was seen in seven patients in Group A; of these, three had normal left ventricular function on a later echocardiogram. One patient in Group B had persistent left ventricular dysfunction. All patients in Group A with left ventricular dysfunction on two serial studies died within 1 year after the initial echocardiogram. Ejection fraction did not change between baseline and two follow-up studies in either group (A: 52 +/- 9 vs. 56 +/- 9 vs. 55 +/- 5%, p = NS; B: 58 +/- 6 vs. 58 +/- 5 vs. 59 +/- 6%, p = NS). Right-sided cardiac enlargement resolved in 18 patients (44%), including 5 of 10 in Group A and 3 of 8 in Group B. 
Intestinal permeability after single dose gluten challenge in coeliac disease. The changes of intestinal permeability before and after a gluten load were studied. The study group comprised 27 patients with coeliac disease (mean age 12.3 years) and 19 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Intestinal permeability was studied by measuring the urinary excretion of two sugars, lactulose and L-rhamnose, before and six hours after the ingestion of five palatable biscuits made with 50 g of gluten powder. The patients with coeliac disease had been on a gluten free diet during the previous two years. After the gluten load lactulose and L-rhamnose urinary excretion changed significantly in patients, and a significant increase in the lactulose: L-rhamnose ratio was also observed. No significant changes were observed in the controls. In view of the modification of the three biopsies diagnostic protocol made by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, permeability tests associated with single gluten challenges may be an added contribution to the accuracy of the diagnosis in childhood. 
Clinical course and outcome in class IC antiarrhythmic overdose. 120 cases of class IC antiarrhythmic overdose, including propafenone, flecainide, ajmaline and prajmaline overdose, were evaluated with respect to clinical course, therapy and outcome. Whereas drug overdose in general has an overall mortality of less than 1%, intoxication with antiarrhythmic drugs of class IC was associated with a mean mortality of 22.5%. Nausea, which occurred within the first 30 minutes after ingestion, was the earliest symptom. Spontaneous vomiting probably led to self-detoxication in about half the patients. Cardiac symptoms including bradycardia and, less frequently, tachyrhythmia occurred after about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Therapeutic measures included administration of activated charcoal, gastric lavage and a saline laxative, catecholamines, and in some patients, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker and hemoperfusion. Fatal outcome was mainly due to cardiac conduction disturbances progressing to electromechanical dissociation or asystolia. Resuscitation, which had to be performed in 29 patients, was successful in only two of them. No correlation was found between fatal outcome, the type of antiarrhythmic, and ingested dose. Since a specific treatment is not available and resuscitive procedures including sodium bicarbonate and insertion of a pacemaker are of limited therapeutic value, early diagnosis and primary detoxification are most important for prevention of fatal outcome. 
A pilot study of sphincter-sparing management of adenocarcinoma of the rectum. After analysis of 26 prospectively accrued patients with distal rectal adenocarcinomas who underwent sphincter preservation treatment, we have concluded that tumors that invade only the submucosa can safely be treated with surgery alone and that tumors that invade the muscularis or further can be safely treated with surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy. None of the patients had either local or distant recurrence, with a median follow-up of 21 months. All patients have been fully continent. The results, although preliminary, imply that resection of distal rectal adenocarcinoma with sphincter preservation, and adjuvant therapy when appropriate, have achieved local and distant control equal to the conventional Miles' abdominoperineal resection, but without the need for a permanent colostomy. 
Value of transesophageal echocardiography as an adjunct to transthoracic echocardiography in evaluation of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis. To determine if transesophageal echocardiography provides better visualization of valvular vegetations than transthoracic echocardiography, we used both methods to evaluate 24 consecutive patients (mean age, 54 years; 15 female patients and nine male patients) referred for symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Ten of the 24 patients had one or more valvular prostheses. Echocardiograms were classified as positive or negative based on visualization of valvular vegetations or abscesses. Of ten patients with a final diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on extended follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography was positive in five patients. Transesophageal echocardiography not only yielded abnormal findings in all ten of these patients, but also revealed additional information in four of the five patients with abnormal transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. Among the 14 patients who, on subsequent follow-up, were found not to have infectious endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography was normal in 13 and falsely abnormal in one. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infectious endocarditis in any of these patients. The ten patients who were determined to have infectious endocarditis all had positive blood cultures and no alternative cause for their clinical presentation; in seven patients in this group who underwent operative or postmortem evaluation, infectious endocarditis was confirmed. All patients without infectious endocarditis were demonstrated to have other causes for their clinical presentation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly valuable test in the work-up of patients with suspected infectious endocarditis, especially those patients with inconclusive or normal transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography may be of benefit to patients with previously documented infectious endocarditis and a complicated clinical course in whom additional cardiac lesions are suspected but not demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography. 
C5a, cutaneous mast cells, and inflammation: in vitro and in vivo studies in a murine model. To evaluate further the interactions of C5a and mast cells in cutaneous inflammation, the ability of human native C5a (nC5a) (10 to 500 ng/ml) and human recombinant C5a (rC5a) (10 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) to induce histamine release from purified BALB/c cutaneous mast cells (CMC) and peritoneal mast cells (PMC) was analyzed. It was found that nC5a induced histamine release from CMC but not from PMC, with a maximal net release at 250 ng/ml nC5a (22.8 +/- 2.6%). Kinetic experiments demonstrated that nC5a-induced maximal net histamine release occurred 5 min after the presentation of this stimulus (25.8 +/- 6.0%). Using rC5a and CMC, dose-response studies indicated a maximal net release of 7.0 +/- 1.7% at rC5a of 10 ng/ml, and kinetic studies showed a maximal net release at 5 min of incubation (12.9 +/- 1.6%). Release induced by rC5a was calcium-dependent, and peaked at 30 degrees C. These results indicate that functional heterogeneity exists between the CMC and the PMC of BALB/c mice, that C5a is a relevant stimulus for characterization of this heterogeneity, and that CMC from these animals can serve as a convenient in vitro model for the study of human C5a-mast cell interactions. In vivo, injections of nC5a (25-100 ng) and rC5a (25-100 ng) into the skin of BALB/c mice induced an increase in cutaneous vasopermeability, as assessed by the extravasation of intravenously injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. nC5a induced a dose-dependent increase in vasopermeability, whereas alterations induced by rC5a plateaued at 50 ng. The C5a-induced vasopermeability was markedly enhanced in animals that had been previously treated with an inhibitor of serum carboxypeptidase, which converts C5a to the less potent derivative, C5a des Arg. These findings suggest that carboxypeptidase plays an important role in vivo in the modulation of C5a-induced cutaneous inflammation in murine skin. 
Elevated intravesical pressure causes arterial hypoperfusion in canine colocystoplasty: a fluorometric assessment. Since 1988 there have been 15 reported cases of late, spontaneously ruptured intestinal cystoplasties at bowel sites remote from the anastomosis. Ischemic necrosis has been suggested as a possible etiology. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying the uptake of intravascular fluorescein in the augmented bowel of adult mongrel canines. There was a statistically significant decrease in fluorescein uptake at high intravesical pressures, which appeared to be most pronounced at the antimesenteric border. This laboratory study supports a recent clinical report of histological changes pathognomonic for chronic ischemia in the augmented bowel of patients with spontaneous rupture. 
Predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for patency of the infarct-related coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy. In animal studies reperfusion of coronary arteries is commonly accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias. It is not certain, however, whether ventricular arrhythmias can be used as a reliable non-invasive marker of reperfusion in humans. Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2.8 (2.7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37%) of the 57 patients: accelerated idioventricular rhythm in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92%) of the 13 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% confidence interval 66 to 99%), in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients without accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% CI 34 to 66%), in 11 (73%) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95% CI 45 to 92%), and in 23 (55%) (95% CI 39 to 71%) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen (81%) of the 21 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, had a patent infarct-related vessel (95% CI 58 to 94%) as did 17 (47%) of the 36 patients with no ventricular arrhythmia (95% CI 29 to 65%). In patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm after thrombolysis the infarct-related vessel is almost certain to be patent; but the infarct-related coronary artery can still be patent when no arrhythmia is seen. 
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast: mammographic appearance and histologic correlation. The mammograms and histologic slides of 58 cases of atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast were retrospectively reviewed to determine the geographic correlation (direct, near, or remote) between mammographic abnormalities (if present) and the histologic findings. A direct mammographic-histologic correlation was found in 24 of the 58 cases (41%), near correlation in 15 (26%), and remote correlation in 19 (33%). Clustered microcalcifications were the most common mammographic abnormality that was directly correlated with AH at histologic examination. Atypical ductal hyperplasia was much more frequently associated with a direct mammographic-histologic correlation than was atypical lobular hyperplasia (48% vs 9%). The authors conclude that, although no pathognomonic appearance of AH was discovered, mammographic abnormalities similar to those of small cancers could be directly correlated with histologic findings in 41% of cases. Since AH has been shown to be associated with a five- to tenfold increased risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma, frequent clinical and at least yearly mammographic follow-up is suggested once AH is discovered. 
A randomized study of closure of the peritoneum at cesarean delivery. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during low transverse cervical cesarean delivery is not associated with increased intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. One hundred thirteen patients scheduled for low transverse cervical cesarean were randomized to either closure of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum with absorbable suture (N = 59) or no peritoneal closure (N = 54). Patients were cared for in the usual postoperative manner without reference to treatment group. There were no demographic differences between the groups and no differences in method(s) of anesthesia, operative indication(s), or use of peripartum epidural narcotics. The incidence of fever, endometritis, or wound infection was similar between groups. There were no differences in the number of patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesia or in the number of doses per patient. The number of oral analgesic doses was significantly greater with closure than without (P = .014). The frequency with which postoperative ileus was diagnosed in each group was similar, and there was no difference regarding the day on which patients were advanced to liquid or select diets. Bowel stimulants were administered more frequently to the closure than to non-closure patients (P = .03). The average operating time was shorter for the open group than for the closure group (P less than .005). We conclude that non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum at low transverse cervical cesarean delivery appears to have no adverse effect on immediate postoperative recovery, may decrease postoperative narcotic requirements, allows less complicated return of bowel function, and provides a simplified and shorter surgical procedure. 
Experience with the first 250 endometrial resections for menorrhagia [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 Jan 1;337(8753):1362] 234 patients with menorrhagia were treated hysteroscopically by transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) instead of hysterectomy. 250 procedures were performed under general anaesthesia (63%) or under sedation plus local anaesthesia (38%). The endometrium was excised either totally (91%) or partially (9%) in all but one case, and 56 (22%) of the patients underwent simultaneous resection of submucous fibroids. Surgical time (range 10-100 min) varied with the gynaecologist's experience. 479 ml was the average volume of uterine irrigant absorbed by the patient. Blood loss was usually slight. Operative complications were uncommon, but 4 (2%) women sustained a uterine perforation (without serious sequelae), 7 (3%) absorbed more than 2 litres of fluid, and 1 required tamponade to control postoperative bleeding. Hospital stay was short and full recovery usual by 1-2 weeks. Menstrual symptoms improved in over 90% of the patients throughout the follow-up of up to 2 1/2 years; 27-42% of the women became amenorrhoeic at some time after total TCRE. Results were best in women greater than 35 years of age, but was not influenced by the presence of fibroids or pretreatment dysmenorrhoea. 10 (4%) women later underwent hysterectomy. Hysteroscopy 3 and 12 months after surgery revealed a small, fibrotic uterine cavity in the majority. 
Pathologic fibrosis and matrix connective tissue in the subaortic myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To evaluate scar-type and matrix connective tissue and to assess their role in the diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, surgically resected subaortic myectomy specimens and several autopsy hearts from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. Eighteen specimens were differentially stained by a newly developed method that precisely determines relative collagen content; these tissues were compared with postmortem hypertrophied and normal control subaortic specimens. Quantitation revealed a 72% higher level (36.5 vs. 22.1 micrograms collagen/mg protein) of stainable collagen in the hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in hypertrophied control hearts. The endocardial plaque was quantitated morphometrically, and it constituted only 4.6 +/- 1.7% of the total increased collagen content in the cardiomyopathy specimens. For the matrix studies, the cardiomyopathy specimens were stained by a silver impregnation technique that identifies connective tissue elements not normally visible with routine histologic methods. There was a marked increase in content of all matrix components, both in areas of pathologic scarring and in "normal" zones. Whorls of matrix connective tissue were noted in regions of myocyte whorls, as well as independent of them. Thus, these studies revealed a striking increase of both scar-type and matrix connective tissue in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The extensive scarring and the pronounced interstitial and intercellular matrix connective tissue may contribute to the increased ventricular chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation in this disease. 
Erythropoietin concentrations in obstructive sleep apnoea. Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and a normal haemoglobin concentration underwent nocturnal studies during which oxyhaemoglobin saturation was recorded continuously with an ear oximeter and serum erythropoietin concentration was measured hourly by means of a radioimmunoassay. Serum erythropoietin concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the study despite falls in oxyhaemaglobin saturation in individuals to 33-78%. There was no relation between the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia and serum erythropoietin concentrations. The brief cyclical episodes of hypoxaemia typical of obstructive sleep apnoea may not be a sufficient stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. 
Growth of tracheal anastomoses: advantage of absorbable interrupted sutures [published erratum appears in Ann Thorac Surg 1991 Jul;52(1):176] Growth of the trachea after complete transection and anastomosis was studied in four groups of 1-month-old New Zealand white rabbits. The trachea was transected at the fifth cartilaginous ring and then anastomosed with continuous 6-0 polypropylene (Prolene) (group 1), interrupted 6-0 polypropylene (group 2), continuous 6-0 polydioxanone (PDS) (group 3), or interrupted 6-0 PDS (group 4). The animals were followed up for 90 to 103 days (mean follow-up, 95 days). At the time the animals were killed, body weight had increased 125% (1.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.18 kg). Growth of the trachea was assessed at the time of death. Results from this study suggest that growth of a tracheal anastomosis is retarded in a growing animal model. The degree of resultant stenosis was significantly less when an absorbable suture material (PDS) and an interrupted suturing technique were used. 
Impedance plethysmography: a new method for continuous muscle perfusion monitoring. Vigilant postoperative monitoring of the buried muscle flap is critical after free transfer because early diagnosis of vascular insufficiency is essential to allow prompt correction. We have identified a monitoring method utilizing needle electrodes and impedance plethysmography that gives a beat-to-beat representation of muscular perfusion. In 25 New Zealand White rabbits the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated on its vascular pedicle, and two intramuscular needle electrodes were placed. The instantaneous impedance changes of the muscle (corresponding to the pulsatile volume changes of perfusion) were measured and recorded. Using this representation of perfusion, an independent judge was able to correctly diagnose muscular ischemia 100 percent of the time (n = 25). Further, the judge was able to correctly distinguish the ischemia as arterial (n = 10) or venous (n = 10) in origin 100 percent of the time. Additionally, we monitored muscle perfusion transcutaneously in five free muscle flaps and demonstrated a reliable impedance signal that correlated with perfusion. 
Sclerosing vasculopathy of the central nervous system in nonelderly demented patients. Three nonelderly patients without hypertension whose clinical and radiologic features otherwise resembled Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy underwent biopsy of the hyperintense periventricular lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The pathologic findings of the periventricular lesions consisted of gliosis with mild rarefaction and edema of the white matter. All patients had a sclerosing vasculopathy of unknown cause, which involved numerous small vessels within the periventricular lesions. The vessels stained negatively for amyloid, amyloid precursors, desmin, vimentin, keratin, immunoglobulin, and complement. On electron microscopy, small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries were characterized by swollen astrocytic foot processes surrounding the vessels; dense, perivascular collagen packing; crystalline arrays of filaments within basement membrane; giant lipid-laden lysosomes within perivascular cells; and narrowing of the vascular lumina. Similar changes were not seen in a control group of 19 patients. The pathologic features of the vessels in these cases are distinct from the vasculopathy associated with Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. We suggest that a spectrum of vasculopathies may be associated with dementia and periventricular hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Invasive treatment of pancreatic fluid collections with surgical and nonsurgical methods. Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) can be drained surgically or nonsurgically with endoscopic or radiologic techniques. To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available. Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded. Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures. A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients. Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients. Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12). Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%. The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics. Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery. Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients. 
Seromuscular enterocystoplasty in rats. Enterocystoplasty is commonly used in clinical practice. Many of its undesirable effects, that is infections, stones, mucus production, absorption of urinary components into the blood stream and risk of cancer, result from the intestinal mucosa lining the urinary tract. We report on the feasibility of creating an enterocytoplasty with a seromuscular colonic segment that acquires a transitional epithelial lining. Augmentation enterocystoplasty was performed in 51 male, 500 gm., Sprague-Dawley rats with a 1.82 cm.2 patch of left colon from which the mucosa had been stripped. The serosal surface was used as lining for the enterocystoplasty. The intestinal patch and the bladder capacity at known pressure were measured at operation and at sacrifice. The histology of the enterocystoplasty was studied in detail following sacrifice. Of the animals 40 survived without significant complications and were sacrificed at a mean postoperative time of 30 days (range 5 to 80 days). In the remaining 11 rats a bladder stone developed but it did not seem to affect the outcome of the experiment. The size of the patch could be measured in 22 rats: it was 1.82 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 0.86) at operation and 2.30 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 1.1) at sacrifice. In none of the rats did the patch decrease in size. The bladder capacity at a known pressure (mean 17 cm. water) could be measured in 26 animals: it was 2.35 ml. (standard deviation +/- 0.65) at operation and 5.18 ml. (standard deviation +/- 1.19) at sacrifice. Histological analysis was done in 40 rats. In all cases the serosal surface was lined with transitional epithelium, there was no fibrosis or inflammation and the structure of the muscular layer of the bowel remained intact. The earliest growth of uroepithelium in the serosal surface of the bowel was noted at 5 days. This model suggests that the seromuscular enterocystoplasty can be constructed successfully in the rat model. The seromuscular intestinal patch does not shrink. The bladder capacity increases and histology shows a uroepithelial lining of the augmentation. 
Obesity: types and treatments. Causes of obesity include a low resting metabolic rate, environmental factors, family behavior patterns, a poorly developed satiety response and reactive eating due to stress or anxiety. Morbid obesity is characterized by an increased number of adipocytes and a degree of irreversibility. Overeating increases the size of adipocytes; however, once adipocytes achieve their maximal size, proliferation is induced and massive, irreversible obesity may result. A syndrome of restrained eating produced by chronic dieting leads to hunger, frustration and rebound overeating. Treatment may be unsuccessful because of the failure to address specific causes of obesity in individual patients and the use of reducing regimens that are not designed to maintain weight loss. Recognition of the diverse clinical forms of obesity and their different etiologies permits treatment regimens to be more specific, increasing the likelihood of success. Even with this approach, treatment failure is common. 
Transmembrane domain length variation in the evolution of major histocompatibility complex class I genes. The fifth exons of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes encode a transmembrane domain (TM) that is largely responsible for class I antigen cell-surface expression usually through conventional hydrophobic amino acid-membrane interactions or, less often, through phosphatidylinositol linkage. In this report we show that Peromyscus leucopus, a Cricetidae rodent, has MHC class I genes (Pele-A genes) encoding three distinct sizes of TMs. Increases in TM lengths were due to tandem duplications of sequences similar to human hypervariable minisatellite repeats and the lambda chi site. We discerned remnants of a similar duplication event in comparable rodent and primate MHC class I genes. Furthermore, several duplications and deletions appear to have occurred independently in H-2, RT1, Pele-A, and ChLA genes in near-identical positions. Accumulated data suggests that sequences in the fifth exon of MHC class I genes may, therefore, constitute a mutational or recombinational hot spot that is mediated by minisatellite- and chi-like sequences imbedded within the coding region. The MHC class I genes may thus have recruited "selfish" DNA in their evolution to encode cell surface proteins. Expression of Pele-A genes was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers specific for exon 4 and 5 sequences. The PCR product sizes indicated that genes encoding each TM domain length are ubiquitously transcribed. 
The use of FDG-PET in the detection and management of malignant lymphoma: correlation of uptake with prognosis. Twenty-one patients with untreated malignant lymphoma in the head and neck region were evaluated with positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and gallium-67 SPECT imaging. Tumor-to-normal soft-tissue contrast ratios (TCRs) obtained 60 min after injection of FDG were higher than 2.6, and all malignant lymphomas were clearly visualized. In patients with poor prognosis, higher TCRs and glucose utilization rates (GURs) were observed, whereas low TCR and GUR were shown in a patient with low-grade malignancy. In comparison with 67Ga scintigraphy, patients with high TCRs and GURs were likely to show increased accumulation of gallium-67, but accumulation of gallium-67 was not increased as much as FDG in poor prognostic patients. FDG-PET may be useful in the detection and management of malignant lymphoma. 
Campylobacter enteritis--New Zealand, 1990. In August-September 1990, an outbreak of Campylobacter enteritis occurred at a camp near Christchurch, New Zealand. This report provides a preliminary summary of the investigation of this outbreak by the New Zealand Communicable Disease Centre and the Canterbury Area Health Board. 
Usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of conditions mimicking aortic dissection. Between September 1987 and April 1989, forty patients suspected to have aortic dissection were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography. Aortic dissection was identified in 18 patients. This study evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of the 22 patients in whom aortic dissection was not found. A range of pathologic conditions was diagnosed in these patients. Five patients had ischemic heart disease when they were initially seen. Among the remaining 17 only one patient had a normal aorta. Aortic disease was present in the other 16 patients with aortic dilatation in 10. Atheromas were detected in seven patients with concomitant aortic dilatation in five of them. An extrinsic aortic mass was present in two patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified an anastomotic leak at the site of left coronary artery implantation in a patient with a recent Bentall procedure, and a large mobile clot within the proximal descending aorta in a patient with blunt chest trauma. These findings obviated the need for other tests in 15 patients and led to surgery in four with no ancillary tests performed in three of them. Thus transesophageal echocardiography has an important role in assessing patients with suspected dissection. Aortic disease is common even in patients in whom aortic dissection is excluded, and some of the conditions can be just as life-threatening as dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography not only reliably identifies dissection but can also detect luminal and extraluminal diseases not adequately visualized by other modalities. 
Dispersion of refractoriness in canine ventricular myocardium. Effects of sympathetic stimulation. In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31%) or right-sided stimulation only (14%). In 13% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart. 
Depressed contractile function due to canine mitral regurgitation improves after correction of the volume overload [published erratum appears in J Clin Invest 1991 Aug;88(2):723] It is known that long-standing volume overload on the left ventricle due to mitral regurgitation eventually leads to contractile dysfunction. However, it is unknown whether or not correction of the volume overload can lead to recovery of contractility. In this study we tested the hypothesis that depressed contractile function due to volume overload in mitral regurgitation could return toward normal after mitral valve replacement. Using a canine model of mitral regurgitation which is known to produce contractile dysfunction, we examined contractile function longitudinally in seven dogs at baseline, after 3 mo of mitral regurgitation, 1 mo after mitral valve replacement, and 3 mo after mitral valve replacement. After 3 mo of mitral regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 0.62 +/- 0.04), end-diastolic volume had nearly doubled from 68 +/- 6.8 to 123 +/- 12.1 ml (P less than 0.05). All five indices of contractile function which we examined were depressed. For instance, maximum fiber elastance (EmaxF) obtained by assessment of time-varying elastance decreased from 5.95 +/- 0.71 to 2.25 +/- 0.18 (P less than 0.05). The end-systolic stiffness constant (k) was also depressed from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.3. 3 mo after mitral valve replacement all indexes of contractile function had returned to or toward normal (e.g., EmaxF 3.65 +/- 0.21 and k 4.2 +/- 0.3). We conclude that previously depressed contractile function due to volume overload can improve after correction of the overload. 
Septic shock. Septic shock (SS) is the most common type of shock encountered by internists, and its prevalence appears to be increasing. SS complicates all types of infections. The hemodynamic characteristics of SS include a low systemic vascular resistance and an elevated, but relatively inadequate, cardiac output. A cardiomyopathy frequently occurs. The major endogenous mediator of SS is tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins-1 and -2 may also contribute. Important secondary phenomena include release of platelet activating factor, vasodilator prostaglandins, and upregulation of adhesion molecules on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells. Current therapy is often ineffectual, and potentially promising new therapeutic approaches are reviewed. 
Clinical indications for cervical spine radiographs in alert trauma patients. Cervical spine fracture/dislocation is a potentially devastating injury that may be clinically difficult to diagnose. Therefore, a vast majority of trauma patients undergo cervical spine X rays when only a relatively small number of them will actually have a cervical spine injury. Because of the costly overuse of radiography, studies have been undertaken to define high yield criteria for evaluation of patients. This study examined the characteristics of acute cervical spine fracture/dislocation in alert trauma patients. Of 79 patients with this discharge diagnosis at St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center between 1982 and 1987, 47 met the criteria of Class I level of consciousness. All 47 patients complained of neck pain or demonstrated cervical tenderness to palpation. Other parameters (such as loss of consciousness, paresthesias, decreased sensation, weakness, cervical muscle spasm, decreased anal tone, and associated injuries) did not, individually or in combination with each other, consistently predict cervical spine injury. Although occult or painless cervical spine injuries have been reported in the literature, a careful review of these cases revealed that these injuries were not truly asymptomatic. Our study suggests that selected patients can be excluded from radiologic evaluation of the cervical spine. However, large prospective studies are needed to validate this finding. 
Pacemaker failure on induction of anaesthesia. A patient with a permanent pacemaker presented for repair of a strangulated hernia. During induction of anaesthesia, the pacemaker generator stopped discharging, thus causing cardiac arrest. The likely cause of the generator failure was inhibition by suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations. Following defibrillation, and increase in stimulation threshold necessitated urgent insertion of a transvenous pacing system. It is suggested that, when suxamethonium is to be used in a patient with a permanent pacemaker, consideration should be given to reprogramming the pacemaker to asynchronous mode before induction of anaesthesia. If a patient with a pacemaker requires defibrillation, an acute increase in stimulation threshold may result and cause loss of capture. Rapid insertion of a transvenous pacing system may be necessary. 
Shock wave-induced pancreatic trauma. A case is described of the appearance of a pancreatic or peripancreatic lesion after left renal calculus fragmentation by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Its anatomical location and subsequent disappearance suggest it was related to trauma caused by the shock waves. The brief literature on pancreatic injury after ESWL is reviewed, and the role of the patient's underlying liver disease in the genesis of this complication is discussed. 
Different types of skew deviation. Although all manifest skew deviations appear the same for the clinician, skew deviation can result from different combinations of dysconjugate vertical ocular deviations. Evidence is presented for three different types of skew deviation when it occurs as a feature of an ocular tilt reaction. In type 1 (utricle) there is upward deviation of both eyes with different amplitudes, as described for otolith Tullio phenomenon in humans. In Type 2 (dorsolateral medulla oblongata) hypertropia of one eye occurs while the other eye remains in the primary position, the hypothetical mechanism of skew deviation in Wallenberg's syndrome. In Type 3 (midbrain tegmentum) there is simultaneous hypertropia of one eye and hypotropia of the other eye, as described for electrical stimulation of midbrain tegmentum in monkeys and observed in clinical cases with a paroxysmal ocular tilt reaction. 
Effect of P6 acupressure on postoperative vomiting in children undergoing outpatient strabismus correction. A prospective, double-blind study was conducted to compare the effect of pressure at the P6 (Neikuan) point with placebo as an antiemetic in children. Sixty-six patients, ages 3-12 yr, undergoing outpatient surgery for correction of strabismus, were allocated randomly to receive either bilateral P6 acupressure or placebo during the perioperative period. The study was designed to detect a 50% difference in the incidence of postoperative vomiting between the two groups, with a 90% power of achieving a statistically significant result at the 5% level (two-tailed). The incidence of postoperative vomiting for the placebo group was 58% before discharge from hospital, 73% at home and 82% in the first 24 h after surgery. The corresponding results for the acupressure group were 58% before discharge, 71% at home and 94% in the first 24 h. These differences were not significant; P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery. 
Prognosis for recovery from prolonged posttraumatic unawareness: logistic analysis. This study reviews the course and outcome of 130 patients who remained in a state of prolonged unawareness 30 days after severe cranio-cerebral trauma. Prognostic indicators and outcome were fitted by a logistic model. The significant prognostic factors observable in the first week after trauma were found to be ventilatory status, motor reactivity and significant extraneural trauma. The significant prognostic factors after the first month of unawareness were early ventilatory status, early motor reactivity, late epilepsy and hydrocephalus. The estimated probability of recovery of awareness (that is, consciousness) ranged from 0.94 in patients with early decorticate posturing in the absence of both extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance to 0.06 in patients with flaccidity, extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance in the first week after injury. 
Coronary artery thrombolysis: comparison of approved agents. Three agents approved for the lysis of thrombi in coronary arteries--alteplase, anistreplase and streptokinase--have undergone critical clinical experimental trials in Europe and the United States. Global comparison of their efficacy shows that alteplase is slightly more effective (71 percent) in restoring patency than anistreplase (60 percent) and streptokinase (58 percent). Streptokinase and anistreplase are allergenic, and repeat administration is not feasible in the short-term, a distinct advantage for alteplase. More accurate dosing of thrombolytic agents and skillful use of aspirin and heparin improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy but can also increase the risk of bleeding. A recanalization rate of 90 percent or more could be achieved if the thrombolytic agent is administered within the first hour after thrombosis. Administration this soon after the development of thrombosis may be possible if the agent is given outside the hospital by practicing physicians or, perhaps, paramedics. 
Preoperative prediction of pathological tumor volume and stage in clinically localized prostate cancer: comparison of digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Accurate preoperative staging is important for proper selection of patients for radical retropubic prostatectomy. Preoperative staging by digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Gleason grade and prostate specific antigen was compared to pathological stage for 25 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. The predictive value for tumor confinement was 36% by rectal examination, 37% by ultrasound and 30% by MRI. The predictive value for extracapsular disease was 100% by rectal examination, 83% by ultrasound and 66% by MRI. Preoperative determinations of tumor volume by any modality did not correlate with pathological tumor volume. Digital rectal examination, ultrasound and MRI clinically understage the disease in most patients but they may be reliable to predict extracapsular disease. 
Sublaminar fixation in lumbosacral fusions. Sublaminar fixation to stainless steel rectangles was employed in an effort to improve the fusion rate in lumbar and lumbosacral arthrodesis. Thirty-seven patients had spondylolisthesis, and 26 had other causes of pain secondary to lumbar mechanical instability. Of the 63 patients, 53 achieved fusion and 52 had relief of pain. No infections or neurologic complications were encountered. This fusion rate of 84% does not significantly differ from rates obtained with noninstrumented methods, and this construct is no longer used for lumbar fusions. 
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Kearns-Sayre syndrome: mitochondrial DNA mutations. Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) supplies extranuclear (cytoplasmic) genes which program the manufacture of 13 of the 67 peptides of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The remaining 54 are coded by nuclear DNA. All human children and adults, male and female, are entirely dependent on the cytoplasm of the ovum for their complement of mt DNA; the sperm contributes none. Accordingly, mutations in the mt DNA in a mother's ova will be passed on to all her children, although not all are clinically affected. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is in most cases due to a mutation that leads to the replacement of guanine by adenine at position 11778 in mt DNA. This causes histidine to be inserted instead of the normal arginine at the site of the 340th amino acid in the respiratory enzyme NADH subunit 4, hence its defective function. Other point mutations in the mt DNA coding for polypeptides of the respiratory chain complex or controlling sequences coded by mt DNA have been found in other families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA is the site of other mutations as well. For ophthalmologists, the most important of these is the rare Kearns-Sayre syndrome (pigmentary retinopathy plus muscular dystrophies, especially of the extraocular muscles). Kearns-Sayre syndrome is due to deletions in the mt DNA, which vary in size and so affect a number of different respiratory enzymes, hence the variable manifestations. Cases are usually sporadic because the disease is often so severe that affected individuals do not reproduce if they survive, but in some cases inheritance from the mother has been reported. 
Treatment of uterine leiomyomata with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist: the possibility of nonsurgical management in selected perimenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LH-RH-a) in the treatment of leiomyomata. DESIGN: A retrospective randomized trial. SETTING: Hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology. PATIENTS: Twenty-five women, ages 36 to 54 years with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata, were divided into two groups according to the responsiveness to LH-RH-a: group A patients reached menopause after LH-RH-a, whereas resumption of menstruation occurred within 12 weeks after cessation of therapy in group B. INTERVENTIONS: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was administered intranasally three times a day with 150 micrograms insufflation of one spray in each nostril (total dose: 900 micrograms/d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacies of treatment were assessed in terms of uterine volume, hemoglobin concentrations, serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and bone density during and after treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly after 16 weeks of treatment. A significant reduction in uterine volume was observed in both groups. After completing therapy, there was no further significant change in uterine volume in group A, whereas uterine volume in group B returned to pretreatment values. Serum LH and FSH concentrations were suppressed during treatment, but those gonadotropins in group A increased significantly up to the menopausal levels after treatment. Serum E2 concentrations in both groups showed consistent suppression by the end of the first treatment cycle. After cessation of therapy, serum E2 levels on group A remained in the castrate range, whereas E2 in group B returned to pretreatment levels, concomitant with the return of normal ovulation. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal administration of LH-RH-a was successful in significantly decreasing uterine volume and increasing hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women with leiomyomata. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
Patterns of epithelial migration in the unaffected ear in patients with a history of unilateral cholesteatoma. Epithelial migration in a centrifugal manner is an established phenomenon in the normal human tympanic membrane. This pattern of migration is symmetrical in both ears of any one individual. We present a prospective study on the pattern of tympanic ink dot migration on the normal drum, in patients with a history of cholesteatoma in one ear. It was demonstrated that patients who develop cholesteatoma have a normal migratory pattern and rate in the unaffected ear. The conclusion from this study is that defective migration is not the initiating factor in the development of acquired cholesteatoma. 
The use of CT scanning to triage patients requiring admission following minimal head injury. Recent data have suggested that patients with both a normal cranial CT scan and normal neurologic examination following minimal head injury (MHI) have no risk of neurologic deterioration. This study prospectively examined the safety of discharging patients from the emergency department (ED) after MHI whether or not there was a responsible observer at home. MHI was defined as a history of loss of consciousness (LOC), a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14 or 15, and no focal neurologic findings. In a 4-month period 111 patients with MHI were evaluated. Fifteen (14%) patients had a CT scan which revealed an intracerebral injury; 96 patients had a normal CT scan; five patients with normal CT scans were admitted because of persistent lethargy; and one patient was admitted after his CT that demonstrated an old infarct; the remaining 90 patients were discharged. There were 71 men and 19 women with a mean age of 29 years. The mechanism of injury was assault in 55, MVA in 30, and falls in five. The initial GCS in was 15 in 79 and 14 in 11. Fifty-eight per cent of patients were intoxicated. Fifty-seven (63%) patients were successfully contacted by telephone; none had developed any neurologic symptoms. Thirty-one patients who could not be followed up gave fictitious phone numbers. These data suggest that CT can reliably triage patients who can be discharged from the ED following MHI, even in the absence of a responsible observer. Hospital admission can be avoided in more than 80% of patients sustaining MHI, better utilizing scarce hospital resources. 
Collateral circulation as a marker of the presence of viable myocardium in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The relationship between the presence of viable myocardium and the extent of coronary collateral circulation to the infarct area was evaluated in 20 patients with a recent anterior myocardial infarction who had complete obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The viability of myocardial tissue was assessed by exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy, and the collateral circulation was angiographically evaluated by means of a collateral index ranging from 0 to 3. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (group 1, n = 10) or absence (group 2, n = 10) of viable myocardium in the perfusion territory of the infarct-related artery. The collateral index in group 1 was 2.5 +/- 0.5 (SD), which was significantly higher than the 0.7 +/- 0.8 in group 2. These findings indicate that the presence of ischemic but viable myocardium is intimately related to the development of collateral circulation in patients with myocardial infarction, and the existence of well-developed collateral channels predicts the presence of viable myocardium in the infarct area. 
Patient dose and associated risk due to radiological investigation of the internal auditory meatus. The radiation doses and associated somatic risks due to four radiological examinations for acoustic neuromata (AN) have been investigated. These examinations were (1) plain film radiography of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), (2) computed tomography (CT) of the IAM, (3) CT of the posterior fossa and (4) CT of the IAM with air contrast. Organ dose measurements were performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosemeters loaded in a patient equivalent phantom. Dose equivalents to various organs are presented, together with the effective dose equivalent and collective effective dose equivalent for each examination. Hypothetical fatal somatic risks for each examination studied here have been estimated from the effective dose equivalents. The estimated number of hypothetical fatal cancers induced by radiological examinations for AN is between approximately 110 and 820 times lower than the number of detected AN, depending on the method of assessing the radiation dose to the remainder organs. It is concluded that in this particular study the radiological examinations are of net benefit to this group of patients. 
Hydatidiform mole and fetus with normal karyotype: support of a separate entity. Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies. The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels. Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi. In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception. With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception. In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely. Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole. Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis. 
Phenothiazine-associated apnea in two siblings. A two-month-old white girl presented to our facility with increasing lethargy and new onset apnea and bradycardia following a week of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. The patient had been receiving a cough syrup containing promethazine hydrochloride during the previous five days, which was temporally correlated with the onset of lethargy and apneic episodes. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient's older sibling also may have experienced phenothiazine-associated apnea after receiving a combination of meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, and chlorpromazine as a premedication prior to an endoscopic examination. In addition to the presentation of these cases, the literature pertaining to phenothiazine-associated apnea is reviewed. 
Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement: a miniaturized infrared qualitative CO2 detector. STUDY OBJECTIVES: A miniaturized, infrared, solid-state, end-tidal CO2 detector was used to confirm emergency endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. DESIGN: This prospective, clinical study used a miniature, infrared, solid-state end-tidal CO2 detector to confirm ETT placement in an acute setting. SETTING: The ICU, emergency department, and hospital floor. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: There were 88 consecutive adult patients requiring 100 emergency intubations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The indication for airway intervention was considered urgent in 79% and under arrest conditions in 21%. The mean number of intubation attempts was 1.83 (range, one to five) with difficulty of intubation of 6.48 and confirmation of 7.75, on a linear scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Determination of ETT position revealed intratracheal intubation in 96% and esophageal intubation in 4%. Placement was confirmed by direct visualization or radiography in all cases. Sensitivity and specificity for ETT localization was 100% (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: This hand-held infrared capnometer reliably confirms ETT placement under emergency conditions. 
Lateral rhachotomy for thoracic spinal lesions. Capener's "Lateral Rhachotomy" was modified by additional excision of the pedicle, articular facets, part of the lamina, and a posterior half of the vertebral bodies on one side through a transpleural approach to the thoracic spine, and a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine. The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely. This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass. The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura. In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion. Using "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy," it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision. In the present report, the authors described their "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy" procedure, and reviewed the case material. 
Factor XIII subunits in relation to some other hemostatic parameters in ulcerative colitis. The hemostatic parameters, particularly with respect to F.XIII subunits, were examined in 48 untreated UC patients (22 at active and 26 at quiescent stage). UC active patients showed a significant decrease of F.XIII subunit "a," compared with healthy subjects, as well as in UC patients in remission. In contrast, the level of F.XIII subunit "b" in each group was similar. Compared with normal subjects, UC active patients revealed a significant decrease in AT III concentration, prolonged ELT, and elevated fibrinogen level. In addition, the elevated titer of SDPS test for SFMC appeared in approximately 40% of those patients. However, no strict relationship was found between the presence of positive SDPS and diminution of AT III, as well as of F.XIIII subunit "a" in active UC state. In patients in remission, AT III level and ELT were similar to those as in the control group, but fibrinogen concentration was elevated. Such constellation of hemostatic parameters may indicate a tendency to blood hypercoagulability in UC active patients, whereas, in general, these changes are not associated with the stage of remission. The present data may also suggest that F.XIII behavior pattern should be taken into account in the clinical management of UC. 
The prevalence of carcinoma in palpable vs impalpable, mammographically detected lesions. Concern over excessive numbers of false-positive mammograms, leading to unnecessary investigations and surgical interventions, has been cited as a barrier to mammographic screening for breast cancer. We compared the biopsy results from palpable vs impalpable, mammographically detected lesions from one experienced breast surgeon's practice from July 1980 through July 1989. Overall, there were 372 biopsies in 346 women. Of 143 biopsies for palpable abnormalities, 48 (34%) yielded a primary malignant lesion. The length of the palpable cancers averaged 3.7 cm (median, 2.8 cm). Sixteen (33%) of the 48 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary lymph nodes, and five (10%) were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. Of 229 biopsies for impalpable, mammographically detected lesions, 72 (31%) yielded a primary breast carcinoma. Excluding 34 carcinomas that had only calcifications, the length of the mammographically detected tumors averaged 2.0 cm (median, 1.5 cm). Eleven (15%) of the 72 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary nodes, and none were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. The positive predictive values (number of cancers detected divided by the number of biopsies recommended) were not significantly different when comparing biopsies indicated for palpable, clinically detected (34%) vs impalpable, mammographically detected (31%) abnormalities (p = .669). However, the mammographically detected cancers were smaller, more often noninvasive (32% vs 4%), less often associated with axillary metastases (15% vs 33%), and without distant metastases (0% vs 10%). 
The role of fiberoptic endoscopy in the management of corrosive ingestion and modified endoscopic classification of burns. We prospectively evaluated the role of fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the management of 81 patients with corrosive ingestion. A total of 381 endoscopic examinations were performed: 88 within 96 hours following corrosive ingestion, 108 between the third and ninth week, and 185 during the period of follow-up after bougie dilation of esophageal strictures. The customary endoscopic classification of burns (grades 0 to 3) was modified by subdividing grade 2 burns into 2a and 2b, and grade 3 burns into 3a and 3b for prognostic and therapeutic implications. There was no significant correlation between oropharyngeal and upper gastrointestinal tract injury. Early major complications and deaths were confined to patients with grade 3 burns. All patients with grade 0, 1, and 2a burns recovered without sequelae. The majority of patients (71.4%) with grade 2b injury and all survivors with grade 3 injury developed esophageal or gastric cicatrization, or both, which needed endoscopic or surgical treatment. There were no complications related to endoscopy. We conclude that early endoscopy is not only a safe, reliable, and accurate diagnostic tool in such patients, but also is of crucial importance in management and prognosis. 
The effect of corneal hypesthesia on the duration of proparacaine anesthetic eyedrops. The duration of action of proparacaine is known in the normal cornea but not in the hypesthetic cornea. To determine this, we examined both eyes in seven patients with documented unilateral corneal hypesthesia associated with inactive herpetic disease. Cochet-Bonnet measurements were made in both eyes before and at two- to five-minute intervals after the instillation of one drop of 0.5% proparacaine until baseline corneal sensitivity levels were again achieved. Mean recovery time was 34.86 minutes in eyes with normal corneal sensitivity, compared to 45.43 minutes in hypesthetic corneas. In all patients, the recovery time was remarkably longer in the hypesthetic eye than it was in the normal fellow eye. These data demonstrate the need to wait up to one hour after the instillation of proparacaine in eyes suspected of having corneal hypesthesia if corneal sensitivity is to be determined accurately. Additionally, the duration of action of topically instilled anesthetic may be a useful method of discovering subtle differences in corneal sensitivity. 
Absence of synergistic effects of CNS treatments on neuropsychologic test performance among children. Three hypotheses are proposed to account for neurobehavioral impairments following treatment with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy: CNS treatments exert a synergistic effect (A x B), an additive effect (A + B), or a single-agent effect (A or B). Eighty-five long-term survivors of non-CNS cancers aged 6 to 16 years were classified into groups on the basis of CNS treatments: CRT-IT (n = 25), CRT-No IT (n = 11), No CRT-IT (n = 24), and No CRT-No IT (n = 25). Study I findings did not provide support for synergistic mechanisms; nonorthogonal analysis of variance showed interaction effects (CRT x IT) restricted to tactile-perceptual speed. However, main effects were significant for a single agent (CRT) across a wide range of measures. General intelligence, academic achievement, verbal knowledge and reasoning, and perceptual-motor abilities were found to be significantly lower among CRT-treated groups. Study II findings provided additional support for the role of CRT; Pearson correlations within the CRT-No IT group indicated significant negative associations between CRT dose estimates for cortical regions and perceptual-motor abilities. 
Renal vascular lesions as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with lupus nephritis. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Nefrite Lupica (GISNEL). The frequency of renal vascular lesions (RVL) and their relevance in the progression of renal damage were evaluated by the Pathology Group of the "Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Nefrite Lupica" (GISNEL). Of 285 patients with lupus nephritis collected from 20 nephrology centers in Italy and classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 79 cases (27.7%) with RVL were identified and classified as follows: (1) lupus vasculopathy (n = 27); (2) hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP) malignant hypertension-like lesions (n = 24); (3) vasculitis (n = 8); (4) arterio-arteriosclerosis (n = 20). At the time of renal biopsy, patients with RVL had mean serum creatinine levels significantly higher than patients without RVL (201.8 +/- 195.9 mumol/L [2.2 +/- 2.2 mg/dL] v 108.1 +/- 108.0 mumol/L [1.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dL]; P less than 0.01). Hypertension was more frequent in patients with RVL than in those without (68.4% v 30.5%; P less than 0.01). The probability of kidney survival assessed according to the Kaplan-Meier method at 5 and 10 years was, respectively, 74.3% +/- 5.9% and 58.0% +/- 8.9% in patients with RVL, compared with 89.6% +/- 2.7% and 85.9% +/- 3.7% in patients without RVL. However, the two groups did not differ significantly as regards overall survival, the probability of survival at 5 and 10 years being 86.5% +/- 4.5% and 78.8% +/- 6.6% in patients with RVL and 92.2% +/- 2.2% and 83.3% +/- 4.4% in patients without RVL. 
Perfusion imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi for the assessment of myocardial area at risk and the efficacy of acute treatment in myocardial infarction. There is a clear need to develop better measurement tools for assessment of the effect of acute therapy in myocardial infarction. Such tools must permit accurate measurement of the amount of myocardium that is initially at risk. 99mTc-sestamibi is a new radiopharmaceutical with unique properties that are well suited to the measurement of myocardium at risk without any delay in acute therapy. Tomographic imaging with this agent has been shown to provide accurate quantitative estimates of the myocardium at risk, which varies widely, even for patients with a similar coronary occlusion. For example, there is more than a threefold range in myocardium at risk for patients with a nonproximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The determination of the myocardium at risk before intervention and the change in this region after intervention constitute a promising measurement tool for the assessment of the effect of acute therapy. Initial studies with tomographic imaging have shown a significant improvement in a group of patients treated with thrombolysis, although the magnitude of improvement is highly variable in individual patients. Qualitatively similar results have been reported with planar imaging. Although it has a number of technical limitations, sequential imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi seems to have a clear advantage over those end points that have previously been used to assess acute therapy. This new measurement tool should facilitate future clinical trials of different treatments in acute myocardial infarction. 
Soft tissue sarcoma of the pleural cavity. Seventeen cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) developing in the pleural cavity were collected from Japanese hospitals, and their clinical and pathologic findings summarized. Eight of the 17 patients had a 15-year to 50-year (mean, 28.8) history of chronic pleural inflammatory disease (pleuritis, pyothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis) before the onset of the pleural sarcoma. Histologically, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common tumor type (11 cases), followed by angiosarcoma (four). The age at diagnosis of the sarcoma ranged from 15 to 74 years (mean, 58); the male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. In the eight cases of sarcoma associated with chronic pleural inflammatory disease, male preponderance was more marked (7:1). The commonest presenting symptom was chest pain. A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients. No patient had distant metastases at first admission. Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS. The actuarial 1-year survival rate was 38.5%. These findings suggest that long-standing pleural inflammation might be an etiologic factor for development of pleural STS. 
Endoscopic assessment of mucosal hemodynamic changes in a canine model of gastric ulcer. In studying the side effects of sclerosants injected into the gastric submucosa in dogs (N = 7), we noted that 3 ml of absolute ethanol induced a large gastric ulceration. We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer. 
Orbital lesions with granulomatous inflammation. Orbital lesions characterized by granulomatous inflammation are a heterogeneous group of diseases of various causes with a common histopathological substrate involving aggregates of epithelioid cells. Forty-one patients (27 females and 14 males) with biopsy-proven granulomatous inflammation were seen at an orbital clinic between 1978 and 1989. The mean age at presentation was 40.2 (extremes 6 and 77) years. Two main clinical presentations were noted: painless, subacute or chronic mass effect, and tender, subacute inflammatory process. Six patients had secondary features that were infiltrative in character. The lesions were primarily located in the anterior superior orbit. In nearly half the patients the granulomatous reaction was confined to the orbit (predominantly ruptured dermoid and localized orbital sarcoid), and the remainder had either regional involvement (Wegener's granulomatosis or fibro-osseous process) or systemic involvement (sarcoidosis). 
Felbamate: a clinical trial for complex partial seizures. We performed a randomized, double-blind, three-period cross-over study of felbamate (FBM, 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate: Carter-Wallace 554) in patients with complex partial seizures. Patients continued carbamazepine (CBZ) throughout the study and were observed in the hospital for the entire trial period. The entry criteria required at least six seizures in a 3-week baseline period (and no more than 1 week with a single seizure) with CBZ alone. Thirty subjects were randomized. Two left the study after randomization, 1 owing to seizure exacerbation, and 1 owing to hyponatremia, which may have been related to CBZ therapy. The daily dosage of 50 mg/kg (maximum 3,000 mg) FBM per day was well tolerated by all 28 patients who completed the study. Only mild adverse experience were observed during the trial. FBM reduced CBZ level (p less than 0.0001; 95% confidence interval -28%, -20%). There was no significant difference in seizure frequency between placebo and FBM periods (one-sided p = 0.172), but when a correction was made for the lower CBZ level noted during FBM periods, the data suggested a strong antiseizure effect of FBM. 
Cytokine-endothelial interactions in inflammation, immunity, and vascular injury. This paper reviews the evidence that cytokines induce a variety of functional and structural alterations in endothelium and that cytokine-endothelial interactions play important roles in the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. The effect of cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, on leukocyte-endothelial adhesion has led to the discovery of several endothelial adhesion molecules, and the molecular and biological characteristics of these are described. Finally, the review discusses the possible contribution of cytokine-induced activation to vascular injury in such pathological processes as septic shock, the Shwartzman reaction, delayed hypersensitivity, and immune-mediated vasculitis. 
Pontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia during burn resuscitation. Central pontine myelinolysis is a neurologic disease produced by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. This report describes the occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with burns. The natural history of this paralyzing condition and suggestions for its prevention are discussed. Severely burned and hyponatremic patients are at risk for this disorder because a large amount of sodium ion is typically required for the treatment of burn shock. Awareness of this phenomenon and avoidance of rapid correction of hyponatremia are essential to its prevention. 
Endoscopic palliation of tracheobronchial malignancies. The prognosis for tracheobronchial tumours remains poor. Most patients can be offered only palliation. When the main symptom is breathlessness or refractory haemoptysis from a large airway tumour endoscopic treatment may be very effective. Over the last decade most attention has focused on the neodymium YAG laser. This often produces dramatic effects but has some important limitations. In the last few years better techniques for stenting and intrabronchial radiotherapy (brachytherapy) have also been developed. This article discusses the range of techniques now available and aims to help clinicians decide which patients may benefit from referral to centres providing these techniques. 
Detection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in primary brain lymphoma without immunodeficiency. We searched for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) sequences by enzymatic DNA amplification in nine primary brain lymphomas from patients without immunodeficiency. We used seven nonlymphoma brain tumors as negative controls, and the Raji cell line as a positive control. We detected EBV DNA, using ethidium bromide-stained-agarose minigel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization, in the positive control and in only one brain lymphoma tumor; we did not detect EBV DNA in the other tumors. The EBV-positive patient had a second B-cell monoclonal population in the peripheral blood without detectable EBV DNA, suggesting a direct role for EBV in the development of the brain lymphoma. 
Treatment-seeking behavior among those with signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Significant delays in seeking definitive treatment for the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction increase morbidity and mortality. In most studies, delay times average more than 4 hours. The following variables are associated with increased delay: a medical history of angina, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; older age; black race; seeking advice from a family member or a physician; symptom onset on a weekday; and attempts at self-treatment. Variables associated with reduced delay times are the following: pain recognized as cardiac in origin, hemodynamic instability, severe chest pain, younger age, and consultation with a coworker. Surprisingly, patients who have already experienced a myocardial infarction are just as likely to delay as patients who have not had this experience. These findings provide direction for developing and testing patient and family interventions, establishing community education programs, and reducing patient delay in response to the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. 
Cardiac tumors and the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a multisystem disease with a wide range of initial symptoms that can be seen at any age. The most characteristic features are vertebral or rib anomalies, intracranial falx calcification, multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, and palmar and/or plantar pits. Pediatricians need to be aware that if any one of these major anomalies is seen, this diagnosis should be considered. There now appears to be an established association between cardiac tumors and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Primary cardiac tumors have been associated with cerebral tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, and evaluation of cardiac status is recommended when these genetically determined syndromes are diagnosed. This communication should serve to alert pediatricians to the need for complete cardiac evaluation and genetic counseling when a diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma is made. 
The surgical pathology of gastrointestinal Hodgkin's disease. The files of the National Cancer Institute were searched for all surgical specimens from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (HD) that were accessioned during the years 1953-1990; six patients with a histologically reconfirmed diagnosis were identified. Of these patients, four presented with GI HD and two had recurrent HD. Primary HD appeared in the stomach (three patients) and the duodenum (one patient); recurrent HD after diagnosis in a conventional nodal site appeared in the stomach (one patient) and the colon (one patient). One of the cases of primary gastric disease was a composite lymphoma consisting of HD and diffuse large cell lymphoma. In view of the rarity of GI tract involvement by HD, a diagnosis of primary GI HD should be viewed with skepticism; support for such a diagnosis may be provided by both classic histopathologic features of HD and immunostaining, but no single feature can be regarded as pathognomonic. 
Dislodgement of a vein graft thrombus by angiographic injection of native coronary artery. A case of retrograde dislodgement of thrombus in a saphenous vein graft during injection of the native right coronary artery is presented. Attention to this previously undescribed complication may allow for timely treatment with emergency surgery or thrombolysis. 
Compartment syndrome of the foot after intraarticular calcaneal fracture. Seventeen patients with a total of 21 intraarticular calcaneal fractures were examined at up to 30 days after trauma for the development of tissue pressure in the central plantar muscle compartment. Twelve patients had a significant increase in tissue pressure with values greater than 30 mmHg because of primary fracture hematoma or interstitial fluid accumulation. This increase in pressure persisted for three to five days after trauma, so that ischemic damage to the short plantar foot muscles had to be suspected. Plantar muscle scarring and claw-toe formation were observed in seven patients with a total of 11 fractures during a mean observation period of 18 months. The plantar aponeurosis, which forms the constricting fascial envelope of the plantar muscles, is the anatomic structure responsible for the compartment syndrome that may develop after calcaneal fracture. Therefore, to avoid functional deficit, plantar compartmental pressures should be regularly measured after calcaneal fracture. Significantly increased plantar tissue pressure greater than 30 mmHg should be relieved by longitudinal incision of the plantar aponeurosis, preferably by a plantar incision as soon as the diagnosis is made. 
IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in acute and chronic hepatitis C. To assess possible role of testing for IgM-specific antibody in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with hepatitis C, we tested sera from 14 patients with acute and 97 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis for IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 93% of acute cases and 91% of chronic cases. Of the 101 patients with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, 57% had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. None of the 20 healthy subjects or 40 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis A or hepatitis B had IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus. At the onset of clinical symptoms in acute hepatitis C, IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 8 (57%) and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus in 9 of 14 patients (64%). Eventually, both IgG and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus became detectable in 13 of 14 patients with acute hepatitis C. Seven patients with antibody to hepatitis C virus resolved the acute infection within 6 mo and all seven cleared IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus, whereas two cleared IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus. Six patients had a chronic outcome of the acute infection and IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in detectable amounts for more than 6 mo in all (mean = 15.5 mo). Among 88 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis with IgG antibody to hepatitis C virus, IgM antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 45 (51%). 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Efficacy of desipramine in painful diabetic neuropathy: a placebo-controlled trial. Although amitriptyline relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, side effects often preclude effective treatment. Desipramine has the least anticholinergic and sedative effects of the first generation tricyclic antidepressants. We compared a 6 week course of desipramine (mean dose, 201 mg/day) to active placebo in 20 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy in a double-blind crossover trial. Pain relief with desipramine was statistically significant in weeks 5 and 6. Eleven patients reported at least moderate relief with desipramine, compared to 2 with placebo. Pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. We conclude that desipramine relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, offering an alternative for patients unable to tolerate amitriptyline. Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, an action shared by desipramine, amitriptyline, and other antidepressants proven effective in neuropathic pain, may mediate this analgesic effect. 
Cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis in Coats' disease. A 28-year-old man with unilateral Coats' disease and cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis underwent successful juxtafoveolar argon green laser photocoagulation therapy with resolution of the edema and improvement in metamorphopsia and visual acuity. Despite this success, the effect of laser therapy in these patients remains uncertain. It should be considered only after detailed discussion with the patient about the possibility of posttreatment paracentral scotomata and the alternative of a reasonable period of observation for possible spontaneous resolution of the edema. 
Hypertonic saline resuscitation: efficacy in a community-based burn unit. Many have discussed hypertonic saline for resuscitation in burned patients only to discourage its use or to emphasize it only as a research tool and not as standard resuscitation. We reviewed the records of 47 adults with burns over 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA) in whom hypertonic saline was used as standard resuscitation fluid in a large community burn unit. The solution consisted of sodium, 300 mEq/L, acetate, 200 mEq/L, and chloride, 100 mEq/L, with an osmolality of 600 mOsm/L. The mean TBSA burned was 37% and the mean patient age was 44.8 years. Eighteen patients (mean age 39.7 years, mean TBSA burned 27%) received hypertonic saline alone. They required an average of 75% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value over the first 48 hours was 44.2% and the mean serum sodium level was 141.6 mEq/L. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 51.8 years, mean TBSA burned 47.8%) received hypertonic saline plus colloid (albumin or fresh frozen plasma). Colloid was used in older patients with more serious burns. This group required 57% of the Parkland calculated volume to achieve a urinary output of 1 mL/kg/hr. The mean hematocrit value was 45.1% and mean sodium level was 143.8 mEq/L. The mean weight gain for both groups was 7.3% of the admission weight. None of the patients had changes in pH or renal function. All patients survived the resuscitation phase of their injury; the overall death rate was 49%. We conclude that hypertonic saline is a safe, effective means of resuscitation even in a community-based unit. It allows less fluid to be delivered for adequate resuscitation. The usual hyponatremia, hemoconcentration, and significant weight gain associated with administration of isotonic solutions was avoided. Colloid may further improve the resuscitation capabilities of hypertonic saline. 
Immediate versus deferred beta-blockade following thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II-B Study In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving ventricular function or reducing mortality. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
The significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 
Amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. Amiodarone has been shown to produce microvesicular steatosis of the liver in some recipients. We have determined the effects of amiodarone on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice. In vitro, the formation of 14C-acid-soluble beta-oxidation products from [U-14C]palmitic acid by mouse liver mitochondria was decreased by 92% in the presence of 125 microM amiodarone and by 94% in the presence of 125 microM N-desethylamiodarone. Inhibition due to 100 or 150 microM amiodarone persisted in the presence of 5 mM acetoacetate, whereas acetoacetate totally relieved inhibition due to 15 microM rotenone. In vivo, exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [U-14C]palmitic acid was decreased by 31, 40, 58 and 78%, respectively, in mice receiving 19, 25, 50 and 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride 1 hr before the administration of [U-14C]palmitic acid. One hour after 100 mg.kg-1, the exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid, [1-14C]octanoic acid or [1-14C]butyric acid was decreased by 78, 72 and 53%, respectively. Exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid was normal between 6 and 9 hr after administration of 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride, but was still inhibited by 71 and 37%, 24 and 48 hr after 600 mg.kg-1. Twenty four hours after the latter dose of amiodarone, hepatic triglycerides were increased by 150%, and there was microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. 
DNA analysis of atrial myxomas. The atrial myxoma is a primary tumor of the heart which may have an uncertain clinical course. In this study, we performed flow cytometric DNA analysis of 15 paraffin-embedded atrial myxomas and correlated DNA ploidy status and proliferative fraction with clinical findings. Twelve of 15 cases (80 percent) were diploid and the remaining three cases (20 percent) were aneuploid. Two patients with aneuploid histograms were free of tumor at the time follow-up; the third patient experienced local tumor recurrence and metastases. Five patients with diploid myxomas demonstrated an elevated (greater than or equal to 17 percent) proliferative cell cycle fraction; four of these patients experienced embolic phenomenon or tumor recurrence. This pilot study suggests that an atrial myxoma with either aneuploid DNA content or elevated proliferative fraction may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior. 
Assessment of the psychological impact of a breast screening programme. In order to assess the psychological effect of mammographic screening, questionnaires (which included psychometric tests) were sent to 750 women at invitation and, 6 weeks after screening, to 420 women normal after the first mammograph, to 240 women normal after special assessment, and to 68 women normal after open biopsy. Increasing degree of the investigation was associated both with increasing frequency of breast self examination (10% were practising breast self-examination at least once a week before screening compared with 24% for women after special assessment and 35% of women who had had an open biopsy (p less than 0.001)), and with greater confidence that any malignancy in the breast would have been found. Psychometric scores showed no increase of general levels of anxiety or depression in the screened groups. For anxiety, percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 2 and 6 for the four groups, respectively, and for depression the percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 4 and 6, respectively; 10% of screened women were more anxious about having breast cancer as a result of the screening. At least 10% of women proceeding to open biopsy of benign lesions require professional counselling and support. Psychological ill effects were not detected by the psychometric test among women who did not proceed to this final investigation. Behavioural changes did suggest a raised awareness or fear of potential cancer among the screened population. 
Neurologic outcome after electroencephalographically proven neonatal seizures. Infants in whom neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings were retrospectively examined to determine their global neurologic outcome and the specific frequency of epilepsy, development delay, and cerebral palsy. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to the neurologic outcome. Forty infants with EEG documented seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration. 
Sudden cardiac death: management of high-risk patients Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. 
Serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: relation to liver fibrosis and arthritis. Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis. 
Delayed sleep phase syndrome response to melatonin. The actions of melatonin on the sleep-wake cycle were investigated by means of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 8 subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome attending a sleep disorders clinic. In randomised order the subjects received placebo or melatonin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks with a 1 week washout period between the treatments. Drug or placebo was given at 2200 h, 5 h before the mean time of sleep onset determined by pretrial sleep logs. In all 8 subjects sleep onset time (mean advance 82 [range 19-124] min; p less than 0.01) and wake time (117 [10-187] min; p less than 0.01) were significantly earlier during melatonin treatment than during placebo. Mean total sleep time was slightly less on melatonin (8 h 12 min) than on placebo (8 h 46 min). Alertness acrophase calculated from the subjects' ratings of alertness made every 2 h while awake was unaltered. Melatonin may act as a phase-setter for sleep-wake cycles in subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome. 
Overseas fatalities of United States citizen travelers: an analysis of deaths related to international travel. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies of travel-related mortality and morbidity have been limited to nonfatal events. Causes of travel-related mortality may differ significantly from morbidity and thus have different prevention strategies. DESIGN: We examined the overseas fatalities of US citizen travelers for the years 1975 and 1984. The death certificates were abstracted; all deaths under age 60 and a 20% sample of deaths 60 and older were examined. SETTING AND TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All overseas travel fatalities of US citizens were examined excluding those occurring in Canada. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) and injuries accounted for 49% and 25% of the overseas deaths of US citizen travelers, respectively. Infectious diseases other than pneumonia accounted for only 1% of the deaths. Eighty percent of injury deaths occurred outside of hospitals. Injury death rates for male travelers were greater than US age-specific death rates. CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on the prevention of fatal events, especially those resulting from injury, must be given by physicians and other individuals and organizations who advise travelers. Further studies are needed to explore the issues of preventable injury deaths, emergency medical services, and overseas travel. 
Twenty-four-hour blood pressure control with isradipine in mild essential hypertension. The hypotensive effect of isradipine was assessed in 26 male patients, aged 40 to 64 years, with hypertension. After withdrawal of previous antihypertensive treatment and a four-week placebo period, patients were randomized into a double-blind active-treatment period of eight weeks to receive either placebo or 1.25 to 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured by Accutracker (Suntech, Oxford, England) after the placebo period and at the end of the active-treatment period. In the isradipine group n = 13), both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and number of blood pressure spikes decreased significantly (P less than .0001), whereas there was a significant increase of these variables in the placebo control group (n = 13). The results of this study indicate that, in these subjects, blood pressure control was achieved throughout the 24-h period by monotherapy with isradipine. 
Damage to tissue defenses by EMLA cream. EMLA is a new topical agent that safely anesthetizes intact skin. The purpose of this study was to determine if this cream could be safely used for anesthetizing wounds. This investigation evaluated the potential toxicity of EMLA cream in wounds by measuring its effect on host defenses and on the biology of wound repair. In contaminated wounds, EMLA cream elicited an exaggerated inflammatory response that damaged host defenses, inviting the development of infection. As a result of these investigations, we do not recommend the use of EMLA cream in wounds. 
Carotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case. The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces. Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus. We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula. The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma. 
Ethnic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales. OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade. 
Effect of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium-201 image quality To determine the effect of different types of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium image quality, 78 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three protocols: dipyridamole infusion alone, dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip, and dipyridamole with low-level treadmill exercise. Heart-to-lung, heart-to-liver, and heart-to-adjacent infradiaphragmatic activity ratios were generated from anterior images acquired immediately following the test. Additionally, heart-to-total infradiaphragmatic activity was graded semiquantitatively. Results showed a significantly higher ratio of heart to subdiaphragmatic activity in the treadmill group as compared with dipyridamole alone (p less than 0.001) and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise (p less than 0.001). No significant difference was observed between patients receiving the dipyridamole infusion, and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise. We conclude that low-level treadmill exercise supplementation of dipyridamole infusion is an effective means of improving image quality. Supplementation with isometric handgrip does not improve image quality over dipyridamole alone. 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft. We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms. This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent. All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent. 
Mammographic follow-up of nonpalpable low-suspicion breast abnormalities: one versus two views. A retrospective study involving 498 women with a total of 666 breast lesions was undertaken to determine the relative efficacy of one- and two-view mammography in the follow-up evaluation of "low-suspicion" abnormal mammographic findings. These abnormalities consisted of well-defined masses (47.1%), well-defined punctate microcalcifications (20.9%), and parenchymal asymmetry (32.0%). Confidence in the adequacy of the single-view follow-up was high in 91% of cases. The addition of the second mammographic view changed the one-view interpretation in approximately 1% of all cases. Two cancers were detected during the initial follow-up period. Both cancers were detected with single-view and standard two-view follow-up examinations, with high confidence. In this controlled retrospective study, the single-view follow-up examination was adequate for follow-up of most low-suspicion mammographic abnormalities. Monitoring by physicians, however, would be necessary to prevent an unacceptable number of patient recalls, which could make the one-view follow-up study impractical to use in some practices. 
The "two week syndrome" associated with injection treatment for chronic pain--fact or fiction? Many patients attending the pain clinic for regular injections of local anaesthetic state that the pain returned "two weeks" ago. This study demonstrates that 85% of these patients have a "return of pain" interval which coincides with the proximity of their next clinic appointment. 
Choledochal cyst and biliary atresia in the neonate: imaging findings in five cases. The radiologic findings in five neonates with choledochal cyst associated with extra-hepatic biliary atresia are described. All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools. In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown. The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases. All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis. Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction. The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management. 
Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 1. Developing and established hypertrophy. The effects of a large arteriovenous fistula on left and right ventricular hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats at 1 week and 1 month after surgery. Cardiac output, left ventricular function, and right ventricular function were evaluated before obtaining isolated myocytes for cell size measurements. Average heart weight increased 35% at 1 week and 86% at 1 month in rats with fistulas. In general, myocyte hypertrophy was due to a proportional increase in length and width (length/width ratio remained constant). This change was more evident in the large hearts from rats with 1-month fistulas. At both the 1-week and 1-month intervals, the hypertrophic response of right ventricular myocytes was slightly greater than that observed in the left ventricle or interventricular septum. Left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced at 1 week but returned to normal after 1 month of overloading. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased approximately fivefold and twofold at 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Right ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were increased at both intervals examined. We conclude that severe volume overloading from a large aortocaval fistula in the rat is characterized by 1) depressed left ventricular function at 1 week followed by a large compensatory hypertrophy and near normal function at 1 month, 2) right ventricular pressure overload, and 3) changes in myocyte shape that resemble normal physiological growth. 
Initial clinical trial of EXOSURF, a protein-free synthetic surfactant, for the prophylaxis and early treatment of hyaline membrane disease. EXOSURF is a protein-free surfactant composed of 85% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 9% hexadecanol, and 6% tyloxapol by weight. A single dose of 5 mL of EXOSURF per kilogram body weight, which gave 67 mg of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine per kilogram body weight, or 5 mL/kg air was given intratracheally in each of two controlled trials: at birth to neonates 700 through 1350 g (the prophylactic trial, n = 74) or at 4 to 24 hours after birth to neonates greater than 650 g who had hyaline membrane disease severe enough to require mechanical ventilation (the rescue trial, n = 104). In both studies, time-averaged inspired oxygen concentrations and mean airway pressures during the 72 hours after entry decreased significantly (P less than .05) in the treated neonates when compared with control neonates. Thirty-six percent of the treated neonates in the rescue study had an incomplete response to treatment or relapsed within 24 hours, suggesting the need for retreatment in some neonates. In the rescue trial, risk-adjusted survival increased significantly in the treated group. There were no significant differences in intracranial hemorrhages, chronic lung disease, or symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus between control and treated infants in either trial. 
"Heartstart Scotland"--initial experience of a national scheme for out of hospital defibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome of out of hospital defibrillation in Scotland during the year after the introduction of automated external defibrillators in October 1988. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances. 
Colonic ischemia complicating immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Colonic ischemia (CI) is a rare complication of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy. This complication occurred in three of 141 patients (2.1%) with metastatic cancer treated with high-dose IL-2 therapy; CI only developed in patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN) with IL-2 (three of 21, 14%) compared with none of 120 in those patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.0009). Severe diarrhea (greater than or equal to 7 bowel movements/day) also was significantly more common in patients receiving IFN with IL-2 (six of 21, 29%) than in those receiving IL-2 alone (three of 120, 2.5%, P equals 0.001) and preceded the clinical diagnosis of CI in all three patients. Three of nine patients with severe diarrhea had CI. Hematochezia occurred in four patients, all of whom received IFN with IL-2; three had CI, and the other patient had nonspecific colitis. Differences in vasopressor use did not explain the increased risk of CI in patients receiving IFN; those receiving IFN with IL-2 required phenylephrine less often than patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.01). The administration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells had no significant effect on the incidence of CI, severe diarrhea, peritonitis, or vasopressor use; two of three patients with CI, however, had their ischemic episode within 24 hours after the last of three LAK cell infusions. In conclusion, CI is an unusual complication of high-dose IL-2 and IFN immunotherapy. In patients receiving such combination therapy, severe diarrhea is a risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CI. 
Carcinoma of the pancreas: a personal experience with 100 cases. One hundred patients with pancreatic cancer were evaluated between March 1981 and December 1989. This study showed that 61 were not candidates for definitive surgery because of nonoperability (28 patients) or nonresectability (33 patients). An additional 25 patients had cancers that were unresectable because of metastases (13 patients) or local spread of disease (12 patients) discovered at laparotomy. Fourteen patients had resectable cancers. Ten were treated by total pancreatectomy, three by distal pancreatectomy and one by pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple). There were two operative mortalities. The median patient survival time was 20.5 months. Two patients survived 5 years. Five patients are alive at 3, 14, 18, and 47 months. Palliative surgical procedures performed in 18 patients included 10 biliary bypasses, 9 gastrojejunostomies, and 6 T-tube placements. This was associated with an operative mortality rate of 11%. The median survival time was 5 months. Other palliative measures included endoscopic placement of biliary and pancreatic stents (47 patients, 2.7% mortality rate), endoluminal radiation therapy, interstitial radiation therapy and external beam radiation therapy. The median survival time of patients so treated was 4.5 months. 
Successful medical treatment of presumed Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. Few infants have been reported who survived fungal endocarditis; all have required both surgical and intensive antifungal therapy. We describe three infants, two weighing less than 1000 gm, who survived Candida endocarditis without surgery. Two had Candida parapsilosis, an agent not previously reported as a cause of neonatal endocarditis. All three infants were treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Despite administration of 44, 38, and 48 mg/kg amphotericin B, respectively, no nephrotoxicity was noted; 5-flucytosine therapy was stopped in one infant because of thrombocytopenia. One infant died of an unrelated cause 6 months later; there was no evidence of Candida or endocarditis at autopsy. The other two infants are thriving 2 and 3 years after the completion of antifungal therapy; no remaining evidence of endocarditis is present on echocardiography. We conclude that antifungal therapy without surgery is an option for Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Smoking, the oral contraceptive pill, and Crohn's disease. Both cigarette smoking and the oral contraceptive pill have been implicated as aggravating factors in Crohn's disease. Based upon the recent demonstration of multifocal gastrointestinal infarction in Crohn's disease, a possible pathogenic mechanism for this condition, we propose how smoking and the oral contraceptive pill may potentiate a tendency for focal thrombosis and hence exacerbate the activity of Crohn's disease. 
Long-term therapy of HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with recombinant interferon alpha-2a. Five young male patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) over a period of 2-2.5 years. An IFN dose of 18 x 10(6) IU was given subcutaneously every day during the first 3 months of treatment and then on alternate days. Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised. Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment. In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS. The condition of a third patient tended to become stabilized during the first 6 months of therapy, but after 60 months there has been a slow progression. The fourth and fifth patients died 25 and 28 months, respectively, after the histological diagnosis of KS and the initiation of treatment. While on therapy with rIFN-alpha-2a, no life-threatening opportunistic infections occurred. The side-effects were mostly well tolerated, and no severe changes in haematological parameters were caused by the therapy. 
Value of dual-energy CT in differentiating focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density masses. Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased. 
Abnormal expression of histocompatibility and mitochondrial antigens by cardiac tissue from patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Autoantibodies against the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex proteins, and myosin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac tissue from patients with DCM and, for control purposes, cardiac tissue from patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy and from patients with no history of cardiac disease were stained with heterologous and ANT-, BCKD-, and myosin-specific affinity-purified sera from DCM patients. Data demonstrate that although anti-myosin stains tissues from both patients and normal controls, the ANT- and BCKD-specific heterologous and affinity-purified sera from DCM patients stain only cardiac tissues from DCM patients. Intense staining in patchy areas of cardiac tissue suggests that abnormal increased expression of these putative autoantigens occurs in discrete areas of cardiac myocytes. The reactivity of the antisera was organ specific and only seen in tissues from DCM patients. The organ and disease specificity of these findings suggests that such expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human DCM. 
Nifedipine reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and transient ischemia in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. A randomized study was performed on 104 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to examine whether the infusion of nifedipine (n = 53) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and necrosis in the early postoperative period. Continuous hemodynamic and three-channel Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours and serial assessment of serum enzymes and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed for 36 hours postoperatively. Nifedipine (minimum dose, 10 micrograms/kg/hr for 24 hours) was applied from the onset of extracorporal circulation. The control group (n = 51) received nitroglycerin (minimum dose, 1 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours). Using the combined analyses of electrocardiography and Holter recordings, myocardial ischemia was defined as being either a transient ischemic event (TIE), transient coronary spasm (TCS), or myocardial infarction (MI). The two groups did not differ with respect to preoperative New York Heart Association classification, age, history of myocardial infarction, extracorporal circulation and aortic cross-clamp time, number of distal anastomoses, or systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia was substantially lower in the nifedipine than in the nitroglycerin group [TIE: three of 53 patients (6%) versus nine of 50 patients (18%), p less than 0.001; MI: two of 53 patients (4%) versus six of 50 patients (12%), p less than 0.001; and TCS: none of 53 patients (0%) versus two of 50 patients (4%), p = NS]. 
Prevention of stroke and brain damage with calcium antagonists in animals. In a rat model of embolic stroke (permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [MCAO]), various 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to attenuate brain damage and the resultant functional impairment when administered after MCAO. Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy. 
The relationship between large airway inflammation and airway metaplasia. To assess the role of acute inflammatory cells in large airways in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, we performed BAL (divided into aliquots) and mucosal biopsies on asbestos workers. They had evidence of asbestos-related lung injury. We found that acute inflammatory cells were significantly increased in the first aliquot. Ex-smokers had a greater percentage of PMN compared with nonsmokers and current smokers. The subjects were subgrouped with respect to biopsy-detected metaplasia. There was no difference between these groups for percentage or total number of PMN in the first aliquot. However, subjects with metaplasia had significant reduction in FEV1/FVC compared with those without. We conclude that there are significant differences in cells between the first and subsequent aliquots. Although inflammatory stimuli may be important in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, PMN present in the first aliquot could not be related to the severity of the metaplastic changes in these workers. 
Risks of leaving the gallbladder in situ after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones. There is controversy concerning the subsequent clinical course of patients whose gallbladder is left in situ following successful endoscopic removal of stones from their common bile ducts. A total of 191 patients (median age 76 years) were reviewed between 12 and 100 months (mean 38 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Ten patients (5.2 per cent) had symptoms requiring cholecystectomy which was uneventful, nine in the first year. Cholangitis at presentation or failure to fill the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were not helpful in identifying these patients. Forty-nine (25.6 per cent) patients died during the review period from non-biliary pathology (usually cardiovascular). Elective cholecystectomy is not required in elderly patients with symptomatic bile duct stones if the common bile duct can be cleared of stones after endoscopic sphincterotomy. 
Carcinoma of the cervix treated with radiation therapy. I. A multi-variate analysis of prognostic variables in the Gynecologic Oncology Group. Between 1977 and 1985, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted three clinical trials in locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix, clinical Stages I to IVA as classified by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). All 626 patients had primary carcinoma of the cervix and underwent operative assessment of the para-aortic (PA) lymph nodes. Patients received standardized external radiation therapy to the pelvis or to the pelvis and PA lymph nodes followed by one or two brachytherapy applications. To date, no statistically significant differences in progression-free interval (PFI) or survival time have been identified between the randomization treatment arms on any of these studies. Basic similarities among these studies led us to pool these data to identify patient characteristics and tumor characteristics associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. Multi-variate analysis showed patient age, performance status (PS), PA lymph node status, tumor size, and pelvic node status to be significantly associated with PFI. When modeling for survival, all these factors and clinical stage and bilateral extension were significant. 
Intrahepatic spontaneous arterioportal fistula: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and angiographic treatment. A 54-yr-old male with portal hypertension received ineffective medical therapy for the diagnosis of portal hepatic cirrhosis. Duplex ultrasound (US) revealed pulsatile arterial flow in the right main portal vein. The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic arterioportal fistula was established and confirmed by angiography. Right hepatic artery embolization with three coils was performed. The patient is alive for 16 months after the embolization, and his complaints have disappeared. There has been full resorption of ascites and absence of varices. Nine previously reported similar cases are reviewed. 
Transvaginal sonographic follow-up on the formation of fetal cephalocele at 13-19 weeks' gestation. An occipital meningocele was detected by transvaginal sonography in a fetus of 13 weeks' gestation. This changed at 14 weeks to a cephalocele, which disappeared at 15-16 weeks and was detected again at 19 weeks. It is possible that sliding backward and forward of the herniated brain tissue caused this sequence of events. 
Respiratory problems in emergence from anesthesia. In conclusion, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation have major effects on respiratory function, both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation. The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation. Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door. Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications. 
Red cell deformability is an early indicator of infection. Red blood cells (RBC) have been shown to become less deformable during infection. The RBC deformability index (DI) was measured within 24 hours of admission in 37 patients who had suffered trauma and every 48 to 72 hours thereafter while they were in the surgical intensive care unit to assess whether DI could be used as an early indicator of infection after injury. Infection was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees F or more and a white blood cell count of more than 12,000/cm3 associated with a positive culture. Eighteen patients developed an infection, and 19 patients did not. On day 1, both groups showed a significant decrease in DI, compared to controls (0.33 +/- 0.18 and 0.34 +/- 0.25 for patients with infection and patients with no infection vs 1.52 +/- 0.12 for control volunteers; p less than 0.05). In the group with no infection, the DI improved in 16 of 19 patients after injury; the DI in patients with infection continued to decrease in 17 of 18 patients. The decrease in DI occurred 4 +/- 2 days (range, 2 to 8 days) before the diagnosis of infection. No significant differences were apparent in the absolute white blood cell count between the group with infection and the group with no infection at any time after injury. Differences in maximal temperature were noted on day 3 and beyond; however, 30% of patients with no infection had a temperature of more than 101 degrees F for 7 days. These data show that trauma results in a significant decrease in RBC deformability and that serial changes in DI appeared to predict which patients would develop an infection and which patients would recover uneventfully. RBC deformability may be helpful in early detection of infection in patients who have suffered trauma. 
Sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Nonulcer dyspepsia is a common clinical syndrome whose etiology is unknown. The sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia was studied. The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents. 
Fever response in elderly nursing home residents: are the older truly colder? OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that many nursing home residents with an apparently blunted fever response (maximum temperature less than 101 degrees F) may actually have a significant change in temperature (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) which is not recognized because of a low baseline temperature. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for cases of infection that met specific criteria and for chart-recorded baseline and infection temperatures. Chart-recorded baseline temperatures were prospectively compared with re-measurement of morning temperatures. SETTING: Nursing Home Care Unit of the VAMC West Los Angeles. PATIENTS: Random review of 40 residents' charts resulted in the detection of 69 infections among 26 residents over a 20-month period. Fifty randomly selected residents prospectively underwent comparison of chart-determined and actual re-measurement of baseline temperatures. RESULTS: In 50 randomly selected residents, the mean oral baseline temperature of 97.4 +/- 0.2 (degrees F +/- SEM) closely approximated the mean nurse-recorded measures in the charts (97.6 +/- 0.1). Chart review detected 69 infections among 26 residents, with 53 episodes having a temperature recorded during the infection. The mean maximum temperature (Tmax) during an infection was 101.3 +/- 0.3 (degrees F +/- SEM) but 47% (25/53) of the episodes had a "blunted" fever response (Tmax less than 101 degrees F). Of the 25 "blunted" fevers (Tmax less than 101 degrees F), about one-fourth demonstrated an adequate change in temperature from baseline (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) but failed to reach 101 degrees F because of a low baseline. Most infections (89%) had a Tmax greater than 99 degrees F. CONCLUSION: Establishing a nursing home patient's basal temperature and monitoring for changes in temperature (delta T greater than 2.4 degrees F) and/or lowering the threshold for recognition of fevers (to 99 degrees or 100 degrees F) in nursing home residents with a change in function should assist in early recognition of infections. 
Primary tumors of the facial (extracranial) nerve. Nearly 25% of all primary neurogenous tumors arise from peripheral nerves in the head and neck. The extracranial parts of the facial nerve, however, rank low as potential sites. Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease. 
Carcinoma of the uterus: use of gadopentetate dimeglumine in MR imaging. This prospective study assessed the role of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the detection and staging of carcinomas of the endometrium and cervix. Surgical-pathologic findings were used as the standard of reference. In the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma, contrast-enhanced imaging improved tumor detection and differentiation between viable tumor and retained debris. Use of contrast material significantly improved the staging accuracy. The ability to assess the depth of myometrial invasion was also improved. In the evaluation of cervical carcinoma, assessment of tumor location and size did not improve following contrast enhancement. Use of gadopentetate dimeglumine resulted in overestimation of stromal, parametrial, vaginal, and/or bladder wall invasion in eight patients. However, evaluation of intratumoral architecture and large lesions was easier with contrast-enhanced imaging. When only stage II and higher disease was analyzed, use of contrast material improved the evaluation of disease extent. The authors conclude that gadolinium enhancement adds to the accuracy of evaluation of endometrial carcinoma but is useful in only advanced cases of cervical carcinoma. 
Osteogenic sarcoma arising adjacent to a long-standing ameloblastoma. A case report. Ameloblastoma is an uncommon odontogenic tumor usually occurring in the mandible. Rarely do other primary tumors occur with or arise from ameloblastoma. We describe a patient with simultaneous osteogenic sarcoma of the maxilla and recurrent ameloblastoma. 
Postradiation lower motor neuron syndrome presenting as monomelic amyotrophy. Monomelic amyotrophy developed 16 months, nine and 12 years after irradiation of the lumbosacral spinal cord for seminoma in one patient and for Hodgkin's disease in two others. In two patients, involvement was clinically limited to one leg, with a subacute course followed by plateau in the first case and with progressive worsening in the second one. In the third patient, the course was progressive with involvement of the other lower limb occurring five years later. From clinical and electrophysiological data, it seems probable that the disease process was a result of a selective injury to the lower motor neuron in the lower spinal cord. 
Right-to-left shunt across a patent foramen ovale caused by cardiac tamponade: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade can manifest as profound hypoxemia from intracardiac shunting across a patent foramen ovale. As a consequence, pulmonary embolus can be erroneously diagnosed. As demonstrated in the case described herein, transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in determining the correct diagnosis, especially if transthoracic echocardiography is technically limited. In our patient, the findings on transesophageal echocardiography also helped determine the appropriate treatment. The relative inaccessibility of the pericardial effusion to needle drainage prompted open surgical drainage. 
EMG activity in pericranial muscles during postural variation and mental activity in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic tension type headache. EMG activity was recorded over frontalis, temporalis and trapezius muscles in a supine position, a standing position and during a mental task in 32 female patients suffering from chronic tension-type headache and in 20 healthy volunteers. Measurements in patients were made before and after biofeedback therapy. All EMG levels were on average significantly higher in patients than in controls. 62.5% of patients had at least one abnormal EMG level, but only 34% were beyond the normal range, if 1 muscle and 1 recording condition was considered. EMG levels were not correlated with headache severity, anxiety or response to biofeedback treatment. It is therefore suggested that pericranial EMG activity is not pathogenetic in chronic tension type headache, but merely one of several pathophysiologic changes, that are produced by a central dysfunction. 
Anterior uveitis and hypopyon. We undertook a study to determine the incidence of hypopyon, as well as the most common anterior uveitis entities with which hypopyon is associated. A total of 216 patients with anterior uveitis were studied. The uveitis was acute in 155. Of the 155 patients, 11 (7.1%) had hypopyon. Nine of the 11 patients with hypopyon were positive for HLA B27. Of these nine, two had Reiter's syndrome and one had ankylosing spondylitis; the other six had no confirmed systemic disease. Of the two patients with hypopyon who were HLA B27-negative, one had mixed connective-tissue vascular disease, and one had idiopathic anterior uveitis. Of the 155 patients with acute anterior uveitis, 62 were HLA B27-positive. Thus, the incidence of hypopyon uveitis among HLA B27-positive patients was 14.5% (nine of 62 patients), whereas the incidence among HLA B27-negative patients was only 2.2% (two of 93 patients). These results suggest that HLA B27-related anterior uveitis is the most common cause of hypopyon uveitis, and that most patients with anterior uveitis associated with hypopyon will test positive for HLA B27. Although these results reflect a referral population, they should be of benefit in the treatment of patients with anterior uveitis. 
Concurrent eosinophilic fasciitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eosinophilic fasciitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome of T-cell malignant neoplasms? Eosinophilic fasciitis has been reported to precede hematologic malignant neoplasms such as myelomonocytic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this case study, eosinophilic fasciitis occurred concurrently with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was based on painful sclerodermatous lesions on the extremities and trunk without acrosclerosis. There was histologic confirmation with edema and lymphocytic inflammation in the superficial muscular fascia and dermis. Deposition of immune reactants was found in the fascia and dermis. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia and circulating immune complexes were detected. The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) was based on extensive erythematous cutaneous plaques, dermal and epidermal lymphocytic atypia, loss of pan-T-cell immunologic markers, and a cutaneous lesional T-cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement by Southern blot analysis. Eosinophilic fasciitis may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hematologic malignant neoplasms, including mycosis fungoides. Cytokines or lymphokines released by activated immunocytes, either malignant leukocytes or normal leukocytes reacting to malignant cells, may be responsible for the eosinophilia and sclerosis seen in these associated hematologic malignant neoplasms. 
Adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. 
Asperger's syndrome: who is being abused? Six case histories of children referred and admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit at a tertiary referral centre because of concerns about poor functioning and possible emotional abuse are presented. On initial assessment the children appeared to be well functioning and the impression was confirmed that their emotional needs were not being met by their parents. After detailed inpatient appraisal the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made in all six cases, exemplified mainly by a formal concrete way of thinking and an inability to identify and understand human emotions and relationships. The impact of the diagnosis on the parents and their consequent relationships with their child and their willingness to work with professionals is discussed. 
Large molecular form of serum HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: relation to liver cell damage. We have separated circulating HBeAg into small and large molecular forms by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed the relationship between the two forms and other clinical features of chronic hepatitis B, especially in regard to liver cell damage. The large HBeAg accounted for 7.3% +/- 3.4% of serum HBeAg in 9 subjects with normal liver histological findings or nonspecific reactive hepatitis, 38.0% +/- 27.8% in 32 patients with chronic persistent hepatitis and 65.6% +/- 23.3% in 21 patients with chronic active hepatitis (p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was seen between the height of aminotransferase elevations and the percentage of large HBeAg. Three patients who progressed from histologically normal liver or nonspecific reactive hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis had dramatic increases in the percentage of large HBeAg. The finding that the presence of large HBeAg in serum correlated with the severity of hepatitis suggests that HBeAg may play an important role in determining the degree of liver injury in chronic hepatitis B. 
Ischaemic myelopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in AIDS. A 39-year-old patient with AIDS presented with a rapidly progressive myelopathy with a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. He died, 9 weeks after onset of the first neurological signs, from diffuse encephalopathy. Neuropathological examination revealed multiple, usually small, frequently haemorrhagic, infarcts or various ages and numerous fibrin thrombi in medium and small penetrating vessels and capillaries of the brain and spinal cord, characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were no inflammatory changes. Immunohistochemical studies for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 were negative. Ischaemic spinal cord lesions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may represent an unusual cause of focal, non-inflammatory, non-tumoral, myelopathic syndrome in AIDS. 
Infection by mink cell focus-forming viruses confers interleukin 2 (IL-2) independence to an IL-2-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line. The development of T-cell lymphomas in rodents infected with type C retroviruses has been linked to the generation of a class of envelope (env) recombinant viruses called mink cell focus-forming viruses (MCF viruses) in the preleukemic thymus. To determine whether infection by MCF viruses altered the growth phenotype of retrovirus-induced T-cell lymphomas, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line (4437A) was infected with MCF-247, modified MCF-V33 (mMCF-V33), or NZB-xenotropic (NZB-X) virus. The effects of virus infection on the IL-2 dependence of these cells was examined by cultivating them in the absence of IL-2. After IL-2 withdrawal, the uninfected and NZB-X-infected cells went through a crisis period characterized by massive death. All the independently maintained cultures of MCF- and mMCF-V33-infected cells, on the other hand, became IL-2 independent without a crisis. All the polytropic virus-infected IL-2-independent cultures contained a population of cells that was polyclonal with regard to polytropic provirus integration. Over this polyclonal background each culture produced multiple clones of cells that were selected rapidly after IL-2 withdrawal. Furthermore, the resulting MCF- or mMCF-V33-infected IL-2-independent cells retained the expression of IL-2 receptor. These data show that MCF and mMCF-V33 viruses may alter the growth phenotype of a T-cell lymphoma line and suggest that their effect on cell growth may be due to the direct interaction of the MCF envelope glycoprotein with cellular components, perhaps the IL-2 receptor. 
Pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis. The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes. The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes. The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together. Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions. 
Acanthoma fissuratum. Acanthoma fissuratum secondary to the use of spectacles is a rare clinical finding associated with an ill-fitting frame. An interesting case is presented to highlight such a problem. Surgical excision of such lesions is recommended with advice to the patient regarding the suitable fitting of spectacles. 
Electrophysiologic and anatomic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia induced at the right ventricular outflow tract but not at the apex. The site of ventricular stimulation is an important variable in the initiation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed ventricular stimulation. Among 169 patients studied consecutively, 17 (10%) had ventricular tachycardia induced by programmed electrical stimulation from the right ventricular outflow tract but not from the apex. Fourteen of these 17 patients had had prior myocardial infarction (12 had inferior, and two had both inferior and anterior myocardial infarction), two had a dilated cardiomyopathy, and one had a localized cardiomyopathy. Fourteen patients had echocardiograms suitable for analysis. Of these, 12 had posterior/inferior ventricular wall motion abnormalities located at the base of the heart. The ventricular effective refractory periods from the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricular apex were 237 +/- 4 and 244 +/- 5 msec, respectively (p less than 0.05, mean +/- SEM). Induced VT had a cycle length of 229 +/- 4 msec and had the morphology of right bundle branch block in 12 patients, of left bundle branch block in three patients, and had both morphologies in two patients. In 14 patients the axis was superior. VT was initiated with two extrastimuli in 15 patients and with burst right ventricular pacing in two patients. Similar pacing techniques with identical pacing intervals did not induce VT at the right ventricular apex in 14 of these 17 patients. Further, among the 15 patients whose VT was induced at the right ventricular outflow tract with two extrastimuli, neither burst pacing (n = 13) nor two extrastimuli introduced at faster paced rates (n = 12) induced VT at the right ventricular apex. 
Effect of bile diversion and sphincterotomy on gallbladder muscle contractility and gallstone formation. Feeding prairie dogs a diet rich in cholesterol induces gallstone formation that is preceded by a sustained decrease in gallbladder smooth muscle contractility. Sphincterotomy is known to prevent gallstone formation in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Experiments were designed to determine whether the effect of sphincterotomy is a consequence of hepatic bile diversion, and whether bile diversion prevents the altered contractility. Following sham operation, surgical biliary enteric bypass, or sphincterotomy, prairie dogs were fed a high-cholesterol or a regular diet. Gallbladder muscle contractility and the presence of crystals and stones were determined. In sham-operated animals, the cholesterol diet induced a decrease in gallbladder muscle contractility and caused the formation of cholesterol gallstones. In animals with bile diversion and sphincterotomy, the effects of cholesterol feeding were reduced or prevented. Thus, these procedures may prevent stone formation by preventing a reduction in gallbladder contractility. Contractility was depressed in animals with bile diversion fed a regular diet, compared with animals with a sham operation fed a regular diet. The mechanism for this depression may differ from that induced by the cholesterol diet. Diversion, and perhaps sphincterotomy, impairs gallbladder filling. Thus, gallbladder muscle is not stretched and does not contract against a load. This could result in a "disuse atrophy." If the results from our study apply to humans, sphincterotomy may reduce stone formation by preventing the effects of lithogenic bile on gallbladder muscle contractility and by enhancing the ability of the muscle to empty the lithogenic bile. 
Antibody to hepatitis C is common among patients with alcoholic liver disease with and without risk factors. Thirty-seven patients with clinically suspected alcoholic liver disease were retrospectively studied for the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay. Twenty-four had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Nineteen had identifiable risk factors for non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, and 18 did not. Five of 19 high-risk (26%) and 6 of 18 low-risk (33%) patients had positive antibody, compared with two of 179 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.01 for either group of alcoholics compared with blood donors). Nine of 11 ELISA-positive patients were also either positive or indeterminable by immunoblot testing. Histologic scores for parameters commonly associated with chronic viral hepatitis were numerically worse among anti-HCV-positive patients, but none reached statistical significance. Clinically, seven of 11 (64%) of anti-HCV-positive patients versus 14 of 26 (54%) anti-HCV-negative patients were Child's class C. Among the 21 Child's class C patients, seven (33%) were anti-HCV-positive versus four of 16 (25%) of Child's class A/B patients. A weak correlation between IgG and ELISA optical density was observed (r = 0.52). We conclude that antibody to hepatitis C by ELISA and immunoblot is common among alcoholics with liver disease even in the absence of known or suspected risk factors for viral hepatitis. Although hepatitis C-positive patients tended to have more severe histologic disease, neither histologic parameters nor clinical findings were adequate to predict antibody seropositivity. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the region around Cys-241 of complement component C2. Evidence for a C4b binding site. We probed the functional significance of the region around Cys-241 in human C2 by testing the hemolytic activity of a series of mutant rC2. Mutant C2 cDNA were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS cells. Wild-type rC2 had threefold higher specific hemolytic activity than native serum C2. Substitution of Gly, Ala, or Ser for Cys-241 resulted in a slightly, but significantly, increased activity. In addition, I2 had no effect on the activity of these mutant C2. Substitution of Lys for Gln-243 increased the hemolytic activity by more than two-fold. Increased activity in all cases was due to slower decay rates of the C3 convertase. Finally, substitution of Leu or Ala for Asp-240 or Ser-244, respectively, resulted in more than 100-fold decrease of hemolytic activity. The results suggest that residues 240 to 244 of human C2 represent an important structural determinant of the C4b binding site of C2a. They also confirm that Cys-241 is the residue responsible for the increased activity of C2 reacted with I2. 
Psychiatric disorders in 36 families with Wolfram syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome, who constitute about 1% of the population, are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. The Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative syndrome in which 25% of the individuals who are homozygous for the condition have severe psychiatric symptoms that lead to suicide attempts or psychiatric hospitalizations. METHOD: The authors collected questionnaires, death certificates, and hospital records for blood relatives and their spouses in 36 families of individuals with the Wolfram syndrome and compared the proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness to the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. RESULTS: The proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness significantly exceeded the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Since heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are 50-fold more common among the blood relatives than among the spouses, the larger proportion among blood relatives is evidence that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. 
Value of sonography in monitoring the therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphoma: comparison with chest radiography and CT. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of mediastinal sonography, compared with that of chest radiographs and CT, in the follow-up of patients with mediastinal lymphomas and in the prediction of clinical outcome. The sonograms, chest radiographs, and CT scans of 40 consecutive patients with Hodgkin (n = 29) and non-Hodgkin (n = 11) lymphoma obtained before and after completion of therapy were analyzed blindly and independently by three radiologists and compared with clinical outcome. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy, 12 with chemotherapy, and 19 with combined therapy. Therapeutic response was assessed from all available clinical and biochemical findings as well as from the combined results of all imaging studies performed on further follow-up. The sonograms showed obvious changes in the size and echogenicity of the mediastinal lymphomas that corresponded closely with the response to therapy. Sonography showed complete regression of the lymphomas in 30 patients who had complete remission. In five patients with incomplete remission, sonographic diagnoses were correct. All lymph nodes, irrespective of size, detected with sonography after a phase of complete remission indicated recurrence (five patients). Sonographic findings corresponded with those of CT in 25 (81%) of 31 cases. Clinical outcome suggested that the sonographic findings were more reliable in the five cases in which CT and sonographic findings conflicted. Chest radiographs were inadequate for monitoring the response of mediastinal lymphomas to therapy; in 17 (43%) of 40 cases, a false impression was obtained of the extent and therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphomas. The results of this study indicate that sonography is clearly superior to chest radiographs and comparable to CT for monitoring patients with mediastinal lymphomas. 
Pyruvate kinase activity and isozyme composition in normal fibrous tissue and fibroblastic proliferations. Pyruvate kinase (PK) was studied in 57 fibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic proliferations and normal fibrous tissue (n = 10). The specific activity was significantly increased in malignant tumors (1.67 +/- 0.25) compared with normal tissue (0.26 +/- 0.04; P less than 0.001) and benign proliferations (0.52 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.005). Although an overlap exists between aggressive fibromatosis and the benign group, high values of PK activity are indicative of Grade 2 and 3 malignancy. Significant shifts in isozyme pattern, favoring the expression of K-type subunits were found in tumors with a metastasizing potential and aggressive fibromatosis. These changes in the isozyme pattern of PK in aggressive fibromatosis may act as another argument to place them in the category of malignant fibroblastic tumors. 
Evaluation of mixed chimerism by in vitro amplification of dinucleotide repeat sequences using the polymerase chain reaction. The influence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains unknown. Increasingly sensitive detection methods have shown that MC occurs frequently. We report a highly sensitive novel method to assess MC based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simple dinucleotide repeat sequences called microsatellites have been found to vary in their repeat number between individuals. We use this variation to type donor-recipient pairs following allogeneic BMT. A panel of seven microsatellites was used to distinguish between donor and recipient cells of 32 transplants. Informative microsatellites were subsequently used to assess MC after BMT in this group of patients. Seventeen of the 32 transplants involved a donor of opposite sex; hence, cytogenetics and Y chromosome-specific PCR were also used as an index of chimerism in these patients. MC was detected in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in 18 of 32 patients (56%) by PCR. In several cases, only stored slide material was available for analysis but PCR of microsatellites or Y chromosomal material could be used successfully to assess the origin of cells in this archival material. Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 17 patients and MC was detected in three patients. Twelve patients received T-cell-depleted marrow and showed a high incidence of MC as revealed by PCR (greater than 80%). Twenty patients received unmanipulated marrow, and while the incidence of MC was lower (44%), this was a high percentage when compared with other studies. Once MC was detected, the percentages of recipient cells tended to increase. However, in patients exhibiting MC who subsequently relapsed, this increase was relatively sudden. The overall level of recipient cells in the group of MC patients who subsequently relapsed was higher than in those who exhibited stable MC. Thus, while the occurrence of MC was not indicative of a poor prognosis per se, sudden increases in the proportions of recipient cells may be a prelude to graft rejection or relapse. 
Let sleeping dogs lie: role of the omentum in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. A surgical aphorism has long held that the omentum is the "watchdog of the abdomen." However, detractors believe that leaving the omentum behind after colectomy precipitates later small bowel obstruction. A retrospective comparison was made between a group of 406 patients (Group I) having omentectomy with proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis and a group of 239 patients (Group II) having a similar procedure without omentectomy. Follow-up in this series of 645 patients was 4.3 +/- 2.1 years (mean +/- SEM). No difference was present in the rate of partial small bowel obstruction or complete small bowel obstruction between Group I patients (32 percent partial, 12 percent complete) and Group II patients (29 percent partial, 12 percent complete; P greater than 0.1). However, a better outcome with regard to postoperative sepsis and sepsis requiring operation was apparent in Group II patients retaining the omentum (4 percent and 3 percent, respectively) than in Group I patients (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively), in whom the omentum was removed (P less than 0.01). As this experience would support, we urge surgeons to "let sleeping dogs lie" and, when possible, retain the omentum when performing colectomy or proctocolectomy. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Moderate protection of renal function and reduction of fibrosis by colchicine in a model of anti-GBM disease in the rabbit. A rabbit model of renal glomerulosclerosis induced by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody was used to determine whether colchicine would protect renal function and reduce fibrosis. Initial studies established the time course of renal function changes and fibrosis. Colchicine at a dose of 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg per day injected ip was begun at day 4 when injury had been initiated, and the experiment was ended at day 21 when fibrotic changes were established. Colchicine significantly reduced the rise in serum creatinine (serum creatinine = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg% in vehicle-treated animals versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 mg% in colchicine-treated animals) and interstitial fibrosis (fibrosis score = 2.6 +/- 0.2 in vehicle-treated versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 in colchicine-treated animals). Colchicine treatment did not significantly affect weight, anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin level, % fibrocellular crescents formed, hydroxyproline per gram (dry weight) in tissue, or urine protein: creatine ratio. Regression analysis was performed to examine the interrelationships between variables for all animals and the effect of colchicine on pairs of variables. No clear-cut site of colchicine action could be identified. These data show that colchicine, in doses that could be used in humans, protected renal function by about 25% and reduced interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe crescentic nephritis. 
Diarrheal deaths in the United States, 1979 through 1987. A special problem for the elderly. OBJECTIVE.--Diarrhea is an important cause of death among young children in both developing and developed countries, but little is known about diarrheal death among adults. In this study, we examined trends in diarrheal deaths among all age groups in the United States. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS.--We reviewed national mortality data complied by the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md, which consists of information from all death certificates filed in the United States for the period 1979 through 1987. A death for which diarrhea was listed as an immediate or underlying cause was considered a "diarrheal death" and included in the analysis. RESULTS.--We found that 28,538 persons died of diarrhea cited as either an immediate or the underlying cause of death during the 9-year period. A majority of diarrheal deaths occurred among the elderly (older than 74 years of age, 51%), followed by adults 55 to 74 years of age (27%), and young children (younger than 5 years of age, 11%). For the elderly, adjusted risk factors for dying of diarrhea included being white, female, and residing in a long-term care facility. Only the elderly and young children had clear, distinct winter peaks of diarrheal deaths, suggesting that the diarrhea may, in part, be infectious in origin. CONCLUSION.--For the elderly, more directed studies of those at risk, such as nursing home residents, are needed to determine if oral rehydration therapy, vaccines, or other preventive measures might benefit this population. 
Acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Xamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment. 
Trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an interphase cytogenetic study. Interphase cytogenetics by means of in situ hybridization with the chromosome 12-specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe pSP 12-1 was used for the study of trisomy 12, the most common chromosomal abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal. 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: a 10-year prospective screening study in four kindreds. A total of 80 individuals in 4 kindreds with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) have been subjected to repeated biochemical screening during a 10-yr period with the principal aim being to analyze characteristics of the developing pancreatic lesion. Age at presentation of the MEN 1 trait averaged 18 yr in 7 previously unaffected individuals, and this effect of the screening procedure represented a lowering by almost 2 decades. Pancreatic endocrine involvement was recognized at a mean age of 25 yr and constituted the presenting lesion in a majority of the patients. A standardized meal test and basal values of serum pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, proinsulin, and gastrin were the most efficient markers for the pancreatic lesion and preceded signs of pancreatic tumors upon radiological examinations by a mean of 3.5 yr. A 75% penetrance of the islet cell disease and 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism within the affected individuals equalled the prevalences reported in autopsy studies. Two of the kindreds showed signs of intrafamilial homogeneity with respect to the profile of peptide excess (P less than 0.05) and considerable discrepancy in the malignant potential of the pancreatic lesions. The results of early detection and surgical intervention of the pancreatic tumors in MEN 1 suggested an impact on morbidity, while any effect on the mortality of these individuals remains to be clarified. 
Surgical risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is increasingly recognized as a cause of lobar cerebral hemorrhage in normotensive elderly individuals. Isolated reports have suggested that neurosurgical intervention entails a high risk of precipitated hemorrhage. We identified 16 pathologically confirmed cases of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fourteen of these patients presented with lobar cerebral hemorrhage. Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but we conclude that neurosurgical intervention, particularly evacuation of hematomas, is not associated with major risk of precipitated hemorrhage. 
Ventricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart. Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe. We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection. This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient. 
Catheter-less suprapubic cystolithotomy in children. Bladder stones in children are common in developing countries and the procedure of choice for their removal is suprapubic cystolithotomy. It is standard practice to drain the bladder for a few days post-operatively to prevent urinary leakage. We have observed that, if the bladder is closed meticulously in 2 layers, bladder drainage by means of a catheter is not required. We have analysed 86 children treated by suprapubic cystolithotomy without a catheter. Size of the stones and intra-operative findings were noted and it was found that 85% of the patients had an excellent result; 10% had a satisfactory result and 4.7% were unsatisfactory. The advantages of the procedure and selection of the patients are discussed. 
Deleted HTLV-I provirus in blood and cutaneous lesions of patients with mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides. 
Prostate specific antigen in the management of patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with primary radiation therapy. The records of 143 patients treated at 5 institutions with external beam megavoltage irradiation for localized prostatic cancer were reviewed to evaluate post-treatment changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the context of subsequent events. Complete responders were defined as patients clinically well with normal PSA, clinical failures were patients with documented local tumor recurrence or distant metastases and chemical failures were patients clinically well but with a PSA level above the upper limits of normal. Correlations with pre-treatment PSA values were also made for the 50 of 143 patients for whom pre-treatment PSA data were available. Median patient followup was 27 months (range 18 to 91 months). The data were analyzed with parametric and nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Pre-treatment PSA levels increased with increasing tumor stage (p = 0.004) but not with increasing summed Gleason pattern scores (p = 0.15). The probability of remaining a complete responder decreased with increasing stage (p = 0.008) but not with increasing Gleason score (p = 0.14). Increasing pre-treatment PSA correlated with clinical failure (p = 0.01) and chemical failure (p = 0.006). Of the patients with a pre-treatment PSA level of less than 4 times the upper limits of normal 83% remained as complete responders compared to 30% of those with a higher pre-treatment PSA (p = 0.0002). The return of PSA levels to the normal range within 6 months after treatment was strongly correlated with a favorable outcome when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The status at last followup of patients who had a normal PSA level at 6 months versus those with an elevated PSA level 6 months after treatment is 94% versus 8% for complete responders (p = 0.0001), 0% versus 60% for clinical failures (p = 0.002) and 6% versus 32% for chemical failures (p = 0.14). Similar results occurred when analyzing outcomes in relationship to PSA normalization within 12 months after treatment (p = 0.001 for clinical failures, p = 0.02 for chemical failures and p = 0.001 for complete responders). We conclude that the pre-treatment level of PSA is an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy, and that the failure of PSA to return to the normal range within 1 year after completion of treatment identifies a group of patients at high risk for tumor recurrence. 
Hemodynamic effects of direct angiotensin II blockade compared to converting enzyme inhibition in rat model of heart failure. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to direct blockade of angiotensin II (AII) with DuP 753 in the rat model of heart failure. Rats with chronic heart failure postinfarction were treated for 2 weeks with either captopril (2 g/L, N = 9) in their drinking water or with DuP 753 (40 mg/kg/day for two weeks by gastric gavage, N = 10), or placebo (N = 9). At this dose, DuP 753 shifted the log dose-pressor response curve to AII parallel to the right by two orders of magnitude in both chronically treated normal and heart failure rats. In rats with heart failure, DuP 753 and captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 26.7 +/- 1.5 to 14.2 +/- 3.0 (P less than .01) and 15.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than .05), respectively, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 2.71 +/- 0.10 to 2.03 +/- 0.17 (P less than .05) and 2.18 +/- 0.15 (P less than .05), respectively; venous compliance increased from 2.27 +/- 0.06 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 (P less than .05) and 3.02 +/- 0.21 mL/mm Hg/kg (P less than .01), respectively. There were no significant changes in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, mean aortic pressure, heart rate, or right atrial pressure. There was a trend, but not significant, for a reduction in total blood volume from 65.8 +/- 1.1 to 59.4 +/- 3.0 and 64.9 +/- 3.9 mL/kg, respectively. Thus, direct blockade of AII with DuP 753 or with converting enzyme inhibition with captopril produces similar hemodynamic changes in rats with heart failure after myocardial infarction. 
Preventive maintenance of the aging heart. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of mortality in the elderly. Important risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, systolic and diastolic hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Elderly patients with existing CHD should be treated aggressively to control these risk factors, along with other medical therapies to treat myocardial ischemia. For elderly patients without recognized CHD, however, a more conservative approach is recommended and includes behavioral interventions when appropriate and pharmacologic therapy for higher risk patients with persistent, uncontrolled risk factors. 
Screening in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer will affect 20,000 American women this year and some 13,500 will die of the disease. Most patients will have stage III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Because ovarian cancer may be initially without symptoms, attempts have been made to develop screening tests that would lead to an early diagnosis. Two tests, serum CA 125 and pelvic ultrasonography, have been suggested by some to be accurate enough to be included in yearly screening for ovarian cancer. Although further testing of these techniques is encouraged, data to date do not justify yearly screening with CA 125 or pelvic ultrasonography in all women. 
Indicators of prognosis after hepatic resection for colorectal secondaries. From 1960 to 1988, 266 patients underwent resection of colorectal secondaries to the liver with curative intent. All patients were followed until April 1, 1990, or death, with a median follow-up time of 52 months. Nine patients with minimal macroscopic residual disease and 38 patients with all gross tumor removed but positive margins showed a poor prognosis with a median survival time of 13.3 months, the longest being 42 months. Of the 219 patients having potentially curative resection, 12 patients died postoperatively (5.5%). Actuarial 5, 10 and 20-year survival for the remaining 207 patients was 39%, 28%, and 18%, respectively. At April 1, 1990, 77 patients were alive with no evidence of disease for up to 24 years, and 12 patients had died without recurrence. The following factors were associated with less favorable crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0003), grade III/IV primary tumor (p = 0.035), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.017), satellite metastases (p = 0.0003), limited resection margins (p = 0.019), and nonanatomic procedures (p = 0.013). With respect to disease-free survival, grading of the primary (p = 0.055) and the extent of clear margins (p = 0.019) failed to achieve statistical significance. Two other criteria are commonly recommended as absolute contraindications to hepatic resection: extrahepatic disease and the presence of four or more independent metastases. A radical excision of all detectable disease may rarely be possible in these circumstances. Nevertheless, within the curative settings, no significant predictive value regarding either overall or disease-free survival was found in this series. Three corresponding "high risk" patients are alive without disease at 5 to 11 years from hepatic resection. These patients with more advanced intrahepatic or concomitant limited extrahepatic disease require a particularly thorough diagnostic work up. As no superior therapeutic alternative is currently available, an aggressive surgical approach may occasionally be justified, and may, in a small portion, result in definite tumor control. 
The effect of palliative radiation therapy on epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. The efficacy of palliative radiation therapy in the treatment of spinal cord and cauda equina compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma was evaluated in 38 sites in 35 patients treated between 1970 and 1990. All patients had radiographic documentation of epidural compression. The median dose of radiation therapy was 2850 cGy (range, 500 to 4000 cGy), with daily fractions ranging from 200 to 800 cGy. Twenty-eight sites in 26 patients were evaluable 1 month after completion of radiation therapy, and symptoms responded completely in 11 of 28 (39%) sites. Fourteen sites (46%) showed a partial response of symptoms. Response lasting until death was documented in 21 of 26 patients (81%). Patients receiving a total dose of 3000 cGy or greater were more likely to achieve a complete response than those receiving less than 3000 cGy (62% versus 20%) by univariate (P = 0.025) and multivariate (P = 0.048) analyses. A treatment program of radiation therapy and corticosteroids is effective in palliating the symptoms of epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. It is recommended to deliver an accelerated course of radiation therapy to a dose of 3000 cGy or greater without exceeding spinal cord tolerance (e.g., 3000 cGy in ten fractions at 300 cGy per fraction). 
Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique. Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management. If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision. The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma. 
Thermal ablation of the gallbladder. Gallbladder ablation by means of injection of hot contrast medium was attempted in 13 dogs. Room temperature contrast medium was injected into the gallbladders of two additional dogs (controls). After midline laparotomy was performed to expose the gallbladder, temperature probes were placed in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, and on the surface and in the lumen of the gallbladder. A 7-F catheter with multiple side holes was placed into the gallbladder. The cystic duct was clamped during the procedure. After injection of boiling contrast medium, the mean temperature in the gallbladder lumen was 80 degrees C; in the adjacent liver, 43.5 degrees C; and on the gallbladder surface, 45.8 degrees C. After the procedure, the cystic duct was unclamped, temperature probes and catheter were removed, and the laparotomy was closed in standard fashion. In the hot contrast medium group, one dog each was sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at 6 months. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 year. The gallbladder was completely ablated in 11 of 13 animals in the hot contrast medium group. One dog was sacrificed at 8 days because of bile leakage, and another was sacrificed at 17 days because of gallbladder rupture. The two control animals were sacrificed at 12 and 13 weeks, and their gallbladders were normal at that time. 
A study guided by the Health Belief Model of the predictors of breast cancer screening of women ages 40 and older. In late 1987, a total of 852 Rhode Island women ages 40 and older were interviewed by telephone (78 percent response rate) to measure their use of breast cancer screening and to investigate potential predictors of use. Predictors included the women's socioeconomic status, use of medical care, a provider's reported recommendations for screening, and the women's health beliefs about breast cancer and mammography. The Health Belief Model guided the construction of the interview questions and data analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify leading independent predictors of breast cancer screening according to contemporary recommendations: reporting that a medical provider had ever recommended a screening mammogram (odds ratio [OR] = 18.77), having received gynecological care in the previous year (OR = 4.92), having a regular source of gynecological care (OR = 2.63), having ever had a diagnostic mammogram (OR = 2.32), and perceiving mammography as safe enough to have annually (OR = 1.93). The findings suggest that programs intended to increase the use of breast cancer screening should include "inreach" and "outreach" elements; inreach to patients with established patient-provider relationships, by assuring that physicians recommend screening to all eligible patients, and outreach to all eligible women, by helping them overcome barriers to effective primary care, and by promoting mammography, emphasizing its effectiveness and safety. The findings also suggest that socioeconomically disadvantaged women, who are less likely to be screened than other women, should become special targets of inreach and outreach interventions. 
Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children. To determine the effectiveness of percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts, we reviewed the courses of 13 children. Six pseudocysts resolved on complete bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition. Seven required further therapy. Two pseudocysts were treated operatively; five were drained percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance. These five ranged from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and were present for 10 to 42 days (mean, 26 days). In all cases, the cyst fluid was clear, had an amylase level of greater than 40,000 IU/L, and grew no organisms. The pigtail catheters left in place in four of the five children were removed when drainage stopped. Patients were followed by ultrasound while still in the hospital and 1 month after discharge. There were no complications nor any pseudocyst recurrence. Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children is an effective alternative to the standard operative therapy of pseudocystenteric anastomosis. 
A placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter: a multicenter study. The safety and efficacy of a 10- to 15-mg/h continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem were evaluated in 47 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who first responded to 20 mg or 20 mg followed by one or more 25-mg bolus doses of open label intravenous diltiazem. Of the 47 patients, 44 responded to the bolus injection and were randomized under double-blind conditions to receive either a continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem (10 to 15 mg/h) (23 patients) or placebo (21 patients) for up to 24 h. Seventeen (74%) of the 23 patients receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 h (p less than 0.001). Over 24 h, patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response significantly more slowly than did those receiving placebo infusion (p less than 0.001). Nonresponders to the double-blind infusion were given an additional bolus injection of open label intravenous diltiazem and administered an open label 24-h intravenous diltiazem infusion. The overall proportion of patients maintaining a response to a 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem under double-blind or open label conditions combined was 83% (34 of 41). Efficacy of the 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem was similar in elderly versus young patients, those who did versus those who did not receive digoxin and those weighing less than 84 versus greater than or equal to 84 kg. However, intravenous diltiazem appeared to be more effective in atrial fibrillation than in atrial flutter. No significant untoward effects were noted. 
Histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In summary, histamine initiates acid secretion by stimulating the H2 subtype histamine receptor on parietal cells. Cimetidine, rantidine, famotidine, and nizantidine are histamine H2-receptor antagonists that block this action of histamine, reducing gastric acid output and concentration under both basal and stimulated conditions. These agents are used for treatment and prevention of peptic and stress ulcers as well as for hypersecretory states. Because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects, H2-antagonists have largely replaced more traditional antiulcer regimens. 
Seizures caused by nontraumatic parenchymal brain hemorrhages. Seizures occurred in 15% of patients with parenchymal brain hemorrhage (early in 12% and delayed in 3%). Seizures were most frequent with lobar hemorrhages and uncommon with deep subcortical hemorrhages. Lobar hemorrhages in the frontal, parietal, or temporal region were more commonly associated with seizures, whereas occipital hemorrhages were not. Seizures were most common if the hemorrhage was due to an aneurysm, angioma, or neoplasm and less common if hypertensive or spontaneous. If the patient had recurrent seizures or developed delayed seizures, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to a hypodense appearance; if the seizure did not recur, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to an isodense appearance. 
Patent ductus arteriosus in an infant with atrioventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension: diagnosis by transesophageal color flow echocardiography. An infant with complete atrioventricular septal defect (atrioventricular canal) was examined by standard transthoracic two-dimensional pulsed Doppler and color Doppler echocardiography. No evidence of ductus arteriosus was present. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography identified a patent ductus: the left-to-right shunt seen by color Doppler echocardiography was enhanced by pharmacologic maneuvers aimed at decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and increasing systemic vascular resistance. Transesophageal echocardiography was found to be more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography even in a small infant. 
Using ADLs to establish eligibility for long-term care among the cognitively impaired. Using a database from the Oregon Medicaid program, we examined the differences in the potential insurance coverage of demented persons by using different formulations of ADL (activities of daily living) dependencies in which the definition of dependency did or did not include the need for supervision. For those with clear dementia, 81-88% of the persons with significant behavioral problems were correctly identified when a cut score of three or more ADLs was used; this percentage was even higher for two or more ADLs. This approach was not as effective in correctly discriminating those who had no behavioral problems. 
Neuropathy, myopathy and destructive arthropathy in primary hypothyroidism. A 75-year-old woman with untreated primary hypothyroidism was found with peripheral neuropathy (including carpal tunnel syndrome), severe myopathy (high levels of creatine phosphokinase) and destructive arthropathy, affecting fingers, toes and the left knee. Radiographs of her knee showed destructive lesions of the tibial plateau similar to a pathologic compression fracture, while the joints of the fingers and toes showed all signs of severe erosive osteoarthritis (OA), radiographically documented over a period of 7 years. It is suggested that hypothyroidism is causally related to the development of erosive OA. 
Autoimmune aetiology for acquired neuromyotonia (Isaacs' syndrome). Neuromyotonia is a rare disorder of unknown cause in which hyperexcitability of peripheral motor nerves leads to incapacitating muscle twitching, cramps, and weakness. We investigated an antibody-mediated mechanism for neuromyotonia in a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of severe disease unresponsive to pharmacological treatment. Two periods of plasma exchange each produced almost complete disappearance of symptoms for 2-3 weeks, and a highly significant decrease in recorded neuromyotonic discharges. Injection of the patient's plasma or purified IgG into mice significantly enhanced in-vitro resistance to d-tubocurarine at the neuromuscular junction of phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. This finding suggests that an increase in neurotransmitter release might result from an antibody-mediated reduction in the number of functional potassium channels that normally regulate nerve excitability. The demonstration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies in acquired neuromyotonia suggests that immunosuppressive treatment may be helpful in severe cases. 
Use of a marshmallow bolus for evaluating lower esophageal mucosal rings. Sixty-three patients (35 women, 28 men; mean age 55 yr) with lower esophageal mucosal ring shown radiographically were examined with a semi-solid bolus consisting of a portion of a standard marshmallow. The most common symptom was dysphagia, present in 46 (73%) patients. Impaction of the marshmallow bolus by the ring occurred in 40 (63%) of the 63 patients, and produced symptoms in 27 (68%) of these 40 patients. Nine (14%) rings were detected radiographically only with a solid bolus; eight of these patients had dysphagia and seven rings were 20 mm or less in caliber. Impaction related to ring caliber, and was found in all 17 (100%) rings that were 13 mm or less in diameter, in 17/24 (71%) 14- to 19-mm rings, and in 6/22 (27%) rings 20 mm or more in caliber. Endoscopy in 23 patients detected 16 (70%) rings, and also depended on ring caliber: less than or equal to 13 mm, 6/6 (100%); 14-19 mm, 5/9 (56%); greater than or equal to 20 mm, 5/8 (63%). Marshmallow impaction occurred in 17 (74%) of 23 patients who had endoscopy; three of the 23 patients had normal endoscopy. In conclusion, radiographic examination supplemented by the use of a marshmallow bolus best detects lower esophageal mucosal ring. 
Blindness as an ictal phenomenon: investigations with EEG and SPECT in two patients suffering from epilepsy. Blindness is a rare ictal phenomenon in epileptic seizures. It can occur as an aura, as the seizure itself, or postictally. We investigated two such patients, in one of whom blindness manifested as an aura prior to tonic clonic seizures; the interictal EEG exhibited a spike-wave focus bioccipitally. In the second patient blindness occurred postictally. An ictal SPECT, carried out at the onset of the seizure demonstrated marked hyperperfusion in both occipital regions. 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma: CT manifestations in 50 cases. Malignant pleural mesothelioma, a rare and usually fatal neoplasm that is associated with asbestos exposure, is being encountered with increasing frequency. Pretreatment CT findings from 50 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma are illustrated. Pleural thickening was found in 46 (92%) of the 50 patients, thickening of the pleural surfaces of the interlobar fissures in 43 (86%), pleural calcifications in 10 (20%), and pleural effusions in 37 (74%). The volume of the involved hemithorax varied appreciably. Contractions of the involved hemithorax was noted in 21 (42%) of 50 patients and contralateral mediastinal shift in seven (14%). Disease beyond the parietal pleura was found in the chest wall (nine patients), mediastinum, lymph nodes, and diaphragm. 
Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor of the prostate. A case report with immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, and DNA flow cytometric analysis. A 22-year-old man presented with symptoms of urinary obstruction and was found to have a 5-cm mass protruding from the left side of the prostate into the prostatic urethra. The lesion was partially removed by transurethral resection (TURP). The patient's symptoms recurred, so he required another TURP four months later; at latest follow-up (four years later), there waas no evidence of disease. Light microscopy revealed a myxoid lesion characterized by an atypical fibroblastic proliferation associated with a prominent inflammatory component and granulation tissue-type vasculature. The lesion nearly replaced the prostatic parenchyma and invaded the bladder wall. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed a predominance of fibroblasts with occasional myofibroblasts. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed that the tumor cells had a diploid DNA content. Given these findings and the indolent clinical course, the authors think that this lesion represents a benign, reactive process consistent with a pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor, a recently described rare lesion of the genitourinary tract. 
Characterization of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in body fluids by immunoblot analysis. We characterized the molecular species of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF) found in serum and urine, using immunoblot analysis after partial purification on an antibody-bound affinity column. Although antibodies were prepared using the recombinant product of the large form of hM-CSF with a molecular weight (MW) of 85 Kd as the antigen, this immunoblot system was also capable of detecting the small form of hM-CSF with a MW of 40 to 60 Kd. A single band with a MW of 43 Kd, which reacted with anti-recombinant hM-CSF IgG but not with control IgG, was found when serum and urine from normal adults underwent electrophoresis on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and subsequent immunoblotting. This band represented a subunit of the large form of hM-CSF, because the large form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 43 Kd and the small form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 20 to 30 Kd. Analysis of serum and urine from leukemic patients and pregnant women, who had higher serum levels of hM-CSF than normal adults, showed only a single band with a MW of 43 Kd as a hM-CSF-specific molecule. These results suggest that the large form of hM-CSF is the major species in human body fluids. 
Positive direct antiglobulin tests in myeloma patients. Occurrence, characterization, and significance. Review of direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) in 88 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and five with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia revealed 26 cases with a positive DAT. Twenty-two of these had immunoglobulin G-M protein, three had light chain MM, and one had immunoglobulin A-MM protein. None of the immunoglobulin GD-MM (n = 2), nonsecretory MM (n = 5), or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients (n = 5) were positive. None of the patients had hemolysis attributable to the adsorption of the M protein. The serum concentration of M protein was higher in DAT-positive patients (57.6 +/- 3.8 g/L, mean +/- SEM) than in the negative ones (35.7 +/- 6.4 g/L; probability value of the difference was less than 0.01). The erythrocyte eluates from DAT-positive patients contained a single immunoglobulin, of the same class as the M protein, and did not react with a panel of ABO-compatible erythrocytes. Addition of melphalan during incubation did not affect the results. The M protein of DAT-positive patients was of immunoglobulin G-3 subclass in 7 of 10 patients. A positive direct antiglobulin test frequently is seen in patients with multiple myeloma, the reaction is due to passive adsorption of the M protein onto the erythrocytes, is most frequently observed with immunoglobulin G3-MM, and usually does not produce hemolysis. 
The importance of surface immunoglobulin, mouse rosettes, and CD5 in the immunophenotyping of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reactive lymphocytosis. Peripheral blood from 167 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 119 reactive lymphocytosis (RLC) patients were analyzed to evaluate the immunophenotypic diagnostic value of mouse rosettes (M-rosette), and weak expression of monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (SIg). In B-CLL, 145 cases were M-rosette+ (86.83%), 135 surface immunoglobulin (SIg)+ (80.84%), and 117 M-rosette+ SIg+ (70.06%). Of 32 SIg- cases, 28 were M-rosette+; and of 22 M-rosette-cases, 18 were SIg+. By combining results of the two assays and accepting positivity of either one or both as sufficient for diagnosis, B-CLL was diagnosed in 163 cases (97.60%). CD5 was performed in 49 cases of the 167 with paired data for SIg and M-rosettes. By combining the results of the three assays and accepting positivity of any two or all three as sufficient for diagnosis, all 49 cases (100%) were diagnosed. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between M-rosette, SIg, and CD5 expression. The results demonstrate the independent expression of the three markers, and their complementary role in immunophenotyping B-CLL. In RLC, all 119 cases were T-lineage and SIg-, and 115 were M-rosette-, indicating the role of the two markers in differentiating B-CLL from RLC. Three of the four M-rosette+ T-RLC were subsequently diagnosed as B-CLL, suggesting the necessity of follow-up of such cases. 
Class II-restricted presentation of an endogenously derived immunodominant T-cell determinant of hen egg lysozyme. An in vitro model was used to investigate the potential for different structural forms of endogenous antigen to be processed and presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. For this purpose the class II-restricted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme [HEL-(46-61)] was studied in class II-positive B-lymphoma cells (M12.C3) transfected with genes encoding HEL molecules either (i) secreted in high (hi) or low (lo) amounts as soluble antigen [sHEL(hi/lo)], (ii) localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/salvage compartment (ER-HEL), or (iii) anchored on the cell surface as an integral membrane protein (mHEL). The corresponding sHEL, ER-HEL, and mHEL gene products were expressed as predicted except that HEL determinants accumulated in the culture supernatant as well as on the cell membrane of mHEL-transfected cells. Class II-positive cells endogenously expressing all three forms of HEL antigen constitutively presented the immunodominant HEL-(46-61) determinant with differential efficiency (mHEL, sHEL greater than ERHEL) to a class II-restricted T hybridoma. A second T hybridoma recognized endogenous HEL-(46-61) determinants constitutively presented on sHEL(hi) and mHEL transfectants but not on sHEL(lo) or ERHEL transfectants. The formation of HEL-(46-61)/I-Ak complexes in the ERHEL and sHEL(lo) transfectants was therefore limiting. Mixing experiments with different antigen-presenting cells indicated that the HEL-(46-61) determinant was derived from endogenous antigen rather than by reuptake of shed or secreted HEL determinants. We conclude that MHC class II molecules can present some antigenic determinants derived from endogenous proteins that are sequestered in the ER/salvage compartment as well as distally transported in the form of secretory or membrane antigens. 
Thoracoscopic diagnosis and treatment of chylothorax after pneumonectomy. Chylothorax after pneumonectomy was treated successfully by selective application of fibrin glue through a thoracoscope. Conservative therapy for 18 days failed to close the fistula. The site of leakage was identified during thoracoscopy, and fibrin glue was applied under direct vision. Leakage decreased immediately and eventually stopped completely. This technique is less invasive than standard surgical treatment and should be considered in all patients with postoperative chylothorax. 
Strategy for management of distal ileal Crohn's disease. We have determined the outcome of a defined policy for the management of distal ileal Crohn's disease using a prospective computer-based analysis of 139 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1988 with a mean follow-up of 10 years. The policy in outline consists of conservative treatment for acute obstructive episodes, resection or strictureplasty for recurrent obstructive episodes, surgical treatment for abscess and fistula formation and specific medical treatment (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy or metronidazole) for symptomatic non-obstructive disease. Twenty-nine patients had a benign course without resection. The remainder were treated surgically at some time but only 28 of these patients had specific treatment before operation. Thirty-three needed more than one resection and five needed more than three surgical procedures. Immediate, early or delayed surgical treatment did not affect the reoperation rates or the long-term outcome. Eleven patients died, ten of causes unrelated to Crohn's disease. Of the 128 living patients, 114 are fit and well, and only two are currently taking specific medication. Fourteen are unwell of whom six either need or have refused further surgery which could restore them to good health. This management policy has achieved excellent long-term results in nearly all patients, and our findings suggest that the timing of surgery and its nature are more important in determining outcome than specific medical therapy. 
The modified buccal musculomucosal flap method for cleft palate surgery. We have reported previously on a palatoplasty method, called the T-shaped musculomucosal buccal flap method, for the primary repair of a cleft palate. This method has been used on more than 90 patients, and satisfactory outcomes have resulted in terms of maxillar development, the prevention of fistulation, and verbal functions. However, 14.3 percent of these patients exhibited a velopharyngeal incompetence that showed no potential improvement through training. In the majority of these patients, the entire raw surface of the oral cavity side could not be covered with a buccal musculomucosal flap, and as a result, postoperative contraction of the soft palate occurred. Thus a new surgical method has proven effective in which both buccal musculomucosal flaps are used as an oral lining, the nasal mucosa having been extended by Z-plasty. We have performed 25 operations using this new method and have observed no postoperative contractions of the soft palate, notwithstanding two cases (8.0 percent) of postoperative fistulation. 
Comparative studies of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy by Dornier HM3, EDAP LT 01 and Sonolith 2000 devices. During a 2-year period extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was done at our institution in 70 patients with the Dornier HM3, 113 with the EDAP LT 01 and 104 with the Sonolith 2000 lithotriptors. The size and location of stones were comparable in all 3 series, and all treatments were done by the same team of urologists. Complete fragmentation occurred in 79% of the patients treated by the Dornier, 82% treated by the EDAP and 79% treated by the Sonolith devices, with 3-month stone-free rates of 66, 67 and 58%, respectively. Auxiliary procedures were needed in 12% of the patients in the Dornier, 13% in the EDAP and 9% in the Sonolith groups. Repeat treatment was necessary in 4% of the Dornier group, 42% of the EDAP group and 26% of the Sonolith group. Therefore, all 3 lithotriptors are effective in stone disintegration and produce satisfactory results when selection criteria for ESWL are observed. The most significant difference among the 3 lithotriptors is the number of repeat treatments, which reflects the power and energy output of the lithotriptors. In conclusion, the Dornier HM3 device has the advantage of low repeat treatment rate and easier stone localization. The EDAP LT 01 unit has the advantage of lower treatment costs and anesthesia-free treatment with no irradiation. The Sonolith 2000 device has features of the other 2 lithotriptors with a superior ultrasound image. 
A systematic consideration of the neoplastic spectrum of AIDS: registry linkage in Illinois. To examine unexplored aspects of the association between AIDS and neoplasia, the Illinois AIDS and Cancer Registries were linked. The method integrated use of a personal computer to find exact matches on names and dates of birth with manual review to assure satisfaction of a match definition. Of the factors examined, white race and homosexuality predicted Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) among people with AIDS (PWAs), and white race predicted non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Earlier reports of a declining proportion of PWAs with KS were confirmed. Lymphoma (mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic type), while not currently diagnostic of AIDS, occurred more frequently among PWAs than in the Illinois population. For the first time, rates of cancers other than KS and NHL were demonstrated to be significantly increased among PWAs compared with general populations. In the light of these findings, reconsideration of current neoplastic definitions may be useful. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy of childhood: treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. We treated four children with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). All patients received 400 mg/kg of IVIG a day for 5 days during relapses, and one patient received additional periodic infusions of 400 mg/kg. All patients showed excellent recovery of motor strength following each relapse that was treated with IVIG. Compared with plasmapheresis (which was used to treat relapses earlier), recovery of function with IVIG treatments was similar, and in two patients it was superior, to plasmapheresis. There were no side effects with IVIG treatments as compared with plasmapheresis with which two children had infection of central lines with Staphylococcus epidermidis, one had profuse bleeding from accidental extrusion of a central line, and one had multiple episodes of major venous thromboses. High-dose IVIG was a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for childhood CIDP in these four patients. 
Experience with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty and a rotary angioplasty instrument: lessons learned. Favorable early results with mechanical angioplasty devices and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty have resulted in aggressive marketing and a rapid increase in the use of these devices for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Passive immunoprophylaxis after liver transplantation in HBsAg-positive patients. 110 HBsAg-positive patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and received long-term anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) passive immunoprophylaxis with anti-HBs immunoglobulin. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft. Long-term passive anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis significantly reduced HBV reinfection and improved survival in patients without evidence of active HBV replication before orthotopic liver transplantation. 
Differential activation within costal diaphragm during rapid-eye-movement sleep in cats. Simultaneous recordings of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) were made from two separate regions of the costal diaphragm in six normal cats. The diaphragmatic activities were always synchronous and the amplitudes and rates of rise were similar during slow-wave sleep. In contrast, during natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, different activity was often present in the two leads. These differences were in the time of onset and offset, as well as in the amplitude and spike patterns, and occurred in approximately 5-20% of the diaphragmatic bursts averaged over the entire REM sleep period. With respect to eye movement density, the rate of differential activation was higher during periods of high density (26%) than in the absence of eye movements (1%) in the four animals for which these data were available. Differential activation of portions of the costal diaphragm is apparently a normal event of REM sleep. This could result from descending state-specific phasic neuronal activity that bypasses the medullary respiratory generator. Differential activation of portions of the diaphragm could contribute to disordered ventilation during REM sleep. 
Posttraumatic headache and the postconcussion syndrome. Although headache is the most common sequelae of head injury, the posttraumatic headache is associated frequently with dizziness, irritability, lack of concentration, and intolerance to alcohol ingestion as a part of a symptom complex known as the postconcussion syndrome. This article clarifies the definitions of acute traumatic headache, posttraumatic headache, and the postconcussion syndrome and improves diagnostic ability, making the assessment and treatment of patients with these three conditions more accurate and effective. 
Characterization of interactions of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O127:H6 with mammalian cells in vitro. Previous studies have identified two bacterial factors involved in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection. A plasmid-mediated EPEC adherence factor (EAF) is responsible for initial and localized adherence. A chromosomally encoded E. coli attachment and effacement factor (eae) is involved in effacement of the eukaryotic cell surface and characteristic "pedestal" formation. By using isogenic strains deficient in either EAF, eae, or both, the process of EPEC adherence and entry in vitro was examined. While EAF proved necessary and sufficient for efficient bacterial association with HEp-2 cells, both EAF and eae were required for efficient effacement of and entry into these cells and other cultured cell lines. Invasion mediated by eae was markedly inhibited by cytochalasin D and colchicine. Afimbrial adhesion or type I pili from uropathogenic strains of E. coli substituted for EAF in EAF-Eae+ strains to provide initial adherence to HEp-2 cells and to facilitate actin condensation. 
Who will operate on Africa's 3 million curably blind people? About half the 6 million blind people in sub-Saharan Africa have surgically curable cataract. The available manpower and resources can only provide services for less than 10% of the new blind cataract patients each year, and little is being done for the estimated 3 million "cataract backlog". A serious limiting factor to the development of prevention of blindness programmes is lack of trained manpower. Despite an increase in the number of ophthalmologists trained in cataract surgery (which varies greatly from country to country), this number is not keeping pace with increased demand for eye-care services, especially in large rural populations. Initiatives that will help to overcome this dilemma are specific post-graduate courses in community ophthalmology in Africa, plans to develop a one-year diploma in ophthalmology course for English-speaking West African countries, and a proposal to upgrade a similar course in Zimbabwe. Additionally there is a need for the training of more ophthalmic assistants, cataract surgeons, and nurses in the diagnosis and management of common ophthalmic disorders. Experienced expatriate ophthalmologists also have an important role in the teaching of doctors and ophthalmic assistants how to select patients and carry out successful inexpensive cataract surgery with appropriate technology and limited facilities. 
Ectopic pituitary adenoma in the suprasellar cistern: case report. The case of a 56-year-old man with an ectopic pituitary adenoma is reported. Neurological examinations, neurodiagnostic imaging, surgical observation, endocrinological evaluation, histological examination, and immunohistological study demonstrated evidence of ectopic prolactinoma in the suprasellar cistern and the presence of a normal pituitary in the sella turcica. The patient underwent total removal of the suprasellar mass by a pterional approach, leading to a surgical and endocrinological cure. 
Two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy. We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations. Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody. These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months. 
Treatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate. Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A). Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B). Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses. Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions. Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B. There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications. We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant. 
Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the gasserian ganglion associated with neurofibromatosis. A case of primary intracranial malignant melanoma of the left gasserian ganglion associated with temporal lobe gliosis in a patient suffering from von Recklinghausen's disease is reported. The association of primary malignant melanoma of the trigeminal nerve and neurofibromatosis is discussed. 
Lymph node counts in the upper abdomen: anatomical basis for lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer. The number of regional lymph nodes was determined in sites relevant to lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer in 30 cadavers. Tissue was cleared by dissolving fatty tissue, thus making lymph nodes with a diameter of at least 1 mm visible. All lymph node stations indicated by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer were studied. In stations 1-11 (corresponding with R2 resection) an average of 27 nodes (range 17-44 nodes) was found, whereas stations 1-16 (corresponding with R3 resection) showed an average of 43 nodes (range 25-64 nodes). These values are higher than those usually obtained from lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Striking individual differences in the total number of lymph nodes and the number of single stations was observed. The number of lymph nodes in these investigations are the normal anatomical values and serve as quality control of lymph node dissection in gastric carcinoma. 
Gamma-interferon promotes proliferation of adult human astrocytes in vitro and reactive gliosis in the adult mouse brain in vivo. Reactive gliosis is a characteristic response of astrocytes to inflammation and trauma of the central nervous system. To investigate whether soluble factors (cytokines) from inflammatory mononuclear cells that accumulate at lesion sites can provide the cellular signals to initiate gliosis and to identify such cytokines, we have tested and found that supernatants derived from subsets of activated human T lymphocytes (CD8+ or CD4+) are potent mitogens for cultured human adult astrocytes. This effect is blocked by a neutralizing antibody to gamma-interferon (IFN). Recombinant IFN alone can induce proliferation of human adult astrocytes in vitro and increase the extent of trauma-initiated gliosis in the adult mouse brain. The astrocyte proliferation-inducing activity of supernatants of glial cultures treated with IFN can be completely blocked with IFN-neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the proliferative effect does not require intermediary cytokines or cells. These results implicate IFN as an important mediator of the gliosis observed in pathologic conditions of the adult central nervous system associated with infiltrating lymphocytes. 
Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis with postoperative enteral feedings by needle catheter jejunostomy: an unusual complication. We evaluated the incidence of clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis and intestinal necrosis with the use of needle catheter jejunostomy in 217 consecutive patients who had undergone complicated abdominal operations or selected bariatric procedures. The needle catheter jejunostomy was used to deliver immediate postoperative nutrition, maintenance, and replacement fluids, and selected medications. In this group, no serious complications requiring surgical intervention were related to the use of needle catheter jejunostomies. Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis was encountered in two of 217 patients (1%). With the needle catheter jejunostomy in place, both patients improved rapidly when enteral feedings were discontinued and parenteral antibiotics were administered. None of the 217 patients developed ischemic intestinal necrosis. We conclude that 1) clinically significant pneumatosis is a rare complication of enteric feeding via needle catheter jejunostomy when the intrajejunal feeding is begun with a diluted, hypoosmolar solution with stepwise increases in osmolality, and 2) patients who do develop clinically significant pneumatosis (n = 2) seem to respond rapidly to a temporary stoppage of enteral feedings and administration of parenteral antibiotics. 
Facial nerve and medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatomas. Eight patients with extensive petrous bone cholesteatomas that invaded the labyrinth and fallopian canal are presented. The eight cases are added to a tabulation of prior literature reports to elucidate concepts of routes of extension of medially invasive temporal bone cholesteatoma. Medially invasive petrous bone cholesteatoma develops insidiously, often without symptoms other than facial palsy and/or unilateral deafness. Typically, a history of chronic ear disease can be obtained. While hearing is unlikely to be preserved in this group of patients, facial nerve function can usually be preserved, and a facial nerve graft was not necessary in our series. Acute facial nerve palsy or facial nerve paresis progressing to palsy in patients with a history of chronic ear disease should be studied radiographically for petrous bone cholesteatoma, even if there is no physical evidence of cholesteatoma. 
Controlled trial of 2, 4, and 6 months of pyrazinamide in 6-month, three-times-weekly regimens for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, including an assessment of a combined preparation of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Results at 30 months. Hong Kong Chest Service/British Medical Research Council In a study in Hong Kong 1,386 Chinese patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated at random to four 6-month regimens of chemotherapy, all given three times weekly from the start and all containing isoniazid (H) and rifampin (R) throughout. Three contained streptomycin (S) for the first 4 months and pyrazinamide (Z) for 2 months (Z2), 4 months (Z4), or 6 months (Z6); the fourth contained pyrazinamide for 6 months but no streptomycin (Z6noS). Every dose of all four regimens was given under the direct supervision of clinic staff on a predominantly outpatient basis. During the later part of the intake patients were allocated at random to be given their HRZ either as a combined formulation (Rifater), each tablet containing 125 mg isoniazid, 100 mg rifampin, and 375 mg pyrazinamide, or as the three drugs separately. Among 892 assessable patients with drug-susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli pretreatment, bacteriologic failure during chemotherapy occurred in 4, all Z6noS (2% of 224; p less than 0.005 for the comparison with the S-containing regimens). During 30 months of follow-up after the end of chemotherapy, bacteriologic relapse occurred in 2 (3%) of 71 Z2, 2 (3%) of 72 Z4, 4 (6%) of 66 Z6, and 6 (9%) of 64 Z6noS patients allocated to Rifater, and in 4 (3%) of 149 Z2, 8 (6%) of 133 Z4, 2 (1%) of 142 Z6, and 6 (4%) of 135 Z6noS patients allocated to separate drugs. In the relapse rates there were no significant differences between the Rifater and separate drug regimens, the different durations of pyrazinamide, or the regimens with and without streptomycin. 
Failure of initial 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring to predict refractoriness and intractability in reflux esophagitis. Prolonged esophageal pH monitoring is considered to be the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the role of pH monitoring in predicting the clinical and endoscopic response of reflux esophagitis is not well defined. In this study, 106 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of GERD and esophagitis (grades 0-IV) by endoscopy were initially studied by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring, and their clinical response to standard H2 antagonist therapy was monitored at 8 wk. Refractory patients were defined as those who failed to heal and/or had intractable reflux symptoms after 8 wk of H2 antagonist therapy, and who required continuous therapy with higher doses of H2 antagonists, addition of prokinetic agents, or omeprazole. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89) between endoscopic severity of esophagitis upon entry into the study and refractoriness to standard medical therapy. However, there were no differences in the various pH parameters analyzed between the 58 patients who responded and the 48 patients who were refractory to medical therapy, regardless of the endoscopic grading of their esophagitis. We conclude that 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring does not predict refractoriness of reflux esophagitis to standard therapy. The decision for more aggressive methods of treatment probably requires assessment of symptomatic and endoscopic response after 8 week standard H2 antagonist therapy. 
Ultrastructural morphometry of gastric endocrine cells before and after omeprazole. A study in the oxyntic mucosa of duodenal ulcer patients. Long-term toxicological experiments with inhibitors of acid secretion were found to induce hyperplasia and eventually carcinoid tumors of the enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa. To evaluate the effects of 6 months' treatment with omeprazole in humans, the oxyntic endocrine cells were morphometrically investigated at the ultrastructural level in five patients with active duodenal ulcer. No omeprazole-induced changes were found in the volume density of the total endocrine cell population and specific cell types (including the enterochromaffin-like cell) as well as in the other cytological parameters investigated (number of cell profiles per unit area, mean cross-sectional area of cell profiles, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and density of cytoplasmic secretory granules). Both pretreatment and post-treatment values in our patients with duodenal ulcer significantly differed from those of a previous investigation of healthy volunteers with regard to the volume density of enterochromaffin-like cells and non-granulated cells, which increased, and of D cells, which markedly decreased. The latter result may provide a cellular basis for impairment in the paracrine release of fundic somatostatin in peptic ulcer disease. Finally, morphometric data on endocrine cell volume density provided by electron microscopy were found to correlate with those obtained in the same patients using light microscopy techniques (Grimelius silver impregnation and chromogranin A immunostaining). It is concluded that 6 months' treatment with pharmacological doses of omeprazole is devoid of appreciable trophic effect on endocrine cells of human oxyntic mucosa. 
Fate of patients with acute myocardial infarction with patency of the infarct-related vessel achieved with successful thrombolysis versus rescue angioplasty. Patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy have a poor clinical outcome. These patients have been considered for rescue angioplasty 90 min after thrombolytic therapy at the time of emergency catheterization in the course of five Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials. The outcome of 776 patients with patent infarct-related vessels after emergency catheterization was analyzed--607 with thrombolysis-mediated patency of the infarct-related vessel and 169 with patency achieved by angioplasty. Baseline characteristics of the thrombolysis and angioplasty patency groups were similar except for a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (51.3% versus 48.2%) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.003). Seven to 10 day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (52.3% versus 48.1%), infarct zone functional recovery was greater (0.44 versus 0.21 standard deviation/chord, or 18% versus 7%, p = 0.001) and reocclusion was less (11% versus 21%) in the thrombolysis compared with the angioplasty group. Despite these differences, angioplasty patency was associated with the same low in-hospital mortality rate (5.9% versus 4.6%) and long-term mortality rate (3% versus 2%) as thrombolysis patency. Reocclusion adversely affected the mortality rate and ventricular functional recovery. Technical failure of rescue angioplasty was associated with a much higher mortality rate than was technical success (39.1% versus 5.9%). Thrombolysis patency was preferable to angioplasty patency after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but both were associated with the same low in-hospital and long-term mortality rates, suggesting that rescue angioplasty is beneficial in some patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy. 
Exploring the molecular basis for variability among patients with Becker muscular dystrophy: dystrophin gene and protein studies. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) often results from in-frame mutations of the dystrophin gene that allow production of an altered but partially functional protein. To address potential structure-function relationships for the various domains of dystrophin, we examined both the dystrophin gene and protein in 68 patients with abnormal dystrophin. Eighty-six percent of BMD patients with dystrophin of altered size have deletions or duplications, and the observed sizes of dystrophin fit well with predictions based on DNA data. Deletions within the amino-terminal domain I tended to result in low levels of dystrophin and a more severe phenotype. The phenotypes of patients with deletions or duplications in the central rod domain were more variable. This region can be divided into three portions based on differences in clinical presentations of patients. Deletions around exons 4553 were most common and generally caused typical BMD; however, phenotypic variability among patients with similar mutations suggests that epigenetic and/or environmental factors play an important role in determining the clinical progression. In contrast, deletions or duplications in the proximal portion of this domain tended to cause severe cramps and myalgia. Finally, loss of the middle of this region probably causes a very mild phenotype, as only one such patient was found and his only symptom was elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels. 
Anterior urethral polyp associated with hematuria in six-year-old child. Anterior urethral polyps are rare, occur only in male patients, and have been associated with obstruction, terminal hematuria, and enuresis. We believe this is the fifth reported case of anterior urethral polyp associated with terminal hematuria. The radiographic findings, treatment, and pathology are reviewed. 
Percutaneous stimulation of the cauda equina. A new diagnostic method in spinal stenosis. A study to determine the feasibility of measurement of conduction velocities through the lumbosacral nerve roots by direct percutaneous stimulation of the cauda equina is reported. The technique was applied to a series of normal volunteers and its reliability and reproducibility confirmed. An electrophysiologic defect was demonstrated in most patients with surgically proven lateral recess stenosis. Electrophysiologic recovery was shown in patients examined after surgery. Although the technique can be refined, these early results are encouraging. 
Reducing the risk of stroke: identifying patients to refer for carotid endarterectomy. The most common causes of stroke are two diseases of aging: hypertension and atherosclerosis. Therefore, although stroke may occur at any age, the incidence is highest among the elderly population. Noninvasive efforts to reduce the risk of stroke in the elderly include control of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, low-cholesterol dietary habits, and moderate exercise. Routine low-dose aspirin also provides some protective effect. High-risk patients (with asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, TIAs, or prior stroke) should be considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy in the absence of contraindications to surgery. 
Comparison of 1 or 3 MU of interferon alfa-2b and placebo in patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Ninety patients with histologically documented chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis were randomly allocated to receive SC injections of placebo or of 1 or 3 MU of recombinant interferon alfa-2b three times weekly for 24 weeks. Complete normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels occurred posttreatment in 43.3% of patients receiving 3 MU, in 20% of those receiving 1 MU, and in 6.7% of untreated patients (P less than 0.0005 vs. those treated with 3 MU). Alanine aminotransferase normalization was sustained for 6 months after therapy in 13.3% of the patients treated with 3 MU and in 3.3% of those given 1 MU or placebo. The decline of alanine aminotransferase levels following interferon therapy showed independent, positive correlations with female sex (P less than 0.03) and younger age (P less than 0.05). The Knodell's fibrosis score was strongly positively correlated with age (P less than 0.0001). It is concluded that 3 MU of interferon is a more effective dose than 1 MU for controlling disease activity in non-A, non-B chronic hepatitis patients. Women and younger and noncirrhotic patients are more likely to respond. 
Angiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. 
Paraplegia in a pregnant thalassemic woman due to extramedullary hematopoiesis: successful management with transfusions. The investigation and treatment of a pregnant thalassemic woman who developed severe paraplegia is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a paravertebral mass infiltrating the epidural space, resulting from extramedullary hematopoiesis (marrow heterotopia). The patient was treated successfully with repeated blood transfusions and made a complete recovery. The literature (36 cases) is reviewed and the magnetic resonance imaging features of spinal extramedullary hematopoiesis are presented. The efficacy of transfusions in the management of spinal cord compression due to marrow heterotopia in thalassemic patients is discussed. 
Hypertension following erythropoietin therapy in anemic hemodialysis patients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) corrects the anemia of end-stage renal disease. However, hypertension has been observed as an adverse effect of increasing red cell mass. In our study, 44 of 63 patients (70%) treated with rHuEpo had an increase in mean arterial pressure greater than 10 mm Hg or required new or additional hypertensive medications. Retrospective analysis disclosed that increasing blood pressure was associated with pretreatment hematocrit level less than or equal to 0.20 (P = .05) and dependency on red cell transfusions (P less than .01). Factors not associated with hypertension included the rate of rise of the hematocrit, the net rise in hematocrit, age, sex, the number of years on dialysis, the presence or absence of kidneys, smoking, or the presence of pretreatment hypertension. Noninvasive hemodynamic studies in eight normotensive patients before and after improvement of the anemia demonstrated a normalization of the decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction toward normal in the elevated cardiac output. In three of these patients, clinical hypertension subsequently evolved. Follow-up hemodynamic studies in nine other patients receiving new or additional antihypertensive medications were difficult to interpret. Although the hypertension can be controlled with routine medication, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur if the blood pressure increases rapidly when the hematocrit increases with rHuEpo therapy. 
Is craniospinal irradiation required to cure children with malignant (anaplastic) intracranial ependymomas? Between 1970 and 1989, 17 children with histologically malignant intracranial ependymomas received treatment at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). Eleven were treated with prophylactic cranial or craniospinal irradiation plus a local boost (CS-XRT), five with local (L-XRT) irradiation only, and one was treated without (NRT) irradiation. With a median survival of 2 years and a median follow-up time for long-term survivors of 6.0 years, five of 11 patients who received CS-XRT are alive compared with none treated with L-XRT and none treated with NRT. Two-year actuarial survival rates are 40% (L-XRT) and 52% (CS-XRT). When examined for other factors, age and local radiation dose remain the most significant prognostic indicators of survival. The 2-year actuarial survival for children younger than 4 years at diagnosis is 20% compared with 83% for their older counterparts. Likewise, the 2-year survival for patients treated with local radiation doses over 4500 cGy was 55% compared with 0% for patients treated with lesser doses. To date there are a total of 28 recurrences. All have occurred with local components except for six (unknown) who died before the exact site(s) could be determined. There is no significant difference in the failure rates outside the original tumor bed in the three groups. These data suggest that local relapse remains the most significant component of failure. Because intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as age and radiation dose seem to be interrelated and at least as important as the use of craniospinal irradiation, the need for prophylactic treatment for children with anaplastic ependymoma could neither be substantiated nor refuted. The use of local radiation alone, however, should be restricted to carefully designed clinical trials in which meticulous pretreatment evaluation is performed, and vigilant posttreatment evaluation of the spine and brain is mandatory. 
Increased free light chains in the urine from patients with multiple sclerosis. We quantitated free kappa (kappa) and lambda light (L) chains in coded urine specimens from subjects with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (N = 56), other neurologic diseases (OND) (N = 30), and age-matched normal controls (N = 28). Urine from MS patients showed statistically significant increases in free L chains compared with the other groups, although there was overlap between MS patients and OND patients. The ratio of kappa/creatinine was significantly greater in the relapsing-remitting MS group than in patients with clinically stable MS, OND, and normal controls. Elevated free L chains were usually independent of urinary albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels. Serial studies showed that urinary free kappa/creatinine ratios were elevated during periods of clinical worsening in seven of eight MS patients and subsequently decreased during clinical recovery. The measurement of free L chains in urine obtained at intervals from MS patients may be useful as a marker to monitor disease activity. 
The interaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 with plasminogen activators (tissue-type and urokinase-type) and fibrin: localization of interaction sites and physiologic relevance. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), an essential regulatory protein of the fibrinolytic system, harbors interaction sites for plasminogen activators (tissue-type [t-PA] and urokinase-type [u-PA]) and for fibrin. In this study, anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used to identify interaction sites of PAI-1 with these components. The binding sites of 18 different MoAbs were established and are located on five distinct "linear" areas of PAI-1. MoAbs, binding to two distinct areas of PAI-1, are able to prevent the inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1. In addition, two interaction sites for fibrin were identified on PAI-1. The area located between amino acids 110 and 145 of PAI-1 contains a binding site for both components and its significance is discussed in the context of the t-PA inhibition by fibrin-bound PAI-1. Subsequently, the MoAbs were used to assess the role of platelet-PAI-1 in clot-lysis. An in vitro clot-lysis system was used to demonstrate that clot-lysis resistance is dependent on the presence of activated platelets and that PAI-1 is a major determinant for lysis-resistance. We propose that, upon activation of platelets, PAI-1 is fixed within the clot by binding to fibrin and retains its full capacity to inhibit t-PA and u-PA. 
Granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis in a patient without underlying illness. Computed tomographic appearances and treatment by pneumonectomy. Pulmonary zygomycosis rarely occurs in the absence of underlying disease. We report a patient with granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis without underlying disease who presented with a pulmonary mass. We present the computed tomographic findings that we believe have not been described previously. We also report the successful treatment by pneumonectomy. 
Mucosal dysplasia and DNA content in ulcerative colitis patients with ileorectal anastomosis. Follow-up study in a defined patient group. In a follow-up study of an epidemiologically defined patient group comprising 1,274 patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in Stockholm County during 1955-1979, 55 patients had undergone colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Nine of these were found to have Crohn's disease after histopathologic review of the colectomy specimens. Of the 46 patients with ulcerative colitis remaining for evaluation, two died postoperatively. Twenty-five patients were subsequently reoperated with rectal excision owing to intractable inflammatory activity (n = 22, one postoperative death) or owing to dysplasia (n = 3). Of 19 patients with their IRA still intact at time of follow-up, 15 patients (median disease duration 23 years) had a flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies performed. The average length of the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was 26 cm. No patient had findings of dysplasia, carcinoma, or DNA aneuploidy. None of the four remaining patients had developed dysplasia or carcinoma at the time of the latest regular rigid sigmoidoscopy. The risk of malignant transformation in this selected group of patients with ulcerative colitis operated upon with colectomy and IRA derived from an epidemiologically defined population seems to be low. 
Is erythrokeratoderma one disorder? A clinical and ultrastructural study of two siblings. Two sisters with erythrokeratoderma are described. In the younger sister the clinical appearance corresponded to erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV), whereas in the older sister it corresponded to progressive symmetrical erythrokeratoderma (PSEK). Ultrastructural findings in both cases were identical. We suggest that EKV and PSEK are different manifestations of a single condition. 
Oral contraceptives increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentration in women with polycystic ovarian disease. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulates ovarian androgen production. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) inhibits IGF actions in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of oral contraceptive (OC) pills, given for 3 months, on serum gonadotropin, androgen, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 concentrations, and glucose tolerance in seven women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) and in five healthy control subjects. PATIENTS: Seven women with PCOD and five healthy control subjects. INTERVENTIONS: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and after treatment with OC. RESULTS: After treatment with OC, serum luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, and free testosterone levels decreased, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentration increased in the women with PCOD as well as in the control subjects. The cumulative response of serum insulin to OGTT was larger in the women with PCOD than in the control subjects both before and after treatment. Serum IGF-I concentration, which was unchanged during OGTT, decreased from basal level of 326 +/- 70 micrograms/L to 199 +/- 28 micrograms/L after treatment with OC in the women with PCOD, whereas no change was found in the control subjects (from 235 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 226 +/- 11 micrograms/L). Treatment with OC caused an increase of the mean basal IGFBP-1 concentration from 24 +/- 7 micrograms/L to 73 +/- 14 micrograms/L in the women with PCOD. This increase was constant during the OGTT. In the control subjects, treatment with OC did not result in any significant change in IGFBP-1 concentrations (from 44 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 61 +/- 9 micrograms/L). CONCLUSION: The combination of decreased total IGF-I concentration and increased IGFBP-1 concentration induced by OC may decrease ovarian androgen production in PCOD. 
Immunohistochemical demonstration of CD23 expression on lymphocytes in rheumatoid synovitis. The leucocyte antigen CD23 is expressed by B lymphocytes following activation by a number of stimuli and functions as an IgE receptor, and in its soluble form, as a putative B cell growth factor. The expression of CD23 on the surface of lymphocytes in paraffin wax sections of synovial biopsy specimens was studied using a novel mouse monoclonal antibody, BU38. Specimens were investigated from nine cases of rheumatoid arthritis, six cases of osteoarthritis, and eight cases of chronic inflammation in articular and non-articular tissues. CD23 was expressed on a high proportion of lymphocytes in all forms of chronic inflammation and was not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It may be a characteristic feature of any chronic inflammatory response. As CD23 was found on the surface of lymphocytes in many cases of these arthritides, sCD23 in serum or synovial fluid may yet prove a useful marker for the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate. 
Ulcerative colitis in the autotransplanted neovagina. A 33-year-old woman had undergone a radical surgical excision for carcinoma of the vagina at age 11. Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens. 
An atrial natriuretic factor analogue at low doses attenuates forearm reflex vasoconstriction to cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation in patients with hypertension. Contrasting data exist about a possible modulation of the autonomic function by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in human beings, particularly at low, biologically, significant concentrations. We have evaluated that possibility by increasing plasma ANF levels through the infusion of a synthetic analogue (WY-47,663, anaritide) in five male patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg x 5 min) was used to selectively deactivate cardiopulmonary receptors and to stimulate sympathetic efferent tone reflexogenically. ANF was given at either a low rate (0.005 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, which was previously shown to increase plasma ANF in a range compatible with physiologic stimuli) or at a high rate (0.05 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, each). Administration of ANF was preceded and followed by vehicle infusion (Haemacell x 30 min). Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), intraarterial blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored continuously, and venous immunoreactive ANF, plasma renin activity, aldosterone level, and venous hematocrit were measured at the end of both control and infusion periods. Arterial norepinephrine values, an indirect index of sympathetic discharge, were measured at rest and during lower body negative pressure conditions. Graded systemic ANF infusion increased immunoreactive ANF and venous hematocrit, decreased aldosterone level and plasma renin activity, whereas resting norepinephrine levels, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change. Lower body negative pressure decreased forearm blood flow during vehicle infusion, but it lost its vasoconstrictor effect during infusion of ANF. To identify the site of that inhibitory action, ANF was also infused into the brachial artery at rates that raised local but not systemic levels of immunoreactive ANF. 
Immunological evidence for the co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis in two patients. Two patients are described in whom a clinical and electromyographic diagnosis of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was made. Serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), the antigenic target in LEMS and to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the antigen in myasthenia gravis, were detected at raised titres in both cases, using radioimmunoassays based on 125I-omega-Conotoxin labelled VGCCs and 125I-alpha-Bungarotoxin labelled AChRs. These data provide immunological evidence for the coexistence of the two disorders in these patients. 
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy: application to pediatric head and neck masses. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy cytology is widely used to screen masses in adults. The authors present a series of 89 fine-needle aspiration biopsies performed between January 1973 and December 1988 on 86 pediatric patients with clinically significant head and neck masses. All fine-needle aspiration diagnoses were confirmed by subsequent surgical biopsy, autopsy, or clinical follow-up for a minimum of 18 months. Of 21 tumors identified, 19 were malignant. Of the 89 aspirations performed, 67 required no subsequent surgical biopsy. In 11 of these cases, metastatic or recurrent tumor was diagnosed and appropriate therapy instituted. Fifteen of the 89 aspirates revealed previously undiagnosed tumors requiring surgical intervention. One false-negative and two false-positive results were obtained. No radical treatment resulted from the false-positive diagnoses, and no patient delay in treatment occurred because of the false-negative result. The sensitivity was 94.4%, and the specificity was 97.1%. The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fine-needle aspiration is stressed. 
Orthotopic cardiac transplantation in two patients with previous malignancy. This report presents 2 patients with previous malignancy in whom congestive cardiomyopathy developed secondary to doxorubicin toxicity. Both patients underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation 3 and 5 years ago and are now in functional class I with no evidence of malignant recurrence. 
Priapism as a manifestation of isolated genital vasculitis. Vasculitis may affect virtually any organ system in the body. We describe a patient who presented with priapism due to isolated genital vasculitis. This responded promptly to oral corticosteroids. In patients presenting with priapism, a possible underlying vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis; the treatment for this may be nonsurgical. 
Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection. 
Dynamic exercise-induced elevation in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with effort angina pectoris. We investigated the relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) levels and hemodynamic indices during dynamic exercise testing in 15 patients with effort angina pectoris. Patients exercised on an angina-limited, supine, multistage bicycle ergometer, and plasma ANP levels and hemodynamic indices were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and 6 minutes after exercise. Plasma ANP levels increased significantly at peak exercise. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF) were significantly correlated with plasma ANP levels before and at peak exercise (PAWP: r = 0.69, p less than 0.001; CSBF; r = 0.45, p less than 0.05). In six of eight patients whose PAWP exceeded 20 mm Hg at peak exercise, plasma ANP levels were increased at 6 minutes after exercise, whereas PAWP had decreased relative to the values obtained at peak exercise. Plasma ANP concentrations at 6 minutes after exercise were not correlated with PAWP at the same time. However, PAWP at peak exercise was correlated with the plasma ANP levels at 6 minutes after exercise (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that in patients with effort angina pectoris left ventricular dysfunction resulting from exercise-induced myocardial ischemia may increase preload excessively and may contribute to the excess secretion of ANP after dynamic exercise. 
Acute appendicitis in patients with AIDS/HIV infection. Nine patients known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and operated on for acute appendicitis are presented. Six of the nine patients did not have an elevation in the white blood cell count preoperatively. Two patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy prior to exploration. In four cases, a perforated appendix was removed. Seven patients had persistent postoperative fever, while all nine had a significant lack of leukocytosis after surgery. Other than the absence of a preoperative increase in white blood cell count, the presenting characteristics of this group were similar to those expected in immunocompetent patients. However, concern for a possible opportunistic infection etiology and a desire to avoid operating on these patients resulted in an undue delay prior to exploration. The use of diagnostic laparoscopy aided in earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Despite persistent postoperative fever, appendectomy was performed in patients with AIDS/HIV infection without significant increase in morbidity and mortality. 
Changes in hypertension treatment and in congestive heart failure mortality in the United States. The use of antihypertensive agents has increased in recent years and has been more marked among individuals in older age groups (65-74 years) than in middle-aged groups (45-54 years). Because hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, more common use of antihypertensive agents would be expected to reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure. Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades. 
Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. 
Sigmoid sinus thrombosis diagnosis by contrasted MRI scanning. Septic thrombosis of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and the jugular bulb is a highly lethal condition. The presenting signs and symptoms of this disease entity are subtle and not in proportion to the magnitude of the problem. Later in the disease course, sudden fulminant findings appear. A high index of suspicion, combined with scanning techniques of either enhanced MRI or CT, allows prompt diagnosis and treatment. MRI enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) is a valuable adjunct that confirms the diagnosis and delineates the extent of suspected pathology. 
Coarctation and hypoplasia of the aortic arch: will the arch grow? Hypoplasia of the transverse aortic arch of various degrees of severity is commonly seen in infants who have coarctation of the aorta. It is more often present when the coarctation is associated with intracardiac lesions that diminish or limit forward flow in the ascending aorta and promote right to left flow through an arterial duct. The increased frequency of surgical treatment of infants with complex coarctation, which is in part related to the ability to stabilize their condition with prostaglandin E1, has posed the question of the potential for growth and development of the originally hypoplastic aortic arch after conventional repair of aortic coarctation. Review of our experience with transverse aortic arch hypoplasia, found in 33 (32%) of 102 infants undergoing coarctation repair by subclavian flap aortoplasty or classic resection and end-to-end anastomosis, revealed excellent growth of the transverse arch after repair in all patients available for linear follow-up. The currently proposed extended arch repair should be reserved for the small group of infants with transverse aortic arch to ascending aorta diameter ratios (arch indices) of less than 0.25. 
Mechanism of augmented left atrial pump function in myocardial infarction and essential hypertension evaluated by left atrial pressure-dimension relation. To analyze left atrial (LA) pump function in normal subjects, in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with a healed myocardial infarction, LA dimension (aortic-root echogram) and pressure (catheter-tip manometer) were simultaneously recorded in 25 patients (8 normal subjects, 7 with hypertension and 10 with myocardial infarction). The pressure-dimension relation of the left atrium was composed of 2 loops: the A loop (expressing the pump function of the left atrium) and the V loop. LA dimension at the beginning of active LA shortening was significantly greater in hypertensive subjects (33 +/- 3 mm) and in those with myocardial infarction (32 +/- 4 mm) than in normal subjects (28 +/- 3 mm) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). The area of the A loop significantly increased in subjects with hypertension (48 +/- 3 mm Hg.mm, p less than 0.01) and in subjects with myocardial infarction (29 +/- 10 mm Hg.mm, p less than 0.05), compared with normal subjects (20 +/- 8 mm Hg.mm). The mean fractional shortening velocity of the left atrium significantly increased in subjects with hypertension, compared with normal subjects and those with myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05 for both). LA peak wall tension during the LA active contraction period significantly increased with hypertension and with myocardial infarction, compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). The area of the A loop was directly proportional to the LA dimension at the beginning of active LA shortening (r = 0.53), p less than 0.01). 
Observation of spinal canal and cisternae with the newly developed small-diameter, flexible fiberscopes. Small-diameter (0.5-, 0.9-, and 1.4-mm) flexible fiberscopes were developed for visual diagnosis of spinal canal diseases. The fiberscopes were introduced via a Tuohy needle into the subarachnoid and epidural spaces of ten patients with various pain syndromes. Clear visualization of the subarachnoid space was achieved using the fiberscopes. The epidural space could be visualized only during withdrawal of the fiberscope. In five cases, the fiberscope could be advanced up to the level of the cisternae without causing the patient any discomfort. A slight headache and transient fever were noted after the examination in five and two cases, respectively, but no other complications occurred. Interestingly, preexisting pain diminished (two cases) or disappeared (one case) after the myeloscopy in three of five cases in which the myeloscopy revealed aseptic adhesive arachnoiditis. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate the usefulness of this technique. 
Thickening at the root of the superior mesenteric artery on sonography: evidence of vascular involvement in patients with cancer of the pancreas. Thickening of the root of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was studied by using preoperative sonography in 23 patients with pancreatic cancer and in 10 healthy control subjects. Of the 23 with cancer, 11 had neoplastic involvement of the SMA and 12 did not. Prominent thickening of the area around the SMA with (six patients) or without (five patients) decreased echogenicity compared with the adjacent retropancreatic connective tissue was observed in patients with involvement of the SMA, a finding called the "cuff sign." Mean thickness of the periarterial area in the cancer patients with and without involvement of the SMA and in control subjects were 8.5 mm, 4.0 mm, and 2.9 mm, respectively. With an upper limit of normal of 7.0 mm for the thickness of the SMA, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of this sign in the evaluation of involvement of the SMA were 91%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. Decreased echogenicity of the periarterial area was not observed in patients without involvement of the SMA or in control subjects. Our results show that sonographic evidence of periarterial thickening of the root of the SMA (cuff sign), especially with decreased echogenicity, is a reliable finding of tumor infiltration of the SMA in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. 
Masseter muscle spasm in children: implications of continuing the triggering anesthetic. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the management and outcome of children who developed isolated masseter muscle spasm (MMS) after the administration of intravenous succinylcholine during anesthetic induction. The inhalation anesthetics used for induction were continued in all of these cases. The medical records of 68 patients (male/female ratio, 1.7:1), identified from approximately 42,000 anesthetics given during the period 1980-1989, were reviewed. Fifty-seven children (2.3-12 yr old) were diagnosed as having isolated MMS, i.e., MMS without spasm of other muscles; 11 experienced generalized rigidity in combination with MMS. Anesthetic and postoperative management of these two groups differed. The overall incidence of MMS was 0.3% of inhalation anesthetics during which succinylcholine was given. Intraoperative arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the patients who developed isolated MMS and more frequently in older children. Most children experienced some degree of hypercarbia and/or metabolic acidosis, but the significance of these abnormalities in the spontaneously ventilating, fasting child is unknown. Serum creatine kinase levels when measured 18-24 h postoperatively were elevated in all but one child (n = 45). There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. We conclude that failure of the masseter muscles to relax after succinylcholine is not uncommon in children. Based on our experience, and accepting that MMS may be part of the clinical spectrum of malignant hyperthermia, we believe that anesthesia can be continued safely in cases of isolated MMS when careful monitoring accompanies diagnostic evaluation. This differs from the current practice of discontinuing the anesthetic or switching to a nontriggering anesthetic technique. 
Hemisphere asymmetry in decision making abilities. An experimental study in unilateral brain damage. Thirty control subjects and 60 unilateral brain-damaged patients, 30 with left hemisphere (LH) damage and 30 with right hemisphere (RH) disease, underwent a disjunctive 4-choice reaction time study. Speed of reaction (as defined by the reciprocal of reaction time (RT), movement time (MT) and total response time (TRT] and accuracy of response (as represented by the sum of errors in selecting the correct response key) were investigated comparatively as a function of side of lesion and of performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (PM47). In contrast to movement speed (1/MT), reaction speed (1/RT) as well as total response speed (1/TRT) showed a lesion effect independent of side of damage. Conversely, accuracy was differentially impaired, LH damage being associated with a significantly higher number of errors. Speed and accuracy had different relationships with the performance on the PM47 in the two hemisphere groups. Speed was affected in parallel with changes in PM47 performance both in the LH and in RH groups, whereas accuracy was altered only in LH patients. It was concluded that speed of motor reaction is affected by unilateral brain lesions irrespective of their side, whereas decision making processes, as expressed by accuracy of response, seem to be specifically impaired by LH damage. 
Cisplatin and etoposide as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma: a prospective randomized trial of the Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research. In this prospective randomized study, first-line treatment with the combination of cisplatin (P) and etoposide (E) was compared with the standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) combination in 140 patients. Complete remissions were obtained in 11% of 65 assessable patients on CMF and in 12% of 65 assessable patients on PE. Complete plus partial remission rates were 48% on CMF and 63% on PE (P = .08). Time to progression (median, 32 v 31 weeks), duration of response (48 v 39 weeks), and survival (75 v 76 weeks) were not different. Hematologic toxicity was significantly higher with PE, and gastrointestinal side effects were frequent with this treatment. This study demonstrated that the PE combination is effective as front-line chemotherapy. As far as response rate is concerned, a trend of superiority over CMF was observed, which was of borderline significance. Due to the lack of survival advantage and to toxicity, this combination is not recommended for routine clinical use. However, its high level of activity should be taken into account for further research. 
Idiopathic colonic perforation in the neonate. We describe a premature infant in whom spontaneous perforation of the colon was initially detected on routine abdominal films. There was no clinical evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, peritonitis, or bowel obstruction. Surgical and pathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic bowel perforation. Since spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation in the neonate is often difficult to diagnose clinically, radiographic evaluation may allow earlier diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment of this life-threatening condition. 
Prognostic factors and complication rates for cervical cerclage: a review of 482 cases. Charts from 482 singleton pregnancies undergoing cerclage placement in patients over a 6-year period were reviewed. Cervical dilatation at time of surgery, number of previous spontaneous losses, and gestational age at placement were key determinants of outcome. The most frequent complication, premature rupture of the membranes, ultimately occurred in 38% of patients. The 6.6% infection rate was increased in patients undergoing emergent versus elective surgery (12.7% vs 4.7%, p less than 0.005) and in patients at increased dilatation at time of surgery (5.7% for less than or equal to 2 cm vs 41.7% for greater than 2 cm, p less than 0.005). McDonald and Shirodkar procedures had similar obstetric outcomes in patients undergoing their first cerclage. The subgroup of patients with prior cerclage surgery showed improved birth weight when the Shirodkar procedure was performed instead of the McDonald cerclage (mean birth weight 3020 vs 2470 gm, p less than 0.005). An increased rate of primary cesarean section was found in the Shirodkar group (31% vs 17%, p less than 0.005). Complication rates and pregnancy outcome appear to reflect cervical dilatation more than gestational age at time of surgery. 
Extraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. 
Hepatotoxicity of rifampin and isoniazid. Is it all drug-induced hepatitis? Serologic markers for hepatitis viruses were studied in 40 children who developed acute hepatitis during antituberculosis therapy with rifampin and isoniazid, with the aim of assessing the contributory role of these viruses toward producing hepatic injury. Hepatitis A and B were confirmed in 7.5 and 35% patients, respectively, by IgM antibodies. Epidemiologic evidence suggested the possibility of non-A, non-B hepatitis in at least a few of the remaining 23 children. Hepatitis B was seen more often in children with severe tubercular disease (72%) and was largely (92.8%) parenterally transmitted. The study highlights that the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries, among other factors, could also be responsible for the reported higher incidence of hepatotoxicity from developing countries and also for the increased risk of hepatotoxicity seen in severe tubercular disease. 
Hyperemesis gravidarum. A comparison of single and multiple admissions. Recurrent hyperemesis gravidarum is a frustrating and poorly studied complication of early pregnancy. Between 1979 and 1987, 140 women with emesis severe enough to require parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacement were admitted to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital, Charleston, on 220 occasions. Thirty-nine of the 140 women were admitted on multiple occasions. A comparison of clinical characteristics of women with single and multiple admissions revealed no significant differences except that women admitted repeatedly for hyperemesis gravidarum were more likely to be nulliparous (P less than .05). Ptyalism (59% vs. 9%) and persistent vomiting for greater than 24 hours after admission (69% vs. 23%) were significantly more common among women who were admitted repeatedly (P less than .05). Despite published reports that hyperemesis gravidarum has no impact on ultimate perinatal outcome, this study indicated that women admitted repeatedly have a more severe nutritional disturbance, associated with significantly reduced maternal weight gain and neonatal birth weight. These risks argue for more aggressive antenatal treatment and increased fetal surveillance in pregnancies complicated by recurrent hyperemesis gravidarum. 
Vancomycin added to empirical combination antibiotic therapy for fever in granulocytopenic cancer patients. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group and the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group [published erratum appears in J Infect Dis 1991 Oct;164(4):832] A total of 747 febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer were randomized to receive ceftazidime plus amikacin (CA) with or without vancomycin (V) as initial empirical therapy. Single gram-positive bacteremias responded in 29 (43%) of 68 patients treated with CA and in 48 (72%) of 67 treated with CAV (P = .001). For single gram-negative bacteremias and clinically documented and possible infections the response rates of CA and CAV were 80% and 63% (P = .17), 55% and 75% (P = .009), and 74% and 81% (P = .16), respectively. However, for patients with gram-positive bacteremia and for all other patients, there were no differences by treatment regimens in the proportion of febrile patients on each trial day (P = .85, P = .82, respectively) or in the duration of fever (P = .22, P = .93, respectively). Moreover, no patient with gram-positive bacteremia died during the first 3 days of true empirical therapy. Antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity was more frequent in patients treated with vancomycin (6% vs. 2%, P = .02). These results do not support the empirical addition of vancomycin to initial antibiotic therapy in cancer patients with fever and granulocytopenia. 
The conversion of primaquine into primaquine-aldehyde, primaquine-alcohol, and carboxyprimaquine, a major plasma metabolite. Although efficacy and toxicity of primaquine (PQ) depend on bioconversion, the process is poorly understood, even for carboxyprimaquine (CPQ), the major plasma metabolite. Earlier work to clarify drug metabolism showed that PQ could be converted quantitatively into CPQ, in vitro, with human erythroleukemic K562 cells or nonleukemic bone marrow supplemented with calf serum. We have now found--using systems with serum only, as well as with K562, bone marrow, and adult or embryonic liver cells--that the bioconversion of the side chain of PQ involves a branched pathway with at least three separate enzymes and two derivatives other than CPQ. An oxidase activity in serum converted PQ first into a novel side chain aldehyde (Y). Aldehyde dehydrogenase transformed PQ-aldehyde into CPQ in cell-free systems and in K562, bone marrow, and adult liver cells. Embryonic hepatocytes or bone marrow treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea did not produce CPQ; instead, they made a metabolite (Xc) that we could synthetize via PQ-aldehyde and identify as PQ-alcohol. PQ-alcohol replaced CPQ as the final product whenever alcohol-dehydrogenase prevailed over aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes operated in intact cells and controlled the biotransformation of PQ absolutely. Unless both dehydrogenase were absent, inhibited, or deprived of coenzyme, potentially cytotoxic PQ-aldehyde intermediate did not accumulate. Some of the unique tissues schizonticidal and gametocidal effects of PQ may depend on the distribution pattern and relative activities of PQ oxidase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase in human subjects and in parasites. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver causing biliary obstruction. Treatment by biliary stenting with 5-year follow-up. Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are rare lesions that are becoming increasingly recognized, possibly because of frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography. Most previously reported cases have been treated by hepatic resection. For this reason, we describe a patient with obstructive jaundice secondary to an inflammatory hepatic pseudotumor in the porta hepatis. Bilateral internal biliary stents were inserted, and the patient remains well 5 years later. The clinicopathologic features of inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are described, as are the implications of accurate diagnosis. There have been no previous reports of biliary stenting in management of inflammatory hepatic pseudotumors. 
Syncope and orthostatic hypotension. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies. 
A meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery. Although it is generally agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the prevention of postoperative wound infection, the choice of antibiotic regimen is controversial. In an attempt to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen, a meta-analysis of published clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck surgery was undertaken. The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis. This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery. 
Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor of soft parts. Additional observations of a distinctive soft tissue tumor. The author studied four subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, similar to those recently described by Enzinger and associates (Am J Surg Pathol 1989;13:817) by the name "ossifying fibromyxoid tumor," by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to further understand the cellular nature of this lesion. The four tumors were composed of uniform round cells often surrounded by a lacunar space. The tumors often contained a peripheral zone of metaplastic bone. The cellularity was high, but the mitotic rate was low, suggesting a benign or borderline nature of the lesion. Longer follow-up was available for three cases, showing recurrence-free survival times of 11, 8, and 3 years. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that all tumors were strongly positive for S-100 protein and focally positive for Leu-7, whereas melanoma-specific marker HMB45 was negative. Vimentin was the main type of intermediate filament protein, and one case also contained scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Epithelial markers (keratins, epithelial membrane antigen), desmin, and muscle actins were negative. Electron microscopic examination showed partial, sometimes reduplicated, basal lamina surrounding many cells. Complex cell processes were also present. No myofilaments were found. The immunohistochemical and electron microscopic results may suggest that this tumor has Schwann's cell differentiation. 
Mucosal vascular stasis precedes loss of viability of endothelial cells in rat acetic acid colitis. The hypothesis that a significant reduction in colonic mucosal perfusion, and hence ischemic injury, precedes the development of mucosal ulceration and inflammation is tested in this report. The microcirculatory changes in the rat colonic mucosa within 1 hr of topical exposure to 10% acetic acid were assessed. Colonic mucosal blood flow signals measured by laser Doppler flowmetry were significantly reduced to 61 +/- 8, 52 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of baseline values at 1 min, 4 min, and 10 min after the colonic mucosa was exposed to 10% acetic acid, respectively, but not in controls exposed to saline. After the start of application of 10% acetic acid (for 4 min), in vivo microscopy studies demonstrated that colonic mucosal ischemia (stasis of the red blood cells in the mucosal capillaries) occurred at 9 +/- 5 min (mean +/- SEM). Evidence of endothelial cell death (failure to exclude a fluorescent dye, propidium iodide, by endothelial cells) developed at 25 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SEM). These findings indicate that within minutes after contact of the colonic mucosa with 10% acetic acid, colonic mucosal ischemia develops, followed shortly by death of endothelial cells. The data do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the reductions in mucosal blood flow and loss of endothelial cell viability in response to acetic acid. Nevertheless, because these events occur at such an early time point, they may play a pathogenetic role in the development of the subsequent inflammatory and ulcerative changes in this animal model of colitis. Further studies to define the potential causal relationships between these parameters are warranted. 
Sufentanil citrate and morphine/bupivacaine as alternative agents in chronic epidural infusions for intractable non-cancer pain. Intraspinal narcotic (usually intrathecal morphine) infusions with implanted pumps are increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain not caused by cancer. In some patients, pain control is difficult with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses of arachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or vertebral body compression fracture were treated with alternative solutions in an epidural route. For maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmable infusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In three patients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain relief without significant side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epidural infusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no side effects. Four other patients found more effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanil citrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47% in these patients. Pain relief and minimal side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to result from its higher lipophilicity promoting local transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upward diffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 times more potent than morphine and therefore allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses. Although this study was done on a limited number of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epidural infusions using programmable infusion pumps for non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drug combinations and routes. 
Processing of the precursor of NF-kappa B by the HIV-1 protease during acute infection. Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome is regulated in part by cellular factors and is stimulated by activation of latently infected T cells. T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor NF-kappa B which binds to two adjacent sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. This factor consists of two DNA-binding subunits of relative molecular mass 50,000 (50K) associated with two 65K subunits. It is located in the nucleus in mature B cells, but is present in other cell types as an inactive cytoplasmic complex. External stimuli, including those that activate T cells, result in nuclear translocation of active NF-kappa B. The cloning of the complementary DNA for the 50K subunit helped to identify an exclusively cytoplasmic 105K precursor (p105) (V.B., P.K. and A.I., manuscript submitted). The expression of active NF-kappa B might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of p105. Because HIV-1 requires active NF-kappa B for efficient transcription, we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the human 105K precursor. We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex. 
Trichinella spiralis infection alters small bowel motor activity in the fed state. The effect of Trichinella spiralis infection on small intestinal transit and motor activity in the fed state during the intestinal phase of infection was studied. Contractions were recorded by strain gauge transducers, and mean transit time was measured by marker dilution technique. The mean amplitude and area of individual phasic contractions decreased, but no change occurred in their mean duration during trichinosis. The total amplitude and area of phasic contractions also decreased; this was caused by a decrease in the frequency of contractions as well as a decrease in the mean parameters. The reduction in the total duration was entirely caused by the decrease in frequency. The reduction in the total parameters of all contractions was the result of a reduction in the same parameters for both propagating and nonpropagating contractions. However, the decrease in the parameters of propagating contractions was much greater. Also, there was a decrease in the distance of propagation of phasic contractions. The transit time as a result of phasic contractions increased during T. spiralis infection. Additionally, T. spiralis infection induced giant migrating contractions in the fed state that were never observed during control. Chyme was propelled very rapidly and effectively by giant migrating contractions. The findings of the present study suggest that during diarrhea induced by T. spiralis infection, the phasic contractions may act to decrease transit and, hence, allow more contact time for absorption of water and nutrients. However, this response may be counter-balanced by giant migrating contractions that rapidly propel chyme into the colon and compound the diarrhea associated with T. spiralis infection. 
Identification of stromal cell precursors in human bone marrow by a novel monoclonal antibody, STRO-1. Murine IgM monoclonal antibody STRO-1 identifies a cell surface antigen expressed by stromal elements in human bone marrow (BM). STRO-1 binds to approximately 10% of BM mononuclear cells, greater than 95% of which are nucleated erythroid precursors, but does not react with committed progenitor cells (colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM], erythroid bursts [BFU-E], and mixed colonies [CFU-Mix]). Fibroblast colony-forming cells (CFU-F) are present exclusively in the STRO-1+ population. Dual-color cell sorting using STRO-1 in combination with antibody to glycophorin A yields a population approximately 100-fold enriched in CFU-F in the STRO-1+/glycophorin A+ population. When plated under long-term BM culture (LTBMC) conditions, STRO-1+ cells generate adherent cell layers containing multiple stromal cell types, including adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblastic elements. STRO-1+ cells isolated from LTBMC at later times retain the capacity to generate adherent layers with a cellular composition identical to that of the parent cultures. The STRO-1-selected adherent layers are able to support the generation of clonogenic cells and mature hematopoietic cells from a population of CD34+ cells highly enriched in so-called long-term culture-initiating cells. We conclude that antibody STRO-1 binds to BM stromal elements with the capacity to transfer the hematopoietic microenvironment in vitro. 
Percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy and decompression with a 6.9-millimeter cannula. Analysis of operative failures and complications. The operative failures and complications of percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy were analyzed in 100 patients who had a herniated nucleus pulposus and were prospectively studied and treated with use of a 6.9-millimeter outer-diameter (4.9-millimeter inner-diameter) sheath and manual insertion of the instruments. Twelve operations were considered to have failed, regardless of the length of postoperative follow-up or the incidence of reinjury; eleven patients had a repeat operation at the index level, and one patient was a chronic drug-abuser. In eight of the eleven patients, subsequent laminectomy was successful. Two patients had a psoas hematoma and one had a transitory sensory and distal motor deficit; all of these complications resolved without sequelae. There were no major complications, including superficial or deep infection, and no patient had neurovascular compromise. 
Obesity in minority populations: policy implications of research. Obesity is a major health problem for many Americans, with an overall prevalence for adults of approximately 25% and a range for specific subgroups of 24-75%. This range is striking and reflects many factors shown to influence the development and maintenance of obesity, including physical activity, diet, ethnicity, income, education, and genetic susceptibility. Many minority populations have higher prevalences of obesity and, thus, experience its adverse health consequences disproportionately. Research in diverse populations indicates that the relative importance of risk factors for cardiovascular disease varies in many populations. Data characterizing the profile of risk factors, including obesity and physical activity, for various special populations are limited and some, such as obesity, are based on standards developed in the general population. For public health policy and interventions to succeed, they must address the needs of special populations and of the overall population. This paper discusses some of the relevant broader social and research issues. 
Bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) of total body composition in alcohol-induced migraine patients. Preliminary report. "Whole body composition" was investigated in 30 people subject to alcohol-induced migraine. The control group was 30 people matched for age, sex, height and weight, who were not subject to migraine and who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol. The following were evaluated: anthropometric data, alcohol intake in grams per day, total body water, fat-free mass, fat mass, and body mass index (kg/m2). Two methods of measurement were used: skin fold thickness evaluation, and bioelectric impedance assay (BIA). BIA is a non-invasive method based on the principle that lean tissues conduct a low frequency alternating current of electricity better than do fatty tissues. Body mass index was increased in the alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.04), as was fat mass, (p less than 0.03) as evaluated by skin fold measurements. Bioelectric impedance assay demonstrated a slight total body water increase in alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.07). Possibly, if this total body water increase was reflected at the neuronal level, the bioelectric properties of the migrainous brain may be altered, thus creating a hypothetical link with the phenomenon of spreading depression. 
Detection of alcoholism in hospitalized children and their families The study sought to measure provider recognition of family alcohol-related problems among hospitalized children and to identify characteristics distinguishing "positive" families. The study sample (N = 147) was drawn from admissions to the general pediatric medical service of a metropolitan teaching hospital. Positivity was assessed through parent and patient interviews that included standard alcohol abuse screening instruments. Provider recognition was assessed through record review and physician interview. Of the 22 families screened positive, only one was so identified by the child's attending or resident physician. Positive and "negative" families were similar in most respects, although parents in positive families were more likely to report stress and sleeping problems and adolescents were more likely to report being troubled by a parent's drinking. The similarity of positive and negative families and the low pediatrician recognition rate suggest that alcohol problems are likely to go unnoticed without a conscious screening effort. 
Neonatal detection of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Feb 20;265(7):869] Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is an inherited disease that is usually suspected when elevated serum thyroid hormone levels are associated with nonsuppressed thyrotropin. Often these test results are obtained because of short stature, decreased intelligence, and/or hyperactivity with learning disability noted in childhood and adolescence, or because of goiter in adulthood. We detected GRTH at birth by analysis of blood obtained during routine neonatal screening. The proposita, born to a mother with GRTH, had a thyrotropin level of 26 mU/L and a corresponding thyroxine concentration of 656 nmol/L (normal, 84 to 232 nmol/L). Administration of thyroid hormone in doses eightfold to 10-fold above replacement levels (liothyronine sodium, 21 micrograms/kg per day, and levothyroxine sodium, 44 micrograms/kg per day) were required to reduce serum thyrotropin to normal levels without induction of hypermetabolism. This case, and the retrospective finding of high thyroxine levels in five newborns subsequently diagnosed as having GRTH, suggest that measurement of thyroxine at birth, in conjunction with thyrotropin, could allow the early detection of GRTH. 
Total hip replacement with cemented, uncemented, and hybrid prostheses. A comparison of clinical and radiographic results at two to four years. One hundred and thirty-one patients who had 144 cemented or uncemented hip prostheses were followed prospectively for two to four years. A cemented or a hybrid prosthesis (consisting of a cemented femoral component and an uncemented acetabular component) was used in men older than seventy years, in women older than sixty years, and in younger patients in whom adequate initial fixation could not be obtained without cement. Uncemented, porous-surfaced implants were used in all other patients. The over-all clinical results were similar for the three groups. For the fifty-two hips that had a cemented prosthesis, the mean total Harris hip rating was 91 points and the score for pain, 42 points; for the twenty-seven hips that had a hybrid prosthesis, 90 and 43 points; and for the sixty-five hips that had an implant allowing ingrowth of bone in both the acetabulum and the femur, 95 and 43 points. Two prosthetic stems that were designed to allow ingrowth of bone had aseptic loosening; one was revised. Pain in the thigh, usually slight and not disabling, occurred at one year in 24 per cent of the patients in whom a femoral component allowing ingrowth had been used; the prevalence of pain then declined. The incidences of migration of the components and of radiolucent lines were greater in the acetabula that had a cemented component than in those that had a cup allowing ingrowth of bone. 
The effect of oral nitroglycerin on portal blood velocity as measured by ultrasonic Doppler. A double blind, placebo controlled study. We studied the effect of oral nitroglycerin on portal blood velocity (PBV) in 20 cirrhotic patients by a double blind, placebo controlled method using noninvasive Doppler sonography. After we obtained baseline Doppler in the fasting state, 0.6 mg nitroglycerin or placebo was given orally and the mean of 3 s averaged mean PBVs was repeated at 5 min intervals for 60 min. Ten patients each received nitroglycerin or placebo. Portal vein flows were antegrade in all. Of the 10 patients receiving nitroglycerin, seven (P = 0.002) showed a greater than 10% fall in the mean PBVs for at least 15 min. Of these seven "responders," five patients had a 10% decrease in mean systemic blood pressure for at least 15 min. None of the "nonresponders" had systemic hypotension. Our study suggests that the PBV-reducing effect of nitroglycerin in cirrhotics may be explained in part by systemic hypotension. 
Twin delivery: influence of the presentation and method of delivery on the second twin. To ascertain the perinatal mortality and morbidity in the second twin as related to its presentation and method of delivery, we reviewed the data on 578 sets of twins delivered from 1980 to 1987 and included 397 sets in whom both twins were greater than or equal to 1000 gm, without lethal anomalies, and in whom the first twin presented as a vertex. The perinatal outcome comparing twin A (all vertex) with twin B (vertex or nonvertex) with cesarean section or vaginal delivery was analyzed. No statistically significant difference in perinatal mortality or morbidity was found in comparing the nonvertex second twin delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. The one perinatal death and significant perinatal morbidity occurred in infants weighing less than 1500 gm or at less than 32 weeks' gestational age. It is concluded that vaginal delivery, irrespective of the position of the second twin, is valid in selected cases as long as fetal weight is greater than 1500 gm and the gestational age is greater than or equal to 32 weeks. 
A phase II evaluation of menogaril in cisplatin-refractory advanced ovarian carcinoma. A collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Mayo Clinic. Forty-one women with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma (in whom prior chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen failed) were treated with menogaril 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 4 weeks in a Phase II trial. Partial responses were seen in two of 19 (10.5%) measurable disease patients and three of 12 (25%) nonmeasurable but evaluable patients, an overall objective response rate of 16.1% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 34%). Median time to progression for all patients was 2 months and median survival, 5 months. Toxicities were acceptable and consisted primarily of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had venous irritation or painful phlebitis at the intravenous injection site. Menogaril, as administered in this protocol, had modest antineoplastic activity in previously treated ovarian carcinoma patients. The responses were of short duration, and there appeared to be no survival advantage with menogaril treatment. 
The binding and functional properties of voltage dependent calcium channel receptors in pediatric normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The present study was designed to compare the binding and functional properties of calcium channel receptors in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. Normal bladders were obtained from children with vesicoureteral reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation. Myelodysplastic bladder specimens were obtained from patients undergoing bladder augmentation. The functional studies included agonist (calcium chloride) dose response experiments and the determination of apparent antagonist dissociation constants for various calcium channel antagonists. The receptor binding studies were performed using the ligand (+)-3H-PN200-110 (specific activity 86.6 Ci./mmol.). The mean maximal response of myelodysplastic bladders to calcium ions was 31% less than normal bladders (p greater than 0.05). The mean EC50 for calcium mediated isometric tension and the mean -log antagonist dissociation constant values of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil were similar in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The radioligand receptor binding studies demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant of (+)-3H-PN200-110 in myelodysplastic bladders was 4-fold greater than in normal bladders. The density of dihydropyridine binding sites in myelodysplastic and normal bladders was similar. Our study demonstrated that the pathophysiology of the poorly compliant hyperreflexic bladder is not related to up regulation of dihydropyridine calcium channel receptors or alterations in the response of detrusor muscle to calcium ions. The relative abundance of calcium channel receptors in the normal and myelodysplastic bladders, and the regulation of detrusor contraction by calcium ions suggest that calcium channel receptors have a meaningful role in detrusor function. 
IgA nephropathy in blacks: studies of IgA2 allotypes and clinical course. The prevalence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) varies among racial groups, being most common among Caucasians and Orientals and rare in Blacks. Other investigators have hypothesized that the risk for IgAN may be influenced by the IgA2 allotype. It has been suggested that the rare Black patients with IgAN may be homozygous for the A2m(1) allele which predominates in Whites, but is less common in Blacks. In a multicenter study, 27 Black IgAN patients were enrolled to investigate this hypothesis and analyze the clinical course of disease in Blacks. The IgA2 allotypes of 18 Black patients and 14 controls were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Three patients were homozygous for the A2m(1) allele, four were homozygous for A2m(2) and 11 were heterozygous. The respective allelic frequencies of A2m(1) and A2m(2) were 0.47 and 0.53 and did not differ significantly from Black controls. Most clinical manifestations of disease did not significantly differ with respect to distribution of the two alleles, although the gender ratio differed between the homozygous A2m(1) and heterozygous patients. The presence of the A2m(1) allele did not increase the risk for IgAN, and the presence of the A2m(2) allele or homozygosity for this allele did not protect Blacks from the development of IgAN. 
Coronary artery vasoregulation and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris-like pain and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty patients with angina pectoris-like pain, normal coronary angiography and abnormal exercise 201Tl scans were investigated by means of haemodynamic, coronary sinus blood flow and lactate determinations before and after cold provocation, pacing and dipyridamole infusion. Radionuclide angiography, a new exercise 201Tl scan and noninvasive hyperventilation and ergonovine tests were performed. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine were given in increasing doses and a second coronary angiogram in combination with a 201Tl scintigram was performed. Despite a previously pathological 201Tl scintigram, with reversible perfusion defects, only ten of the patients had reversible perfusion defects at the second investigation. Hyperventilation and ergonovine tests did not result in ECG signs indicative of coronary spasm. Intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine resulted in a diffuse coronary constriction in 3 of 14 patients, and in one patient a perfusion defect was observed on thallium scintigram. In conclusion, although most of the common methods for inducing coronary vasospasm were used, no consistent pattern of reaction was found to explain the chest pains experienced in this group of patients. 
Erdheim-Chester disease. Case report with autopsy findings. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare pathologic entity characterized by symmetrical radiodensities in the metaphyseal and the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. Fibrosis, osteoblastic cortical bone deposition, and fibroxanthomatous granulomas with lipid-laden macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, which have a particular tropism for connective and adipose tissues, are the pathologic hallmarks. To our knowledge, 27 cases have been reported in the literature since the entity was first described in 1930. Protean clinical features range from a focal and asymptomatic process to a multisystemic infiltrative disease. We describe the clinical course of a new case and review the extensive pathologic findings at autopsy, including those demonstrated by light and electron microscopy and cytochemical and immunocytochemical studies. 
Comparison of direct insertion of disposable and standard reusable laparoscopic trocars and previous pneumoperitoneum with Veress needle. A randomized prospective study was conducted to evaluate the ease of use and safety of direct insertion of laparoscopic trocars. Comparison of previous pneumoperitoneum by Veress needle insertion with direct insertion of the reusable conventional laparoscopic trocar and direct insertion of the disposable shielded trocar revealed minor complication rates of 22, 6 and 0%, respectively. No major complications occurred in this series of 200 patients. 
Conservative treatment of patients with acoustic tumors. Seventy of 178 patients with acoustic tumors initially were treated conservatively and have been followed up for an average of 26 +/- 2 months. The tumor size was determined by the mean maximum anteroposterior and mediolateral diameters, using computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained sequentially throughout the follow-up period. The average tumor growth was 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm the 1st year, and 1.9 +/- 1.0 mm the 2nd year (range, -2 to 17 mm/y): 4 tumors showed apparent regression, 28 (40%) had no detectable growth, and 37 (53%) exhibited growth (average, 3.8 +/- 1.2 mm/y). Within individual patients, the tumor growth rate determined during the 1st year of follow-up was predictive of tumor growth rate determined during the following year. Rapid tumor growth or clinical deterioration in 9 of the 70 patients (13%) who initially were treated conservatively necessitated subsequent surgery an average of 14 +/- 5 months after the patient was initially seen. This group had a larger initial tumor size (27.0 +/- 3.4 mm vs. 21.3 +/- 0.9 mm, P less than 0.05), and a faster 1-year growth rate (7.9 +/- 2.3 mm/y vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 mm/y, P less than 0.05) than the 61 patients who did not require surgery. Two patients, however, experienced neurological deterioration that required surgery, even though there was no tumor growth. The high incidence of acoustic tumors with no detectable growth or apparent spontaneous regression must be taken into account when evaluating the indications for surgery and the efficacy of radiotherapy. 
Superior vena cava syndrome caused by an intrathoracic plasmacytoma. A case of an extramedullary intrathoracic plasmacytoma causing superior vena cava syndrome is described. Review of the literature on intrathoracic plasmacytomas and superior vena cava syndrome revealed that no similar cases have been described to date. The initial presentation, management, and response to treatment are described. 
Effects of left atrial pressure on the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxic ventilation. We investigated the effects of hypoxic ventilation on the pulmonary arterial pressure- (P) flow (Q) relationship in an intact canine preparation. Mean pulmonary P-Q coordinates were obtained during hypoxic ventilation and during ventilation with 100% O2 at normal and at increased left atrial pressure. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that, over a wide range, changes in left atrial pressure would alter the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics. Seven dogs were studied. When left atrial pressure was normal (5 mmHg), the mean value of the extrapolated intercept (PI) of the linear P-Q relationship was 10.9 mmHg and the slope (incremental vascular resistance, IR) of the P-Q relationship was 2.2 mmHg.l-1.min. Hypoxic ventilation increased PI to 18 mmHg (P less than 0.01) but did not affect IR. Subsequently, during ventilation with 100% O2, when left atrial pressure was increased to 14 mmHg by inflation of left atrial balloon, PI increased to 18 mmHg. IR was 1.6 mmHg.l-1.min. Again, hypoxic ventilation caused an isolated change in PI. Hypoxia increased PI from 18 to 28 mmHg (P less than 0.01). As in the condition of normal left atrial pressure, hypoxic ventilation did not affect IR. We conclude that, in an anesthetized intact canine preparation, hypoxic ventilation causes an isolated increase in the extrapolated pressure intercept of the pulmonary P-Q relationship. Furthermore the effects of hypoxic ventilation on pulmonary P-Q characteristics are not affected by the resting left atrial pressure. 
Detection of autoantibodies against myeloid lysosomal enzymes: a useful adjunct to classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. PURPOSE: Assessment of the value of determination of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and its specificities for classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The serum samples of 28 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven vasculitis involving medium- and/or small-sized arteries were tested for ANCA by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, by neutrophil extract enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and by catching ELISA. RESULTS: Eight patients had Churg-Strauss syndrome; six had myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, and in the other two patients, ANCA were not detected. Six patients had polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system; ANCA were not detected in these patients. Two patients had systemic PAN and both had MPO antibodies. The remaining 12 patients had overlapping clinical features of the different forms of vasculitis. Five patients had polyarteritis in combination with chronic nasal inflammation and glomerulonephritis compatible with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) but without granulomas in the respiratory tract. All five patients had 29-kd serine protease antibodies. Two patients had polyarteritis in combination with nasal polyposis and asthma compatible with Churg-Strauss syndrome, but eosinophilia was not detected. Both patients had MPO antibodies. Three patients with unclassified granulomatous arteritis had either elastase antibodies or ANCA of unknown specificity. One patient with unclassified systemic vasculitis had 29-kd serine protease antibodies, and one patient with necrotizing arteritis of the bowel in combination with Schonlein-Henoch purpura was negative for ANCA. CONCLUSION: Determination of ANCA and its specificities is a useful adjunct to the classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. Within the spectrum of idiopathic vasculitides, 29-kd serine protease antibodies are associated with WG, MPO antibodies are associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome and systemic PAN, and PAN limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system is not associated with ANCA. 
Current status of lung transplantation. Techniques and indications for single and bilateral lung transplantation have evolved significantly in the past several years. Lung transplantation has entered a new era in which transplantation can be achieved with the same degree of success as that achieved with other major organ transplants. Many problems, common to organ transplantation remain to be solved including availability of suitable donor organs, improved immunosuppressive regimens, and the ability to properly diagnose and effectively treat organ rejection. 
Five-year vascular audit from a district hospital. Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard. Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died. Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations. An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high. With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged. 
Clinical characteristics of patients in the persistent vegetative state Little is known concerning the specific clinical characteristics of patients in persistent vegetative states (PVS). Fifty-one patients from four nursing homes, approximately 3% of the total patients, were identified as being in a PVS. The mean age of the patients was 64.8 +/- 3.2 years (range, 19 to 96 years) and the mean duration of the PVS was 3.3 +/- 5.0 years (range, 1 to 16.8 years), with 13 patients' PVS being longer than 5 years. Cerebrovascular accidents and dementia were the most common causes of the PVS, accounting for 32 of the cases (63%). In the younger patients cerebral trauma secondary to motor vehicle accidents was the most common cause. All 51 patients were fed via tube feeding and 35 patients had urinary catheters (75%). All patients were receiving daily medications, with greater than 50% taking daily vitamins. Over 30% were taking digitalis and/or diuretics and over 32% were taking H2 blockers. Transfer of patients to an acute care hospital was not uncommon, with 31 patients (61%) requiring 63 acute care hospitalizations during their stay in the nursing home. As expected, infections were the most common reason for acute care hospitalization, although 15 of the patients were hospitalized for surgical procedures. Another common problem encountered by the patients was pressure sores, with 78% of patients requiring specific therapy for at least one pressure sore. Surprisingly, only 27 (53%) of 51 patients had a specific resuscitation status designation in the medical chart, and neither presence of a chart designation nor specific resuscitation order was related to the patient's age or the cause or duration of PVS. From these data it would appear that clinical characteristics of patients in PVS are variable. Some patients are young, others are old. The cause varies from cerebrovascular accidents to cerebral trauma. Survival may be prolonged; complications are not uncommon, with some patients requiring acute care hospitalization. 
Attenuation of circadian variation by combined antianginal therapy with suppression of morning and evening increases in transient myocardial ischemia. The circadian variation of total ischemic activity was examined during 3289 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring in 101 patients with stable angina pectoris and proved coronary artery disease, who were not receiving any prophylactic antianginal therapy. The 101 patients displayed 411 episodes of ischemia, 312 (76%) of which were silent; a circadian rhythm was noted for the occurrence of total and silent ischemia. Thirty-eight percent of the ischemic episodes occurred between 6 AM and 12 noon, and total and silent ischemia were significantly more frequent during this period compared with the other three 6-hour periods (p less than 0.01); a lesser peak was noted in the evening. The effects of metoprolol and combined therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine on the circadian variation of ischemic activity were studied in two subgroups of patients in a random, double-blind study design (31 patients receiving metoprolol and 42 receiving combined therapy). During therapy with metoprolol the morning increase in ischemic activity was attenuated, and the highest frequency of ischemia was then noted in the evening (6 AM to 12 noon compared with 6 PM to 12 midnight; p less than 0.05). Combined therapy abolished the morning peak as did metoprolol monotherapy, but even the evening increase in ischemic activity was attenuated (p less than 0.05). The diurnal distribution of the mean heart rate at the onset of ischemia, when patients were off therapy, showed a morning increase similar to the increase in ischemic activity but no second peak in the evening. 
Hereditary lymphedema and distichiasis. Two patients with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome illustrate that both Milroy's disease and late-onset hereditary lymphedema are sometimes associated with distichiasis. It is important for ophthalmologists to be aware of the lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome because of its ophthalmic manifestations and the associated systemic abnormalities that can be potentially life threatening. 
Management of hypertensive emergencies: changing therapeutic options. Rapid lowering of severe hypertension is essential to prevent irreversible damage to vital organs. The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions. Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences. It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects. Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects. Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure. Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. 
Preparing children for venous blood sampling. A convenience sample of 100 children, aged 6-12 years, attending Kuwait government hospital laboratories for venous blood sampling was studied. A picture book was used to prepare half of the children for the procedure. Preparation was carried out just prior to sampling and took less than 5 min. The story provided a simple description of venous blood sampling, and why it is carried out; it stressed that the pain is noticeable but not unbearable, and that children will experience less pain if they relax their arm and cooperate with the technician. Prepared children reported significantly less pain, and radial pulse rates confirmed that they were less distressed by the procedure. Observers' and parents' evaluations also indicated that prepared children coped better. Various explanations for the benefits observed are discussed, together with requirements for managing the pain, fear and stress experienced by children during medical treatment. 
Relationship between outlet obstruction constipation and obstructed urinary flow. Ten women with symptoms and radiological features of outlet obstruction constipation underwent urodynamic bladder studies. The results were compared with ten age- and sex-matched controls. The mean (s.e.m.) peak flow rate for patients was 19.4 (6.4) ml/s compared with 32.1 (7.2) ml/s for controls (P less than 0.05). The mean (s.e.m.) voiding time for patients was 62.9 (23.7) s against a corresponding value of 15.6 (6) for controls (P less than 0.05). The mean (s.e.m.) bladder volume in patients was 482 (80) ml compared with a control value of 254 (112) ml (P less than 0.03). The mean (s.e.m.) detrusor pressure during the voiding phase was 53.3 (12) cmH2O. These results demonstrate that patients with outlet obstruction constipation have a generalized pelvic floor disorder resulting in obstructed urinary flow. 
Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. A report of three cases. Three cases of peritoneal cystic mesothelioma are reported. All patients were women who had undergone previous abdominal surgery for unrelated conditions. Tumors consisted of solitary and multiple cystic masses involving the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum. The cysts focally infiltrated the muscularis externa of the small intestine in case 1, the outer muscular layer of the uterus in case 2, and the omental tissue in case 3. These findings give morphologic support to the borderline clinical behavior of this tumor that often recurs and support the hypothesis that previous surgery may play a role in its pathogenesis. 
Surgery for chronic ear disease in a non-university hospital: open cavity, obliteration and intact canal wall techniques. The long-term results of surgery for chronic suppurative middle ear disease at a non-university ENT-clinic (Vasa Central Hospital, Finland) are reported. The material consisted of 273 ears, 65 of which had been operated on by open cavity techniques, 178 by the original Palva obliteration method, and 30 by the intact canal wall method. Post-operative cholesteatoma occurred equally frequently with the two canal wall down methods (7.7 and 7.3%, respectively) but was more frequent after intact canal wall surgery (23.3%). Hearing was better and the infection rate lower with obliteration than with open cavity techniques. Post-operative infection was the least frequent and the hearing result best in the intact canal wall ears, but compared to the other two groups the extent of disease found at surgery was considerably less in this group. The obliteration operation proved to be a safe method in the hands of a practising otologist outside university clinics. 
Establishment and characterization of a new human prostatic carcinoma cell line (DuPro-1). A new human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (DuPro-1) has been established from the athymic nude mouse supported xenograft DU5683. This was accomplished by embedding dispersed xenograft cells in 0.1 by 5.0 cm. spaghetti-like strands of Basement Membrane MATRIGEL [BMM (Collaborative Research, Inc.)], a unique technique facilitating the transition to tissue culture. Now passed over 30 times, the cells display anchorage and serum concentration independent growth with a doubling time of 22 to 24 hours. Cells exhibit pronounced morphological differences when grown on BMM coated culture dishes, assuming a pseudoglandular configuration, in contrast to typical homogeneous monolayer growth on plastic culture dishes. Light and electron microscopy show cohesive sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells, consistent with prostate carcinoma. Karyotypic analysis revealed all human chromosomes, near tetraploidy, 10 to 12 markers, and 3 to 4 X chromosomes, without a Y chromosome. Cells injected s.c. or embedded in BMM and implanted in the subrenal capsule space are equally tumorigenic in male and female athymic mice, suggesting that DuPro-1 cells are hormonally insensitive. Embedding cells in BMM may be useful in developing other tissue culture cell lines from neoplasms difficult to initiate in vitro. DuPro-1 should provide a valuable means to study the biology, immunology, and chemosensitivity of human prostate cancer. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
The early management of flap necrosis in breast reconstruction. Flap necrosis is a potential complication of any type of breast reconstruction. Of 302 breast reconstructions performed by the author at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, some degree of flap necrosis occurred in 59 (19.5 percent). Small areas of flap necrosis can be managed with simple observation, but secondary healing may not be complete for months. Early and aggressive excision of the ischemic tissue with immediate primary closure often can achieve rapid primary healing. In addition, early revision and reshaping of the breast may, in selected patients, permit achievement of a significantly better final result. This is true not only for TRAM and latissimus dorsi flaps, but also for the mastectomy flap necrosis sometimes encountered in immediate reconstruction with simple implants or tissue expanders. 
Monthly pulses of vincristine and prednisone prevent bone marrow and testicular relapse in low-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of the CCG-161 study by the Childrens Cancer Study Group. On study CCG-161 of the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG), 631 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at low risk for relapse were randomized to receive monthly pulses of vincristine-prednisone (VCR-PDN ) during maintenance therapy in addition to standard therapy with mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), and either cranial irradiation during consolidation or intrathecal (IT) MTX every 3 months during maintenance. All patients received six doses of IT MTX during induction and consolidation. With a minimum follow-up time of 4.25 years, 76.7% receiving VCR-PDN were in continuous complete remission at 5 years, in contrast to 63.9% receiving GMP-MTX alone (P = .002). The difference in relapse-free survival was due primarily to bone marrow relapse (P = .0008), and in boys also to testicular relapse (P = .003). Among the nonirradiated patients, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79.4% for patients randomized to the VCR-PDN pulses, in contrast to 61.2% for the patients randomized to receive 6MP-MTX alone (P = .0002). Among the irradiated patients, the DFS was not significantly different. Of the four combinations of maintenance and CNS therapy studied, the highest DFS was achieved with VCR-PDN pulses and maintenance IT MTX. 
Expression of the insulin like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) gene is increased in human renal carcinomas. After we had established that the IGFBP-3 gene is expressed in normal human kidney we examined renal adenocarcinoma tissue for alterations of the expression of this gene. For this purpose we prepared poly(A)+ RNA from normal kidney tissue and adjacent renal adenocarcinoma of 18 adult patients and compared the levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA by Northern analysis in both samples. The mean content by densitometry was markedly increased in the carcinoma tissues; in 17 of 18 patients the carcinoma contained significantly more IGFBP-3 mRNA than the normal kidney sample. The highest mRNA levels were found in patients with N2 and N3 lymph node extensions. Comparative Southern analysis of paired samples of four of these patients did not reveal amplification of the gene as the cause of these increased mRNA levels. In one patient, however, we identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) present in normal and malignant cellular DNA. This suggests a participation of the IGFBP-3 gene in the development of human renal cell cancer. 
A difference in mortality between two strains of jaundiced rats. Homozygous Gunn rats lack bilirubin glucuronyltransferase, become jaundiced, and often develop kernicterus, thus providing a model for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Two new, inbred rat strains that carry the Gunn mutation are described. These were developed by breeding the mutant Gunn gene (j) into the RHA/N and ACI/N strains, producing the new lines, which were designated RHA/N-j and ACI/N-j. Liver assay confirmed the absence of transferase activity in jaundiced rats from both of the new strains, but marked differences in mortality between the strains were observed. The mortality of jaundiced RHA/N-j rats through 8 weeks was the same as that of their nonjaundiced littermates (20%). In contrast, mortality of jaundiced ACI/N-j rats was distinctly greater than that of their nonjaundiced littermates (81% vs 34%, P less than .001). Signs of kernicterus such as ataxia were much more frequent in jaundiced ACI/N-j rats than in jaundiced RHA/N-j rats (73% vs 11%, P less than .001). Both strains had comparable albumin concentrations through 8 weeks of age. Serum bilirubin concentrations were also comparable, except for a small but significant difference at 20 days of age (ACI/N-j = 294 mumols/L, RHA/N-j = 248 mumols/L, P less than .01). Similarly, the bilirubin-to-albumin ratios were comparable except for a significantly higher ratio at 20 days of age in the ACI/N-j rats (ACI/N-j = 0.70, RHA/N-j = 0.51, P less than .01). Thus, the RHA/N-j strain is unusual in that the jaundiced animals remain healthy. Conversely, the ACI/N-j animals demonstrate a high incidence of kernicterus with mortality. 
Asymptomatic bacterascites: is it spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Asymptomatic bacterascites is defined as the presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid without clinical features of peritonitis or increased ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells. Asymptomatic bacterascites is a controversial entity, and little information is available regarding its spontaneous evolution. Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid. Peritonitis rarely develops in patients with asymptomatic bacterascites and, in most of them, antibiotic therapy is not required. 
Fetal hypertension induced by norepinephrine infusion and umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal sheep. This study was designed to examine the effects of fetal hypertension on the umbilical artery pulsatility index. Fetal arterial blood pressure and umbilical venous pressure were measured in eight sheep, 3 to 5 days after surgery. Umbilical blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter around the common umbilical vein. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained either by an indwelling 5 MHz pulsed Doppler device (n = 4) or transcutaneously by a 4 MHz continuous-wave Doppler device (n = 4). Fetal blood pressure was raised by intravenous infusion of norepinephrine 10 micrograms/min during 5 minutes. Norepinephrine infusion resulted in elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures, accompanied by a bradycardia during the first 3 minutes. Umbilical blood flow, calculated placental vascular resistance, and umbilical artery pulsatility index did not change. After atropine administration, the norepinephrine-induced elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures were accompanied by tachycardia, increased umbilical blood flow, and no change in placental vascular resistance and umbilical artery pulsatility index. It is concluded that fetal arterial hypertension provoked by norepinephrine infusion has no effect on placental vascular resistance, umbilical blood flow, and umbilical artery pulsatility index. 
Prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma with pulmonary metastases. Pituitary adenomas rarely are metastatic. Extracranial visceral metastases of prolactinomas were not previously reported. The authors report a case of a 34-year-old man with a prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma and histologically proven lung metastases. Pathologic examination of the pulmonary spread included electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry; these confirmed prolactin production by the tumor. The patient's presentation at initial diagnosis, disease recurrence, clinical course, management, and response to therapy (with its theoretic basis) are detailed. Despite the use of dopamine analogues (to tolerance and in combination), there was documented intracranial and extracranial disease progression. Possible future therapeutic maneuvers are discussed. 
Renal pelvic explosion during conservative management of upper tract urothelial cancer. Ureteroscopic fulguration of a renal pelvic papillary transitional cell carcinoma is a relatively new and limited procedure. We present a case of intrarenal explosion during ureteroscopic fulguration. 
Cutaneous vasomotor sensitivity to ethanol and acetaldehyde: subtypes of alcohol-flushing response among Chinese. A cutaneous test has been applied in examination of the flushing response to ethanol and acetaldehyde in 402 Chinese of Han ethnicity. Using this noninvasive method, five response subtypes have been observed: (A) fast flushing to both ethanol and acetaldehyde; (B) fast flushing only to ethanol but not to acetaldehyde; (C) slow flushing to ethanol only; (D) no response either to ethanol or to acetaldehyde; (E) vasoconstriction to ethanol, or to both ethanol and acetaldehyde. A total of 94% in subtype (A) are reported to be flushers, while only 25% was reported in subtype (D). Other physiological responses, such as tachycardia, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and nausea are less frequent after alcohol ingestion. The recent history of consumption of alcohol of the subjects in different subtypes was also obtained. Although alcohol-induced flushing is thought to be a deterrent factor to heavy consumption of alcohol, the frequency of drinking of alcoholic beverages was not found to be different between flushers and nonflushers. 
Parental occupations of children with leukaemia in west Cumbria, north Humberside, and Gateshead OBJECTIVE--To determine whether parental occupations and chemical and other specific exposures are risk factors for childhood leukaemia. DESIGN--Case-control study. Information on parents was obtained by home interview. SETTING--Three areas in north England: Copeland and South Lakeland (west Cumbria); Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Holderness (north Humberside), and Gateshead. SUBJECTS--109 children aged 0-14 born and diagnosed as having leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in study areas during 1974-88. Two controls matched for sex and date and district of birth were obtained for each child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Occupations of parents and specific exposure of parents before the children's conception, during gestation, and after birth. Other adults living with the children were included in the postnatal analysis. RESULTS--Few risk factors were identified for mothers, although preconceptional association with the food industry was significantly increased in case mothers (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.00). Significant associations were found between childhood leukaemia and reported preconceptional exposure of fathers to wood dust (2.73, 1.44 to 5.16), radiation (3.23, 1.36 to 7.72), and benzene (5.81, 1.67 to 26.44); ionising radiation alone gave an odds ratio of 2.35 (0.92 to 6.22). Raised odds ratios were found for paternal exposure during gestation, but no independent postnatal effect was evident. CONCLUSION--These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small numbers, overlap with another study, and multiple exposure of some parents. It is important to distinguish periods of parental exposures; identified risk factors were almost exclusively restricted to the time before the child's birth. 
L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. This report describes three Belgian cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the use of L-tryptophan-containing products. Three women, aged 51, 53 and 73 years, were taking L-tryptophan for 2 months to 2 years, at 500, 1500, and 2250 mg d-1, respectively. All developed disabling myalgias, fatigue, and a variable skin rash, in association with marked eosinophilia. In one patient, symptoms and eosinophilia reappeared after rechallenge with L-tryptophan. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in gradual disappearance of the symptoms, signs and laboratory abnormalities in two patients. One patient was treated with corticosteroids because of persisting myalgias. Because of the non-specific clinical manifestations, clinicians from all subspecialties of internal medicine might be confronted with such patients and should be aware of this new entity. 
Mitral valve prolapse, panic disorder, and chest pain. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac disorder that can readily be diagnosed by characteristic auscultatory and echocardiographic criteria. Although many diseases have been associated with mitral valve prolapse, most affected individuals have the primary form of the disorder. Mitral valve prolapse is an inherited condition commonly associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and its support structures. Complications of mitral valve prolapse, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, infective endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation (with or without chordae tendineae rupture), and cerebral ischemic events, occur infrequently considering the wide prevalence of the disorder. Panic disorder is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by at least three panic attacks within a 3-week period or one panic attack followed by fear of subsequent panic attacks for at least 1 month. It too is a common condition with a prevalence and age and gender distribution similar to that of mitral valve prolapse. Panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse share many nonspecific symptoms, including chest pain or discomfort, palpitations, dyspnea, effort intolerance, and pre-syncope. Chest pain is the symptom in both conditions that most commonly brings the patient to medical attention. The clinical description of chest pain in patients with mitral valve prolapse is highly variable, possibly reflecting multiple etiologies. Chest pain in panic disorder is usually characterized as atypical angina pectoris and as such bears resemblance to the chest pain commonly described by patients with mitral valve prolapse. Multiple investigative attempts to elucidate the mechanism of chest pain in both conditions have failed to identify a unifying cause. Review of the literature leaves little doubt that mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder frequently co-occur. Given the similarities in their symptomatology, a high rate of co-occurrence is, in fact, entirely predictable. There is, however, no convincing evidence of a cause-effect relationship between the two disorders, nor has a single pathophysiologic or biochemical mechanism been identified that unites these two common conditions. Until specific biologic markers for these disorders are identified, it may be impossible to do so. The lack of a proven cause-and-effect relationship between mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder and the absence of a unifying mechanism do not diminish the clinical significance of the high rate of co-occurrence between the two conditions. Primary care physicians and cardiologists frequently encounter patients with mitral valve prolapse and nonspecific symptoms with no discernible objective cause who fail to respond to beta-blockade. Panic disorder should be considered as a possible explanation for symptoms in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Induction of the protooncogene c-fos and recovery of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate in reperfused liver after transient warm ischemia: effect of nitrone free-radical spin-trap agents. Ischemia and reperfusion stimulate several adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent processes involving release of substances including free radicals. This cellular response is mediated through receptors responsive to transcriptional products of gene expression; c-fos acts as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that nitrone free-radical spin traps promote restoration of cytosolic ATP during reperfusion and prevent c-fos induction. Four control rats had no ischemia. Global hepatic ischemia was induced in 19 rats in four groups: saline solution, phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), alpha 1-pyridyl-N-oxide N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). ATP and intracellular pH were measured at intervals before, during, and after ischemia. At 90 minutes of reperfusion, liver c-fos mRNA was measured. A fourfold elevation of c-fos occurred in the saline-treated group (p less than 0.001). PBN and POBN groups did not differ from the saline group. DMPO resulted in significantly less induction of c-fos than did NS. ATP depletion and recovery in all treatment groups was similar to that of the saline group. We conclude that (1) nitrone spin traps do not prevent c-fos induction or alter the pattern of ATP recovery after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and (2) c-fos induction is not necessary for restoration of ATP, but the rate of ATP restoration is inversely related to c-fos induction. 
Localization of the translocation breakpoint in a female with Menkes syndrome to Xq13.2-q13.3 proximal to PGK-1. Menkes syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize copper. A female patient with both this disease and an X; autosome translocation with karyotype 46,X,t(X;2)(q13;q32.2) has previously been described. The translocation breakpoint in Xq13 coincides with a previous assignment of the Menkes gene at Xq13 by linkage data in humans and by analogy to the mottled mutations which are models for Menkes disease in the mouse. Therefore, this translocation probably interrupts the gene for Menkes syndrome in band Xq13. We describe here experiments to precisely map the translocation breakpoint within this chromosomal band. We have established a lymphoblastoid cell line from this patient and have used it to isolate the der(2) translocation chromosome (2pter----2q32::Xq13----Xqter) in human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. Southern blot analyses using a number of probes specific for chromosomes X and 2 have been studied to define precisely the location of the translocation breakpoint. Our results show that the breakpoint in this patient--and, therefore, likely the Menkes gene--maps to a small subregion of band Xq13.2-q13.3 proximal to the PGK1 locus and distal to all other Xq13 loci tested. 
Solitary extradural cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. Report of five cases. Five cases of solitary extrathecal cavernous hemangioma in the spinal canal are reported. In one case, two coexistent massive cerebral venous medullary malformations were found. The symptomatology and prognosis of extrathecal spinal cavernous hemangiomas are discussed, as is the significance of various diagnostic measures. The patient material further permitted a rough calculation of the incidence of symptomatic extrathecal cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. 
Transesophageal echocardiography: a simple method for monitoring the patency of ventriculoatrial shunts. Technical note. A new method for evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt is described, and early experience with it is reported. Transesophageal echocardiography can demonstrate a cerebrospinal fluid leak in the right atrium through the atrial tip of a shunting device. This capability was an incidental discovery, and since then the accuracy of the technique in evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt has been prospectively studied in 20 observations of 16 patients. The method proved to be accurate in 90% to 100% of cases. It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography offers a rapid and accurate assessment of ventriculoatrial shunt function, is well tolerated, and is easy to perform. 
Heterotopic ossification and peripheral nerve entrapment: early diagnosis and excision. Heterotopic ossification can occur in neurologic disorders, burns, musculoskeletal trauma, and metabolic disorders. In addition to producing the complications of contracture, skin breakdown, and pain, it can cause peripheral nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification may be misdiagnosed, and it is difficult to evaluate and treat without recurrence. Computed tomography is especially useful in localization before surgical release of the entrapped nerve. Resection of heterotopic ossification can be successful using disodium etidronate to decrease the risk of recurrence, and resection can improve range of motion and nerve function. Two case studies of nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification are presented with the results of computed tomography localization, successful resection, and long-term follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential for rapid nerve injury. If heterotopic ossification is causing clinically significant peripheral nerve entrapment, early surgical treatment may be indicated, and may be successful. 
The effect of chronic orthopedic infection on quality of life. The patient with chronic orthopedic infection presents a unique challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon must not only possess an expertise in constantly evolving diagnostic and treatment techniques but also be able to identify numerous related problems and direct the patient in receiving the most appropriate treatment. This demands a commitment of time by the treating surgeon to the individual patient to properly assess the need for support, the extent of psychologic distress, the intensity of pain, and the requirement for medication management. The effective utilization of a multidisciplinary team of health care providers (e.g., specialists in infectious disease, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, nursing, pharmacology) can provide an optimal treatment program for this multifaceted problem and maximize the potential for a favorable outcome. 
Cellular energy metabolism during hypoxia. Tissue hypoxia is frequently seen in critically ill patients and it perhaps predisposes these patients to development of multiple system organ failure. In cellular terms, hypoxia is characterized by decreases in the intracellular concentration of oxygen, leading to a decline in aerobically produced adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The deficit arising from unequal levels of cellular ATP requirements and aerobic ATP production is partially satisfied by anaerobic sources of ATP, including glycolysis, the creatine kinase reaction, and the adenylate kinase reaction. These reactions can set in motion cellular mechanisms that ultimately may lead to cellular dysfunction and death. A clear understanding of the relative importance of these reactions is impossible to acquire from global measures of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption; therefore, the clinical monitoring of tissue oxygenation also should include the measurement of metabolically relevant, organ-specific variables. 
Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) surgery 1978-1990. A series of 151 patients with 154 acoustic schwannomas have been operated upon in Manchester Royal Infirmary by a joint Otological and Neurosurgical team, employing either the translabyrinthine or the suboccipital approach. The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases. Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively. Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent). The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons. A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed. The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. II. Clinical manifestations and syndromes. During a 4-year period 1984 to 1988, 20 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were found to have a mitochondrial disease. Each diagnosis was based on the results of thorough biochemical and morphologic investigations. The patients were separated into one series with mainly encephalopathy (n = 14) and another with mainly myopathy (n = 6). The patients with encephalopathy had the following syndromes: Kearns-Sayre (n = 2), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; n = 2), MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; n = 3), Alpers (n = 3), Leigh (n = 1), and other variants (n = 3). In patients with myopathy, three had hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria were the most common morphologic changes in the muscle biopsies. Complex I deficiency was most common in the patients with encephalopathy. All of the patients with myopathy had complex IV deficiency. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA were found in six patients with encephalopathy. We conclude that identification of defects at the DNA level and determination of the phenotypic expression with clinical, morphologic, and biochemical methods are fundamental for future rational classification of mitochondrial disorders. 
Cervicomedullary junction decompression in a case of Marshall-Smith syndrome. Case report. The case is reported of a 2-year-old boy born with Marshall-Smith syndrome who had difficulty in swallowing and who exhibited spasticity and quadriparesis due to compression of the medulla and cervical spine. This is the first child with this rare condition reported to have brain-stem compression from bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction and who has required surgery. 
Histological and morphometrical indicators for a biopsy diagnosis of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Among 597 patients with nodular hepatic lesions who underwent ultrasonically guided needle biopsy, 305 were histologically confirmed as having hepatocellular carcinoma, and 37 patients had borderline lesions. Histological reexamination was correlated with morphometrical analysis on selected cases of well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 29), borderline lesion (n = 10), typical (mid-sized and macrotrabecular) hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 15) and cirrhotic liver tissue obtained from extranodular hepatic parenchyma of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n = 47). Morphometrical analyses revealed that the mean cell size and nucleocytoplasmic ratio were most useful for distinguishing well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis. These two parameters were well correlated with nuclear density. The grade of nuclear density, therefore, seemed to be a convenient semiquantitative indicator for diagnosing well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. A comparison between intranodular and extranodular hepatic tissues was particularly important for its assessment. It is concluded from the results that hepatic nodules presenting a nuclear density larger than two times that of controls could be classified into the overt hepatocellular carcinoma group. From the statistical aspect, the possibility of microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered when a nodule has a nuclear density exceeding 1.3 times that of the extranodular tissue. 
Pure akinesia: an atypical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy. Two patients with "pure akinesia" who showed the characteristic changes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at necropsy are described. They had akinesia but no rigidity or tremor, and ophthalmoplegia was not observed during the course of illness. The symptoms of "pure akinesia" was not improved by levodopa therapy but was considerably improved by L-threo-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylserine. At necropsy, pathological findings were not different from those reported for PSP. It is suggested that "pure akinesia" is an atypical manifestation of PSP, and that norepinephrinergic neurons may be involved in some types of PSP. 
Catalase-negative listeria monocytogenes causing meningitis in an adult. Clinical and laboratory features. A 63-year-old previously healthy woman presented with acute meningitis. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded a serotype 1/2a isolate of Listeria monocytogenes that was biochemically typical in all respects, other than the reproducible lack of catalase production. During therapy, the patient developed oculomotor dysfunction that was attributed to an abscess in the internal capsule. This case report documents the existence of catalase-negative L. monocytogenes indicating that catalase production should not be a strict criterion for identification of Listeria. Furthermore, this clinical experience extends in vitro and experimental animal studies indicating that catalase production is not a necessary virulence factor for invasion by Listeria. 
Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. 
Limited hepatic resection for selected cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma: a prospective study. From 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1989 123 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 122) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) were screened using liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein determination, ultrasonography with biopsy (and in selected cases computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance), laparoscopy and angiography, Child-Pugh classification and urea-nitrogen synthesis rate. Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients. 
Clinical and biologic features of childhood T-cell leukemia with the t(11;14). Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 622 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and successful G-banding chromosome studies disclosed seven cases with the t(11;14)(p13;q11) and one with the t(11;14)(p15;q11). Leukemia cells in all eight cases had a T-cell immunophenotype. The t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurred in 6.8% and the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in 1% of T-cell ALL cases (n = 103). The t(11;14) was associated with presenting clinical features typical of T-cell ALL: male predominance (n = 6), age greater than 10 years (n = 3), hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, n = 5), relatively high hemoglobin level (median, 10.8 g/dL), high serum lactic dehydrogenase level (median, 3248 U/L), presence of mediastinal mass (n = 6), and central nervous system leukemia (n = 2). While there were no significant differences in presenting features between T-cell ALL cases with or without the t(11;14), leukemic cells from patients with the translocations were more likely to coexpress CD4 and CD8 antigens (6 of 6 v 35 of 86 cases tested, P less than .05). Adverse events have occurred in six patients: three central nervous system relapses [including the one with t(11;14)(p15;q11)], two secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and one hematologic relapse. Our results indicate that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurs exclusively in T-cell malignancies of intermediate- or late-stage thymocyte differentiation. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of these translocations. 
Spinal leptomeningeal metastasis from cerebral glioblastoma. Appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. A case of circumferential leptomeningeal metastasis to the spinal cord from an intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (spinal meningeal gliomatosis) is presented. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features are described. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid accurately demonstrated the spread of disease when compared with autopsy findings. The value of spinal magnetic resonance imaging in patients with symptoms attributable to cerebrospinal fluid metastases is discussed. 
Supravalvar aortic stenosis: a 29-year review of surgical experience Between February 1960 and August 1989, 73 consecutive patients underwent surgical correction for supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) at the Texas Heart Institute. There were 43 male (59%) and 30 female patients (41%) ranging in age from 5 days to 27 years (mean age, 12 years). Preoperatively, 8 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 43 in class II, 18 in class III, and 4 in class IV. Of the 73 patients, 62 had localized SVAS and 11 (15%), diffuse SVAS. For all procedures, patients were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Those with localized SVAS were successfully treated with patch aortoplasty, whereas those with diffuse SVAS required either an apicoaortic conduit or extensive end-arterectomy with extended patch aortoplasty. There were eight early deaths (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) (11%) and four late deaths (greater than 30 days postoperatively) (6%) in a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 28 years. Sixteen patients (25%) underwent one or more additional operations in the follow-up period. Postoperatively, there were 44 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I and 17 in class II. Preoperative functional class III and class IV (p less than 0.0005), diffuse SVAS (p = 0.05), and the presence of associated congenital defects (p less than 0.01) were important determinants of death. 
Visual evoked potentials and visual acuity after transurethral resection of the prostate. Changes in visual evoked potentials, visual acuity, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolytes (Na+ and K+) after transurethral resection of the prostate using glycine as an irrigating fluid performed under subarachnoid block were studied in 12 patients, in the pre-operative and immediate postoperative periods. Visual evoked potentials (p100 latency), recorded by shift of a checkerboard pattern, increased significantly from a pre-operative value of mean (SEM) 101.18 (1.63) msec in the right eye, and 102.5 (1.47) msec in the left eye to 108.91 (1.8) msec (p less than 0.01) and 108.08 (2.53) msec (p less than 0.01) respectively in the postoperative phase. There were no changes in visual acuity as assessed by a Snellen's chart, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolyte concentrations. The amount of glycine used intra-operatively for irrigation ranged from 3 to 31 litres. 
Alzheimer's disease with delusions and hallucinations: neuropsychological and electroencephalographic correlates. We longitudinally evaluated the neuropsychological functions, rate of progression, and waking EEG findings in 17 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) with delusions and hallucinations, and compared them with those of matched AD patients without delusions and hallucinations. AD patients with delusions and hallucinations had a more rapid rate of decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, a specific defect in receptive language, and a greater frequency of aggression and hostility. Visual EEG analysis showed that these patients had a significantly greater proportion of moderately abnormal EEGs, and spectral analysis confirmed the increased amount of delta and theta activity. These data demonstrate that AD patients with delusions and hallucinations have a greater degree of cerebral dysfunction and a relatively focal neuropsychological defect, which may indicate a localized pathologic abnormality. 
Williams syndrome: masseter spasm during anaesthesia. A 4-year-old boy with Williams syndrome developed masseter spasm after halothane and suxamethonium. He did not develop malignant hyperthermia; the surgery was accomplished with a nontriggering anaesthetic and no further problems. 
Inappropriate use of transillumination for breast cancer screening--Wisconsin, 1990. The overall effectiveness of early breast cancer detection efforts requires the appropriate use and maintenance of dedicated radiographic mammography systems. However, the effectiveness of early detection efforts can be compromised if proven technology is improperly used and/or maintained or if ineffective technology is successfully marketed as an equivalent or superior alternative to mammography. This report summarizes state and federal responses to the inappropriate use of a nonradiographic imaging technique in a breast cancer screening service advertised and used in Wisconsin in 1990. 
Thallium stress testing does not predict cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. PURPOSE: This study assessed the usefulness of thallium stress testing as a predictor of perioperative cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. Demographic factors influencing the exercise performance in these patients were also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 189 consecutive patients with diabetic nephropathy who were evaluated for cadaveric renal transplantation were reviewed. Thallium stress testing was the initial examination of cardiovascular status in 141 patients. An adequate examination was one in which at least 70% of maximum heart rate was achieved. A thallium stress test was normal if there were no ST segment depressions on the electrocardiogram and no perfusion abnormalities on the thallium scan. Forty-four patients underwent cardiac catheterization as the initial evaluation (Group C) and four patients underwent transplantation without a formal cardiovascular evaluation (Group D). RESULTS: Sixty-four of the 141 patients undergoing thallium stress testing had an adequate and normal examination (Group A). The incidence of perioperative cardiac events in this group was 2%. Seventy-seven patients (Group B) had an abnormal (n = 41) or an inadequate (n = 36) thallium stress test and most (n = 61) then underwent coronary angiography. The use of beta-blockers was the only predictor of an abnormal or inadequate thallium stress test (10 of 64 versus 27 of 77, chi 2 = 6.66, p less than or equal to 0.025). Forty-three percent (26 of 61 in Group B) of patients with inadequate or abnormal thallium stress tests had significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. The perioperative risk of cardiac events was not different in Group A versus Groups B, C, and D combined. Survival of Group A and B patients was not different but was significantly longer than that of Group C patients (p less than 0.001). Thallium stress testing was less expensive than cardiac catheterization ($1,000 versus $4,000 to $5,000). CONCLUSIONS: Thallium stress testing allowed 45% of patients to avoid cardiac catheterization before renal transplantation. Discontinuing beta-blockers before thallium stress tests may improve exercise performance. The risk of perioperative cardiac events after transplantation was low and not different among patient groups. The relatively low predictive value of thallium stress testing for significant coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac events in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease suggests the need for the development of a more cost-effective, noninvasive screening test for this patient population. 
Diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis: value of color Doppler imaging. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of color Doppler imaging in the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis. Two hundred fifteen patients were studied with color Doppler imaging to determine patency of the main portal vein. Sonographic findings were confirmed in 75 patients, aged 19 to 66 years. Correlation with angiography was obtained in 13 patients, and surgical correlation was obtained in the remaining 62. Nine patients had portal vein thrombosis on the basis of these gold standards. Sonograms were classified as showing either patency or thrombosis, depending on the ability to show color flow within the main portal vein. Agreement between sonography and angiography or surgery was found in 69 patients (61 patent, eight thrombosed). One patient with a patent portal vein at sonography was found to have a thrombosed vessel at surgery, whereas five patients without portal venous flow at sonography had patent vessels at angiography (one patient) or surgery (four patients). Overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of portal vein thrombosis were 89% and 92%, with an accuracy of 92%, a false-negative rate of 0.11, a negative predictive value of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.62. We postulate that the majority of errors in our study occurred in vessels that, although patent, had only sluggish flow, which could not be resolved because of technical limitations. We conclude that color Doppler imaging is a valuable screening procedure for the assessment of portal vein patency. If the sonogram shows a patent portal vein, no further studies are required. However, a lack of demonstrable flow does not always indicate thrombosis, and other imaging studies should be performed for confirmation. 
Local control and survival from the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group studies of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and the Vienna Bone Tumor Registry. The use of aggressive chemotherapy undoubtedly has brought about a dramatic increase in the cure rate of osteosarcoma. The authors' investigations have increased the authors' knowledge of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, the differential efficacy of currently used agents, and the pronounced schedule dependency and relative route independency of their efficiency. The authors were able to confirm the prognostic significance of tumor response after preoperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy in itself has facilitated and promoted limb-salvage surgery. Also, more patients can be cured today by use of aggressive thoracic surgery in case of primary or secondary pulmonary metastases. The authors' efforts to steadily increase metastasis-free survival rates by intensifying chemotherapy in this series of studies, however, have been only moderately successful. Still, chemotherapy-related acute toxicity is considerable and increases with aggressiveness of treatment, and the manifestations of late toxicity may continue to increase with follow-up time. Future trials should be targeted toward exploration of the minimum indispensable amount of toxic treatment yielding comparable or even better results than those currently attainable. 
Rupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. During a 20 year period from 1970 to 1989, 1100 patients underwent mitral valve replacement. Rupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle occurred in seven patients (0.6%); four in the operating room and three in the postoperative room. It was possible to institute CP bypass in six patients and in all of them bleeding was controlled successfully, with repair by an external approach. Only one patient survived. We believe that institution of CP bypass and reinfusion of cardioplegic solution is a major determinant of the outcome. 
Heterogeneity of immunotypes of heat-labile enterotoxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli of human origin. A new technique, checkerboard immunoblotting (CBIB), has been applied to detect and to differentiate heat-labile enterotoxins, (LTs), from enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli of human origin using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Optimal conditions of production and release of LTs were defined using CBIB. LT release was enhanced when E. coli cells were treated with 8 M urea. LT production was highest when E. coli strains were incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 degrees C for 12 h in CAYE-2 medium. Two hundred and five strains of E. coli, isolated from patients with diarrhea in Japan, Thailand, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, were examined for LT. Of 133 LT-positive strains, 4 (3%) produced an LT that reacted like H-LT-1 (originally isolated from E. coli strain H-74-114) while 126 strains (94.7%) produced LT that reacted like H-LT-2 (originally isolated from strain H-10407) or H-LT-3 (from strain H-240-3). Three strains of human origin (2.3%) produced an LT that reacted like P-LT (produced by E. coli strains of porcine origin). This study shows that CBIB, a simple, efficient, and practical assay, might be useful for epidemiologic surveys and for evaluation of serologic responses to LTs and antitoxic vaccines. 
Role of von Willebrand factor in arterial thrombosis. Studies in normal and von Willebrand disease pigs. With normal and von Willebrand disease (vWD) pigs, we studied the role of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet-vessel wall interactions and occlusive arterial thrombosis. Two methods of arterial injury have been used to determine the thrombotic response of flowing blood in vivo. The first involves balloon catheter injury. After superficial denudation of endothelium from coronary intima, platelets adhere to the subendothelium in a monolayer. Similar numbers of adherent platelets are found in both phenotypes, but platelets in vWD pigs have impaired pseudopod formation and are less well spread morphological indexes of limited platelet activation. Deeper injury, which involves the media, produces nonocclusive platelet-fibrin microthrombi. The second injury method involves pinching the artery at a site of superimposed stenosis, a procedure that almost always exposes media. This procedure induces platelet-fibrin microthrombi in normal and vWD pigs, but only normal pigs develop occlusive thrombosis. Both methods of arterial injury have also been performed in normal and vWD pigs with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis promotes platelet spread in vWD pigs but does not abolish the protection from stenosis and injury-induced occlusive thrombosis. In addition, neutralization of vWF activity in normal pigs by a monoclonal antibody prevents the induction of occlusive thrombosis by the stenosis and pinch-injury procedure. This monoclonal antibody also causes performed platelet aggregates to break up. These experimental models of inducing arterial thrombosis have been used in normal and vWD pigs to demonstrate interactions between normal and atherosclerotic vessel wall constituents, circulating platelets and vWF that are fundamental in the process of arterial thrombosis. 
Serum zinc, copper, and selenium levels in inflammatory bowel disease: effect of total enteral nutrition on trace element status. Serum levels of zinc, copper, and selenium, and alkaline phosphatase activity were prospectively studied in 29 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Fifteen patients had extensive active colitis (active colitis group). Seven patients had active, and seven cases inactive small bowel or ileocecal Crohn's disease (small bowel disease group). Ninety-three healthy subjects acted as controls. Serum trace element levels were considered in relation to vitamin A and E levels, nutritional parameters, the activity of the disease, and the recent intake of steroids. The effect of total enteral nutrition on serum trace elements was studied in seven cases. Serum zinc levels were lower and serum copper levels higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.0007, and p = 0.02, respectively). More than 50% of patients with active colonic or small bowel disease showed zinc levels below the 15th percentile of the control group. Serum zinc levels correlated with plasma vitamin A in acute colitis (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), and with both serum albumin concentration (r = 0.76; p = 0.002) and disease activity score (r = -0.67, p = 0.009) in patients with small bowel disease. The copper:zinc ratio was higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.002). In spite of the increase in serum albumin levels and the decrease in disease activity, serum zinc levels remained low after total enteral nutrition. The implications of the abnormal trace element status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed. 
Tranexamic acid treatment of hemothorax in two patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients with malignant mesothelioma may present with hemothorax. We used a combination of oral and intrapleural tranexamic acid to treat two patients with this severe complication. Initiation of treatment with this potent anti-fibrinolytic drug resulted in rapid reduction of bleeding and of transfusion requirements. 
Peripheral nerve lesions in hemophilia. Between 1962 and 1986, eighty-one of the 1351 admissions of patients who had hemophilia to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre were for peripheral nerve lesions. Eighty-eight such lesions were identified in fifty-four patients, and thirty-nine of these patients (sixty-one lesions) had adequate follow-up (mean, 8.4 years; range, four months to eighteen years). The femoral nerve was most commonly involved, but involvement of other peripheral nerves also occurred. In thirty (49 per cent) of the sixty-one lesions, the nerve had full motor and sensory recovery; in twenty-one (34 per cent), a residual sensory deficit; and in ten (16 per cent), both a persistent motor and sensory deficit. Patients who had antibodies to factor VIII were significantly less likely to recover full motor or sensory function than were those who did not have such antibodies, and the time to full motor recovery in these patients was significantly longer. 
Mammography in the management of patients with small breast cancers. Findings on mammography resulted in a change of treatment policy in 17 of 200 patients with small breast cancers (T1/T2 less than 4 cm, N0/N1, M0). Twelve patients were considered unsuitable for conservation therapy because of mammographic evidence of either extensive in situ carcinoma or more than one focus of invasive carcinoma. These patients were treated by mastectomy and histology confirmed widespread in situ carcinoma or multifocal/multicentric invasive carcinoma. Seven patients were found to have unsuspected contralateral lesions on mammography, of which five were subsequently shown to be malignant. Routine preoperative mammography is essential in the management of patients with small breast cancers. 
Treating insulin resistance in hypertension with metformin reduces both blood pressure and metabolic risk factors. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia may play an important role in both the development of hypertension and its accompanying metabolic aberrations. In order to investigate this possibility, nine non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smoking, middle-aged men with untreated hypertension were treated with metformin 850 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks as a pilot study and within-patient comparison. Metformin decreased total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01), triglyceride (P less than 0.01), fasting plasma insulin (P less than 0.01) and C-peptide levels (P less than 0.02). Glucose disposal, an indicator of insulin action measured by means of the euglycaemic clamp technique, increased (P less than 0.001). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased (P less than 0.02), and t-PA antigen decreased (P less than 0.01), whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and fibrinogen were unaffected by metformin treatment. Body weight remained unchanged. Withdrawal of metformin was associated with the return of both blood pressure and metabolism towards the initial levels. In conclusion, metformin treatment increased insulin action, lowered blood pressure, improved the metabolic risk factor profile and tended to increase the fibrinolytic activity in these mildly hypertensive subjects. These results support the view that insulin resistance plays a role in hypertension, and may open up a new field for the alleviation of abnormalities associated with cardiovascular disease. 
Generalized cortical dysplasia. Clinical and pathologic aspects. Three children with profound mental retardation and intractable seizures died at ages 10 months, 3 years, and 7 years, respectively. Complete examination of their brains showed generalized cortical dysplasia, without any major malformation of the external gyral pattern. The neuropathologic features of cortical dysplasia include abnormally thickened cortex with indistinct demarcation of the gray-white matter junction. In many areas, the cortex contained increased numbers of large neurons with disordered cortical lamination. Heterotopic neurons were scattered throughout the white matter with decreased myelination of the underlying white matter. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first fully detailed neuropathologic study of diffuse cortical dysplasia--a newly recognized entity of abnormal neuronal migration. 
Alcohol induction of ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HEP G2). Hyperferritinemia, an unclear mechanism, is frequently observed in chronic alcoholics. The aim of this work was to study the effect of alcohol on ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. This cell line proved to be sensitive to alcohol, since alcohol increased gamma-GT activity both in cells and media. The most striking result was the increase of ferritin in cells and media by alcohol. Moreover, this effect was specific, since it contrasted with a decrease in total protein synthesis and secretion, a decrease in transferrin excretion and a lack of effect on orosomucoid. In our model, alcohol was able to induce, in a specific manner, ferritin expression. 
Comparison of the findings on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography: implications regarding the identification of myocardium at ischemic risk. The evidence of myocardium at potential ischemic risk on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy was compared with that of manifest ischemia on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in 26 patients at high risk of a coronary event undergoing noncardiac surgery. The clinical outcome was also assessed. Induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were more common in patients and myocardial segments with, than in those without, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect (both p less than 0.05). Conversely, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect was more common in patients and segments with, than in those without, a new intraoperative wall motion abnormality (both p less than 0.05). Six patients, five with a reversible scintigraphic defect but only three with a new wall motion abnormality, had a hard perioperative ischemic event. Events occurred more often among patients with, than in those without, a reversible perioperative scintigraphic defect (5 [33%] of 15 vs. 1 [9%] of 11) but this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.14), probably owing to the sample size. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were all reversible and did not differentiate between risk groups; these findings were possibly influenced by treatment. These preliminary data support the known relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and perioperative events and identify another manifestation of ischemic risk in the relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities. The value of intraoperative echocardiography in identifying ischemia and guiding therapy in patients with a reversible scintigraphic abnormality should be further assessed. 
Recognition, management, and prevention of Clostridium septicum abscess in immunosuppressed patients. Spontaneous gas gangrene due to Clostridium septicum is a rapidly progressing disease that usually ends in fatal toxemia. We report three cases of asymptomatic C septicum abscesses to document the clinical course of this entity and to establish guidelines for its prevention and treatment. In contrast to previously reported data, C septicum infections can produce abscesses in solid organs, the retroperitoneum, and the extremities. These lesions often occur in patients with cancer, producing liver abscesses without gas formation that may be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma. Symptoms may be minimal or nonspecific before fulminant toxemia. Asymptomatic bacteremia should prompt a search for unsuspected cancer and an abscess. Computed tomography is the diagnostic modality of choice. The treatment consists of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue in concert with an appropriate course of antibiotics. We have found recurrences after adequate debridement and short-term antibiotic therapy, suggesting that prolonged and even lifelong prophylactic oral penicillin G potassium may be necessary to prevent further recurrences. 
Time course of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after endotoxin infusion in unanesthetized sheep. Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] has been reported to reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus increases venous admixture. The time course of this failure of pulmonary blood flow regulation was investigated in six chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep after infusion of Escherichia coli LPS (1 microgram/kg). The change in left pulmonary arterial blood flow (LPBF, ultrasonic transit time) in response to unilateral lung hypoxia (10 min of N2 alternately to the left and right lungs) was compared before and at various time intervals after the administration of LPS. During baseline conditions, LPBF was 33% of total cardiac output and decreased to 15% when the left lung was ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture. One hour after endotoxin infusion, LPBF remained at 33% of total cardiac output yet only decreased to 28% during the hypoxic challenge. The response to one-lung hypoxia was still significantly depressed 10 h post-LPS administration. It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is almost completely abolished for a prolonged time period after a small dose of LPS. 
Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. 
Changes in upper airway resistance during progressive normocapnic hypoxia in normal men. The effects of normocapnic progressive hypoxia on nasal and pharyngeal resistances were evaluated in nine normal men. To calculate resistances, upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx, and we measured flow with a Fleish no. 3 pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting mask. Both resistances were obtained during a baseline period and during progressive normocapnic hypoxia achieved by a rebreathing method. We collected the breath-by-breath values of upper airway resistances, minute ventilation, O2 and CO2 fractions, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), and changes in functional residual capacity (inductance vest). The central respiratory drive was evaluated by the mouth occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1), and breath-by-breath P0.1 values were estimated by intrapolation from the linear relationship between P0.1 and SaO2. In each subject both resistances decreased during the hypoxic test. The slope of the decrease in resistance with decreasing SaO2 (%baseline/%SaO2) was steeper for pharyngeal resistance than for nasal resistance [2.67 +/- 0.29 and 1.61 +/- 0.25 (SE), respectively; P less than 0.05]. The slope of the decrease in resistance with increasing P0.1 (%baseline/cmH2O) was -0.24 +/- 0.05 for nasal resistance and -0.39 +/- 0.07 for pharyngeal resistance (P less than 0.05). Functional residual capacity progressively increased during the test, but the decrease in resistance was greater than expected from an isolated increase in lung volume. We conclude that nasal and pharyngeal resistances decrease during progressive normocapnic hypoxia. 
Long-term angiographic follow-up after angioplasty of venous coronary bypass grafts. From April 1981 to June 1987, 57 patients underwent venous coronary bypass graft percutaneous angioplasty and had a minimal follow-up of 18 months. The procedure was elective for 28 patients, urgent for 19, and was considered as an emergency for 10. A total of 64 grafts were dilated that had been bypassed 58 +/- 48 months previously (range 2 to 184 months); lesions were located on the aortic anastomosis in 12 grafts, on the body in 38, and on the coronary anastomosis in 14. Technical success was 95.3% (61 of 64) per lesion; clinical success was 84.4% (54 of 64) per lesion and 82.5% (47 of 57) per patient. Thrombotic complications with images of a lacunar defect occurred in 11 grafts (17.2%). Predictive factors for these complications were: age of grafts 38.5% for greater than 60 month grafts versus 2.6% for less than 60 month grafts (p less than 0.01); site of lesion, body lesion 28.9% versus anastomosis none (p less than 0.01); type of lesion, concentric and short 6% versus other 29% (p less than 0.05); and recent fibrinolysis in 66% versus 10.6% (p less than 0.05). Long-term follow-up is available in the 47 successful patients and the three limited non-Q wave myocardial infarction patients. Two patients died at 13 and 17 months. Long-term angiographic follow-up is available in 45 of 48 patients or 94%. At the end of the study, 35 of 57 (61.4%) venous bypass grafts in 32 patients (64%) were patent after one or more percutaneous transluminal angioplasties. 
Differences in "primary response" gene expression in renal compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The induction of a family of primary response genes (ie, genes whose transcription is not dependent on new protein synthesis) occurs within minutes after stimulation of quiescent 3T3 cells by phorbol esters and growth factors. A similar pattern of gene expression is seen in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells induced to differentiate by nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that a common set of activating signals occur in different forms of cell growth. To determine whether the same "activation" process occurs in renal hypertrophy, we measured mRNA levels in mice subjected to uninephrectomy (UNX) or sham operation. Regenerative renal hyperplasia was induced by intraperitoneal folic acid (FA) injection with vehicle as control. Northern blots showed induction of these genes by FA with elevated mRNA levels persisting for up to 24 to 48 hours. UNX and sham operation demonstrated a slight and transient elevation of mRNA levels, with a prompt return to basal levels by 60 minutes. 
Long-term psychologic implications of congenital heart disease: a 25-year follow-up. Patients with various types of congenital heart disease were contacted 25 years after their original examination at the Mayo Clinic. In addition to providing their current health status, level of education achieved, and current occupation, they were asked to complete a detailed standardized questionnaire to assess their degree of psychologic stress. Of the original 463 patients, 168 completed and returned the psychologic questionnaires. These patients had evidence of psychologic stress in excess of that expected on the basis of normative data. Furthermore, the degree of stress was unrelated to the clinical severity of the original cardiac defect. In addition, the psychologic stress occurred despite "success" as defined by educational achievement and occupational level. One can speculate that as children these patients were exposed to environmental stresses that may well have been colored by parental attitudes and perceptions. 
Spinal epidural hematoma causing cord compression after tissue plasminogen activator and heparin therapy. Bleeding is the most serious complication of thrombolytic therapy and limits its usefulness. We have reported a case of epidural hematoma, a rare occurrence after combined therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and heparin. We emphasize that in patients treated with thrombolytic agents, any trauma may increase the risk of bleeding. The sudden onset of back pain and neurologic deficits should alert the clinician to the possibility of spinal hematoma with cord compression. 
Cerebral edema causing death in children with maple syrup urine disease. Four children with the classic form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) died of cerebral edema during an intercurrent infection that caused severe dehydration and acidosis. The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed. 
The association of frequent headaches with personality and life events. The associations between personality traits, life events and frequent headaches were studied in a sample of 5766 adult subjects between 20 and 65 years of age from the general population. Subjects with at least weekly headaches had more life events and higher inadequacy, social inadequacy, rigidity and injuredness than subjects with less frequent headaches. These relationships were not observed in subjects of 50 years of age and older, with the exception of the association with inadequacy. From the traits measured, inadequacy had the highest odds ratios for frequent headaches and showed a modest interaction with the presence of a life event. These findings are in agreement with Sarason's interactional model. 
Inflammation at the neuromuscular junction in myasthenia gravis. To better define the pathogenic mechanisms in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the morphology and electrophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in anconeus muscle biopsy specimens from eight patients with MG and seven control subjects. There were inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junction in seven of the eight biopsies from MG patients. The endplate index (length of the postsynaptic membrane divided by the length of the apposed presynaptic membrane) was abnormally reduced in all the MG patients, and fiber type grouping, suggestive of reinnervation, was present in six of the eight MG patients. Intracellular recording revealed diminished amplitude of miniature endplate potentials and miniature endplate currents in the MG patients compared with the controls. The time constant of decay of miniature endplate currents did not differ from that of controls, suggesting no change in mean channel open time of the acetylcholine receptor. The endplate receptor sensitivity to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine was also decreased in MG patients compared with controls. The quantal content of neurally evoked endplate potentials was reduced in six of the eight MG patients, demonstrating abnormal presynaptic function as well. The presence of inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junctions of limb muscles in MG reconciles an apparent disparity between the animal model of MG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and the human disease. This study also demonstrates a frequent presynaptic component to the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in MG. 
On lowering lipids in the post-infarction patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) elevated serum cholesterol levels, like other classical risk factors, remain predictive of further coronary events. The excess risk attributable to raised cholesterol levels is considerable, and greater than that in subjects without CHD. A recent meta-analysis of all eight qualifying trials of secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering is reviewed. There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present. 
Glutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures. 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency. 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations. The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations. The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution. 
Polysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule distinguishes small cell lung carcinoma from carcinoids. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in various types of neuroendocrine cells and their tumors. A typical feature of NCAM is polysialic acid, of which the chain length is developmentally regulated. The authors have performed a comparative immunohistochemical study on small cell lung carcinomas and bronchial as well as gastrointestinal carcinoids with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 735 reactive with the long-chain form of polysialic acid. The small cell lung carcinomas, irrespective of their histological type, were positive for polysialic acid. Metastatic tumor cell complexes also exhibited immunostaining. The tumor cell-surface-associated immunostaining for polysialic acid was sensitive to endoneuraminidase. The mature and atypical bronchial and gastrointestinal carcinoids were not immunoreactive for polysialic acid. Cytoplasmic staining in groups of cells of carcinoids (2 of 28 cases) was due to nonspecific antibody binding, which could be prevented by increased ion strength. These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be distinguished by their content of highly sialylated NCAM. 
Malignant tumors of the eye in geriatric patients. The ocular tissues can be the site of a number of malignant tumors in adults and geriatric patients. In addition to posing a threat to the patient's life, these tumors can cause severe visual loss or blindness. Therefore, the primary care clinician should be capable of prompt diagnosis of the various malignant ocular tumors and be prepared to refer the patient for appropriate management. This article provides a photographic guide to the most common primary and secondary malignancies that can affect the eyelid, conjunctiva, intraocular structures, and orbit in the geriatric patient. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: a multivariate statistical model to relate lesion and procedure variables to restenosis. The M-HEART Investigators. The Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial group obtained follow-up angiography in 510 patients with 598 successfully dilated coronary lesions who were enrolled in a controlled trial of the effects of a single dose of 1 g of methylprednisolone on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and "optimal" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis. 
Prenatal diagnosis of fetal left ventricular aneurysm: a case report and review. Fetal echocardiography in a 30-year-old black woman, gravida 4, para 3, demonstrated left ventricular aneurysm. This was confirmed by color flow pulsed Doppler techniques. After delivery, neonatal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed the diagnosis. The infant was followed closely and underwent surgical correction at 8.5 months of age. Before surgery, cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal hemodynamic function. A review of the literature revealed a paucity of information. Issues of prenatal diagnosis, antenatal surveillance, method of delivery, and neonatal follow-up are not well defined in either the obstetric or pediatric cardiology literature. A rationale for our approach to this complex problem is presented. 
Community obstetric care in West Berkshire OBJECTIVE--To assess the effects of a revised obstetric booking policy whereby all low risk pregnant women received their antenatal care entirely in the community. DESIGN--Comparison of the distribution of antenatal clinic attendances, transfers, and perinatal mortality rates for 1987 and 1989, before and after introduction of the revised policy. SETTING--West Berkshire Health District. SUBJECTS--All women who delivered with a registrable birth in the district in 1987 (5817 women) and 1989 (5372). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Attendances at community and consultant antenatal clinics; bookings transferred from community care to consultant care; perinatal mortality rates. RESULTS--Of 5372 women delivering in West Berkshire in 1989, 3185 (58.3%) were originally booked for general practitioner-midwife care, of whom 1567 (49.2% of general practitioner-midwife bookings) were transferred to consultant care. 1618 women (30.1% of all women delivered) received their entire obstetric care from general practitioners and midwives. Attendance at hospital antenatal clinics was reduced by 16%. In 1989 the perinatal mortality rates (1987 values) for the district were 6.3 (7.6) per 1000 births overall; 8.2 (8.3) per 1000 consultant bookings; 5.0 (4.7) per 1000 for community bookings; and 10.2 (14.4) per 1000 for women transferred to consultant care. CONCLUSION--Antenatal care of low risk pregnant women may safely be provided by their general practitioner and midwife. 
Outcome of psychogenic seizures in children and adolescents compared with adults. We compared outcome of psychogenic seizures documented by video-EEG in 18 nonepileptic children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18; median, 14.5 years old) and 20 adults (ages 25 to 56; median, 34.0 years old). Outcome was significantly better for the younger patients at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after diagnosis. At these follow-up times, the percentages of children and adolescents free of psychogenic attacks were 73%, 75%, and 81%; at the same follow-up times, the percentages of adults free of psychogenic attacks were only 25%, 25%, and 40%. Factors leading to better outcome for younger patients may have been different psychological mechanisms at different ages of onset and greater effectiveness with earlier intervention. 
Criteria for the diagnosis of migraine in clinical practice. Criteria for the diagnosis of migraine have evolved from generalized descriptions to specific rules designed to ensure the selection of homogenous groups of patients for research studies. For clinical practice, the former are insufficiently specific and the latter are too complex. For care of headache patients by primary care physicians, we propose that the diagnosis of migraine without aura (common migraine) is warranted if any two of the following symptoms are present: unilateral site, throbbing quality, nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. These criteria are derived from a study comparing the features of 100 patients with migraine without aura and 100 patients with chronic daily headache. The proposed criteria for the diagnosis of migraine without aura were highly sensitive and adequately specific in discriminating groups. These simple criteria should facilitate the diagnosis of migraine by primary care physicians. 
Use of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. 
Impairment of mitochondrial transcription termination by a point mutation associated with the MELAS subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with several different human diseases, including the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mutations include deletions but also duplications and point mutations. Individuals with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) carry a common A-to-G substitution in a highly conserved portion of the gene for transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)). Although the MELAS mutation may be comparable to the defect in the tRNA(Lys) gene associated with MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres), it is also embedded in the middle of a tridecamer sequence necessary for the formation of the 3' ends of 16S ribosomal RNA in vitro. We found that the MELAS mutation results in severe impairment of 16S rRNA transcription termination, which correlates with a reduced affinity of the partially purified termination protein for the MELAS template. This suggests that the molecular defect in MELAS is the inability to produce the correct type and quantity of rRNA relative to other mitochondrial gene products. 
Differential effects of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, on occlusive thrombosis elicited by endothelial cell injury or by deep vascular damage in canine coronary arteries. In open-chest dogs, cyclic flow reductions (CFRs, 5.1-6.6/hr in controls; n = 24) caused by platelet deposition/dislodgment at sites of endothelial cell injury in critically stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries (59% flow reduction) were attenuated to the same extent either by single thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibition (0.31 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.16 +/- 0.16/hr; n = 6; p less than 0.05) or by a comparatively modest degree of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism on top of TXA2 synthase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.22 +/- 0.1/hr; n = 10; p less than 0.05). By contrast, occlusive thrombosis on deep vascular damage elicited by intraluminal stimulation (150-microA anodal constant current) in nonpreconstricted canine coronary arteries (time to occlusion, 237.1 +/- 13.9 minutes; n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, six of seven experiments) was not affected by platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid; n = 7), single TXA2 synthase inhibition (1.25 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; n = 7), or single TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. sulotroban for 300 minutes; n = 5). However, such an occlusive thrombus formation was significantly reduced by combined TXA2 synthase/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; time to occlusion greater than 300 minutes, n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, one of seven experiments; p less than 0.05). This study reveals 1) a differential efficacy of TXA2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, depending on the extent of the vessel wall lesion triggering thrombosis and the size of the thrombus required to obstruct the vascular lumen and 2) a significant synergism in preventing occlusive thrombosis of extensively damaged coronary arteries between strong TXA2 synthase inhibition and comparatively modest TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism with ridogrel. 
Double blind crossover comparison of the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive (VVIR) pacing on neuroendocrine variables, exercise performance, and symptoms in complete heart block. OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive pacing (activity sensing) (VVIR) in patients with complete heart block. DESIGN--Double blind crossover comparison with one month in each pacing mode. PATIENTS--10 consecutive patients aged 23-74 presenting with complete anterograde atrioventricular block at rest and on exercise and with an intact atrial rate response received Synergyst I (Medtronic) pacemakers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Symptom scores, maximal exercise performance on a treadmill, and the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. RESULTS--No significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. One patient with intact ventriculoatrial conduction developed pacemaker syndrome during VVIR pacing. Resting plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were raised in complete heart block and were restored to normal by DDD pacing but not by VVIR pacing. Resting plasma catecholamine concentrations were normal in complete heart block and in both pacing modes. During exercise the increase in the concentrations of all three hormones was similar in both pacing modes. CONCLUSIONS--In patients with complete anterograde and retrograde atrioventricular block, symptoms and maximal exercise performance were no better during DDD than during VVIR pacing. 
Epstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection. 
Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid treated by the Matti-Russe operation. A long-term review of 77 cases. We report the long-term results of the Matti-Russe operation for pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid in 100 cases, reported previously by Mulder in 1968. Clinical results for 77 patients and radiographic data for 74 were reviewed at 22 to 34.8 years after surgery. In general, there was satisfactory relief of pain and stiffness but some patients had limitation of motion and reduced grip-strength, with usually slight osteoarthritic changes. There was poor correlation between subjective, objective, and radiographic results but 88% of the patients were satisfied with their results. 
Hydroureteronephrosis secondary to perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Complications related to Meckel's diverticulum are not unusual. However, involvement of the urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of ureteral obstruction due to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum. 
Pathogenesis of respiratory infections due to influenza virus: implications for developing countries. The influenza viruses have an important and distinctive place among respiratory viruses: they change antigenic character at irregular intervals, infect individuals of all ages, cause illnesses characterized by constitutional symptoms and tracheobronchitis, produce yearly epidemics associated frequently with excess morbidity and mortality, and predispose the host to bacterial superinfections. Much is known about influenza viruses, but their role in respiratory infections among children in developing countries is poorly understood, and the risk factors that lead to the excess morbidity and mortality have not been identified clearly. Among the many risk factors that may be important are alterations in host immunity, malnutrition, prior or coincident infections with other microorganisms, inhaled pollutants, and lack of access to medical care. There is a great need for research that can establish more precisely the role these and other unidentified factors play in the pathogenesis of influenza infections in children in the developing world. 
Expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the human ventricle is independent of chamber dilation This study investigated the presence of atrial natriuretic factor in ventricular tissue obtained from humans with dilated or restrictive heart disease. In 17 patients with ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function and in 8 patients with restrictive heart disease and preserved systolic function, the presence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in tissue obtained by ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The objective of the study was to determine if the ventricular presence of atrial natriuretic factor is dependent on ventricular dilation. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was greater in the group with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the group with restrictive cardiomyopathy (134 +/- 13 versus 78 +/- 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.05); end-diastolic pressure was elevated in the two groups (20 +/- 2 versus 25 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS). With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was clearly detected in 15 of the 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 of the 8 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor in living patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Whereas in the atria, stretch or dilation may be an important stimulus, atrial natriuretic factor in the ventricular chamber occurs independent of dilation. 
Knowledge-based computer system to aid in the histopathological diagnosis of breast disease. A knowledge-based computer system, designed to assist pathologists in the histological diagnosis of breast disease, is described. This system represents knowledge in the form of "disease profiles" and uses a novel inference model based on the mathematical technique of hypergraphs. Its design overcomes many of the limitations of existing expert system technologies when applied to breast disease. In particular, the system can quickly focus on a differential problem and thus reduce the amount of data necessary to reach a conclusion. The system was tested on two sets of samples, consisting of 14 retrospective cases and five hypothetical cases of breast disease. Its recommendations were judged "correct" by the evaluating pathologist in 15 cases. This study shows the feasibility of providing "decision support" in histopathology. 
Diurnal variations of neurocardiac rhythms in acute myocardial infarction. To determine the diurnal pattern of cardiac autonomic tone in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this study examined the power spectrum of heart rate (HR) variability in 24 patients during a single 24-hour segment within 4 days of AMI. Patients were nonrandomly allocated to a group (n = 14) without autonomic drugs and to a group (n = 10) already receiving beta blockers at the time of AMI. With use of autoregressive modeling, the power spectrum of HR variability was computed from continuous 1-hour electrocardiographic segments recorded at equally spaced intervals; 7 to 8 A.M., 3 to 4 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. All patients were supine, awake and pain free during recordings. There were no differences in HR, HR variance or the low-frequency peak power (0.06 to 0.1 Hz) from one temporal sequence to another. For the patients not taking beta blockers, the high-frequency peak power (0.2 to 0.36 Hz) or vagal component increased significantly from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. (28 +/- 11 to 45 +/- 20 beats/min2.Hz-1, p less than 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the low- to high-frequency peak power and area ratios from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. All power spectral parameters in the patients taking beta blockers remained unchanged over 24 hours. There was significantly heightened vagal modulation of sinus node activity in those receiving beta blockers, especially at 7 A.M. and 3 P.M. The data suggest that under steady-state wakeful conditions in the early recovery phase after an AMI, vagal tone is more pronounced during the late evening hours with a possible shift to relative sympathetic dominance during early morning and midafternoon hours. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Explicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings. Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls. Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes. Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia. 
Lupron retards proliferation of ovarian epithelial tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium. Some patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer respond favorably to treatment with GnRH agonists. This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment. 
Early-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice. An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure. This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice. 
Minute lesions of the rectum and sigmoid colon in patients with Crohn's disease. Sigmoidoscopy with a spray of 0.1% indigocarmine was performed on 20 patients with Crohn's disease whose main lesions were located proximal to the transverse colon and on 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. Minute lesions such as apthoid lesions, areas of erythema, and small ulcers were found in 90% of patients with Crohn's disease and in 0% of healthy volunteers (p less than 0.001). Among the minute lesions, aphthoid lesions were found in the highest incidence (85%). It was difficult to determine the presence of aphthoid lesions without the spray of indigocarmine, which facilitated detection. Histologically, granulomas were found in 15% of patients with Crohn's disease. Aphthoid lesions were not associated with superficial erosions and lymphoid follicles. The presence of aphthoid lesions in the rectum and sigmoid colon would be a strong indication of the presence of Crohn's disease. 
Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 2. Long-term effects. Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats 5 months after creating a large aortocaval fistula. At that time, cardiac output, left and right ventricular pressures, and left and right ventricular dP/dtmax were measured. Subsequently, isolated cardiac myocytes were collected from the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum for cell size measurements. Compared with sham-operated controls, percent dry weight was reduced in the liver and kidney but was unchanged in the lung. Heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, and systolic aortic pressure were not changed in rats with fistulas. However, cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and all measured parameters in the right ventricle were significantly increased. Mean cell volume and the ratio of heart weight to body weight were both elevated 92%. Cell volume, cell length, and cross-sectional area increased significantly in each heart region examined. Hypertrophy was more pronounced in cells from the right ventricle and the endomyocardium of the left ventricle. The percentage of cells with mononucleation or binucleation was not changed in any heart region of rats with fistulas. In summary, despite evidence of renal and hepatic congestion, most indexes of cardiac function were normal or elevated 5 months after creation of a large volume-overload-induced hypertrophy. Data from isolated cardiac myocytes suggested that cellular hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, was responsible for the increased cardiac mass. 
Somatosensory function following dorsal root entry zone lesions in patients with neurogenic pain or spasticity. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a "retuning" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented. 
Control of local blood flow in pulmonary inflammation: role for neutrophils, PAF, and thromboxane. The intrapulmonary instillation of C5a results in a local inflammatory response that, in this site, is accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. Reversal of this decrease by vasodilators or the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegral has been shown to result in enhanced lung inflammation. In the present study the mechanisms underlying the decrease in flow in pulmonary inflammation were investigated in the rabbit in vivo and in the isolated blood-perfused rabbit lung. In vivo, the decrease in local blood flow was shown to be dependent on circulating neutrophils. In the isolated blood-perfused lung, inflammation induced by airway instillation of C5a was similar histologically to that seen in vivo and was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. The decrease in blood flow appeared to require circulating neutrophils and was prevented by dazmegral and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB 2086 and L-659,989. Furthermore, no decrease occurred in aspirin-treated lungs perfused with normal blood, suggesting that the source of thromboxane was lung rather than circulating cells. The decrease in blood flow in inflammation did not appear to be a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Inflammation in the guinea pig lung was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow and was also prevented by dazmegral and PAF antagonists. We conclude that local inflammation in the lung is accompanied by a decrease in blood flow that involves neutrophils and the lipid mediators PAF and thromboxane. We suggest that this form of negative feedback by the neutrophil serves to control the inflammatory response. 
Role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and evaluation of severity of mitral and tricuspid stenosis. The presence, severity, and hemodynamic consequences of mitral and tricuspid stenosis can be determined by echocardiographic techniques. In mitral stenosis two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging allows definition of leaflet anatomy and dynamics, subvalvular disease, ventricular function, and involvement of other valves. Spectral and color Doppler echocardiographic techniques permit accurate measurement of transvalvular gradient, determination of functional orifice area, evaluation of associated valvular regurgitation, and assessment of pulmonary artery pressures. These approaches are of recognized clinical value, and they provide additional diagnostic information that is unavailable from clinical assessment alone in a significant number of patients. Compared with available invasive diagnostic standards of reference, echocardiographic data have been found to be comparable in accuracy. In tricuspid stenosis echocardiographic imaging and Doppler techniques provide an assessment of valve morphology and function that should be similarly useful in clinical management decisions, although rigorous comparative studies have not been performed. Currently, carefully done echocardiographic studies are a definitive means of establishing the presence and significance of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, thereby obviating the need for invasive evaluation in many patients, reducing risk, and potentially decreasing the cost of diagnostic assessment. 
Lack of diameter effect on short-term patency of size-matched Dacron aortobifemoral grafts. This study examined the relationship between graft diameter and subsequent patency in 79 patients who received Dacron aortobifemoral bypass grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease between 1985 and 1989. Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed "significant" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency. 
Amnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. 
DNA ploidy analysis of effectiveness of radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma. Cellular DNA content from 30 patients with cervical carcinoma was determined using flow cytometry before and after radiation therapy (RT). The authors attempted to correlate changes in DNA content, tumor response to RT, and post-RT pathologic findings. Before RT, tumors from eight of 30 patients (26.7%) were diploid or near-diploid; tumors from 22 patients (73.3%) were aneuploid. After RT, diploid or near-diploid tumors were found in 23 patients (76.7%), and aneuploid tumors were observed in seven patients (23.3%). Aneuploidy disappeared in 15 of the patient tumors, and complete tumor response (CR) was observed in 13 of these 15 patients (86.7%). Pathologic examinations were negative in 12 of 15 cases and suspicious in one of 15 cases. Of the seven patients whose tumor aneuploidy did not change after RT, CR was observed in only two (28.7%). Pathologic examinations were positive in five of seven cases and suspicious in one of seven cases. The CR for the 22 patients with pre-RT aneuploid tumors was 15 of 22 (68.2%); the CR for the eight patients with pre-RT diploid tumors was two of eight (25%, P less than 0.01). From these data the authors conclude there is a direct correlation between DNA content and radiosensitivity in cervical carcinoma. Aneuploid tumors from these patients were more radiosensitive than diploid tumors, and they patients had a better clinical tumor response and improved pathologic findings. 
Enhanced GABAergic inhibition preserves hippocampal structure and function in a model of epilepsy. Extensive electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway input to the hippocampus results in a characteristic pattern of neuronal death, which is accompanied by an impairment of cognitive functions similar to that seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. The excitotoxic hypothesis of epileptic cell death [Olney, J. W. (1978) in Kainic Acid as a Tool in Neurobiology, eds. McGeer, E., Olney, J. W. & McGeer, P. (Raven, New York), pp. 95-121; Olney, J. W. (1983) in Excitotoxins, eds. Fuxe, K., Roberts, P. J. & Schwartch, R. (Wenner-Gren International Symposium Series, Macmillan, London), Vol. 39, pp. 82-96; and Rothman, S. M. & Olney, J. W. (1986) Ann. Neurol. 19, 105-111] predicts an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which occurs probably as a result of hyperactivity in afferent pathways or impaired inhibition. In the present study, we investigated whether the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated (GABAergic) inhibition of neurotransmission by blocking the GABA-metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase, could influence the histopathological and/or the behavioral outcome in this epilepsy model. We demonstrate that the loss of pyramidal cells and hilar somatostatin-containing neurons can be abolished by enhancing the level of synaptically released GABA, and that the preservation of hippocampal structure is accompanied by a significant sparing of spatial memory as compared with placebo-treated controls. These results suggest that enhanced GABAergic inhibition can effectively block the pathophysiological processes that lead to excitotoxic cell death and, as a result, protect the brain from seizure-induced cognitive impairment. 
Cortical blindness in children: a study of etiology and prognosis. Thirty-four children (20 boys, 14 girls) with congenital and acquired cortical blindness were analyzed for visual outcome in relation to etiology, visual evoked potentials, electroencephalography, and cranial computed tomography. All 7 children with congenital cortical blindness remained blind on subsequent examination. Of the 27 children with acquired blindness, 16 (59%) had poor visual outcome. Poor visual outcome occurred in those with cardiac arrest, hypoxia, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, and head trauma. Good visual outcome occurred in children with hypotensive episodes after cardiac surgery. Of the 12 children with recovery of vision, the interval from acute loss of vision to partial or total recovery was 2 weeks to 5 months. Seven children had complete recovery of vision with no residual visual field defect. The majority of children (87%) had focal or multifocal spike-and-waves and slow sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography. None had photic recruitment response or occipital spike-and-wave discharges. Flash visual evoked potential studies performed during acute episodes of cortical blindness documented 11 with absent response, 10 with bilateral increases in latency, and 6 with normal responses. There was no correlation between normal visual evoked potentials and a good visual outcome. Only 2 of 6 children with normal responses had normal vision. Abnormal or absent responses are more predictive of a poor recovery of vision because only 3 of 21 (14%) had normal vision on subsequent examination. Abnormal electroencephalographic findings with focal or multifocal spike-and-wave discharges or cerebral atrophy on cranial computed tomography are also poor prognostic signs. 
Factors affecting ability to resume oral nutrition in the oropharyngeal dysphagic individual. Successful oral intake of nutrition depends not only on the patient's ability to swallow efficiently and safely but also a number of cognitive, neurolinguistic, and behavioral variables. This paper reviews these competencies as they are integrated into the act of oral feeding and describes the types of disorders that affect these abilities. Methods of evaluating and treating the abilities needed for successful oral intake are described. 
Recurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson disease. We describe the first patient with Wilson disease and recurrent abortion who was effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions. Between the ages of 21-26, this patient experienced seven successive unexplained abortions. At age 27, neurologic signs and liver function disturbances appeared. Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os. By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished. The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful. The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders. A strategy to this end is proposed. 
Ki-67 immunostaining in node-negative stage I/II breast carcinoma. Significant correlation with prognosis. Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity. 
A forensic application of DNA typing. Paternity determination in a putrefied fetus. Using minisatellite DNA probes that hybridize to a variable number of tandemly repeated loci, an individual-specific DNA fingerprint can be determined. In the case reported here, we succeeded in extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from a 3-month-old fetus discovered during the autopsy of a murdered 28-year-old pregnant woman reported missing 10 days earlier. The results of analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms showed that all bands present in the fetus's pattern, but absent in the mother's, matched only those of the putative father. Thus, the paternity of the victim's husband was ruled out. 
Chemotherapy dose intensity correlates strongly with response, median survival, and median progression-free survival in metastatic neuroblastoma We examined the efficacy of five commonly used drugs, teniposide (VM26), cisplatin (CDDP), cyclophosphamide (CPM), doxorubicin (DOXO), and vincristine (VCR) in a retrospective analysis of 44 clinical trials of induction chemotherapy for stage IV neuroblastoma patients newly diagnosed at older than 1 year of age. Dose intensity (DI) of each drug was calculated as milligrams per square meter per week. Linear regression analyses showed that the Dls of VM26 and CDDP had the greatest influence on clinical outcomes (ie, proportion of major response, median survival, and median progression-free survival [PFS]), while those of CPM and DOXO were less significant. VCR had no influence on the three clinical end points. Although many protocols extended treatment to more than 1 year, none of these end points correlated positively with the duration of therapy. Twenty-one weeks appeared adequate for achieving superior response, median survival, and median PFS. These results suggest that maximal dose intensification of selective drugs over a short duration may improve the outcome of patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma. 
Major amputations done with palliative intent in the treatment of local bony complications associated with advanced cancer. Palliative amputations were performed on 11 patients (7 men, 4 women) with disseminated disease to control local bony complications. The average patient age was 54 years (range 14-78 years). The primary diseases were melanoma/sarcoma (seven patients) and carcinoma (four patients). All had pain; eight had intractable pain that could not be controlled by analgesics. All 11 patients had additional severe local complications, which included recurrent pathological fracture (4), sepsis (2), hemorrhage (2), radiation necrosis (2), and iliofemoral thrombosis secondary to tumor (1). Previous attempts of palliation had been made in all 11 patients, and 8 had undergone previous operative procedures (5 had undergone two or more) prior to amputation. Three anterior hemipelvectomies, five posterior hemipelvectomies, two hip disarticulations, and one forequarter amputation were performed. All patients survived the surgery, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients received dramatic relief of pain. Postoperative complications included two cases of flap necrosis and two infections; all resolved satisfactorily. The six patients who were nonambulatory before surgery ambulated postoperatively, and two eventually ambulated with a prosthesis. Six of 11 patients survived 1 year or longer, with a median postoperative survival period of 13 months (average 16 months). Although major amputations are viewed at times as offering little to already-compromised patients, they can improve dramatically the quality of life in selected patients. 
Confirming the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire in acute clinical pain. Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, one previous confirmatory factor analytic study of chronic pain did statistically support the a priori model. Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain. 
The physician's responsibilities: residua and sequelae. Cardiologists assuming responsibility for adults with congenital heart disease must have knowledge of electrophysiologic, valvular (native valves), prosthetic (valves, patches and conduits), ventricular (especially chamber function), vascular (especially elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) and noncardiovascular residua and sequelae. Acquired cardiac and noncardiac diseases coexist in older adults with postoperative congenital heart disease and add to the physician's responsibilities. 
The mini-grommet and tympanosclerosis. One hundred and sixteen children with otitis media with effusion underwent myringotomy and insertion of a conventional pattern of Shah grommet in one ear and the much smaller Mini Shah grommet in the other. Close observation post-operatively determined the comparative rate of extrusion, recurrence of effusion, and of onset and degree of tympanosclerosis. At one year review, the Mini Shah shows a significantly earlier extrusion and a greater tendency to recurrence of otitis media with effusion. However, this is compensated by a decreased incidence of tympanosclerosis and reduced severity in those affected. This tends to support the view that shear forces produced by heavier patterns of ventilation tube promote tympanosclerosis. 
Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. 
A world record marathon runner with silent ischemia without coronary atherosclerosis. A 62-year-old world record marathon runner was found to have silent ischemia manifested by a very abnormal stress test, whereas at autopsy nine months later, there was virtually no coronary atherosclerosis nor other disease of the coronary microvasculature. However, there was focal fibrosis of the papillary muscles consistent with remote ischemia secondary to possible CV. It is postulated that endurance-related high catecholamine levels might have been responsible. 
Lack of ciprofloxacin ototoxicity after repeated ototopical application. The possible side effects of ototopically applied ciprofloxacin on inner ear function were investigated. The hearing function of pigmented guinea pigs was evaluated by daily frequency-specific evoked response audiometry after repeated application of the drug to both ears. Ciprofloxacin appeared to have no statistically significant effect on the hearing thresholds of the experimental animals. 
Risk factors for tunnel infections in continuous peritoneal dialysis. Little data are available about risk factors for peritoneal catheter subcutaneous tunnel infection. Therefore, we analyzed tunnel infections occurring in our program over a 10.5-year period. One hundred twenty-nine tunnel infections occurred in 92 of 411 patients (22%) on peritoneal dialysis for a mean of 19 +/- 19 months. Tunnel infection rate was 0.19 per year. By 1 year, 15% of patients had a tunnel infection, and by 2 years, 23%. Tunnel infection rates decreased with increasing time on peritoneal dialysis: 2.4 per year for patients on peritoneal dialysis less than 1 year, 0.8 per year for patients on dialysis 1 to 2 years, and 0.4 per year for patients on dialysis greater than 2 years (all different at P less than 0.01). Organisms were cultured in 109 tunnel infections: gram-positive cocci in 77 episodes (71%) [Staphylococcus aureus 57, 52%], and gram-negative bacilli in 24 episodes (22%). Tunnel infection rates were higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.27 per year v 0.16 per year, respectively; P less than 0.001 by life-table analysis of time to first infection) and also higher in women than in men (0.23 per year v 0.17 per year, P less than 0.001). Tunnel infection rates were 0.35 per year for diabetic women, 0.20 per year for diabetic men, 0.18 per year for nondiabetic women, and 0.15 per year for nondiabetic men (groups different, P less than 0.001). Race and age were similar in patients with and without tunnel infections. Catheter loss was 80% when tunnel infection was associated with peritonitis and 40% when tunnel infection alone was present (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the risk of tunnel infection is highest early in the course of peritoneal dialysis and that diabetic women, for unclear reasons, are at the highest risk. 
Assessment of normal and abnormal erectile function: color Doppler flow sonography versus conventional techniques. The penile arteries were studied with color Doppler flow sonography in 10 subjects with normal and 39 patients with abnormal erectile function. The relationships of systolic and diastolic velocities to spectral waveform changes in the penile arteries in response to tumescence were studied before and after intracorporal injection of vasoactive medications that induce erection. In normal subjects, a characteristic spectral waveform pattern corresponded to increasing intracorporal pressure. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and/or abnormal venous sinusoidal leakage demonstrated deviation from the patterns noted in normal subjects. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow had lower mean peak systolic velocities than normal subjects. Patients with severe venous sinusoidal incompetence had an arrest of waveform progression with evolution to but not beyond phases 1 or 2 (diastolic flow remained positive). Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and abnormal venous sinusoidal outflow had waveform changes that reflected both processes. Systolic/diastolic velocity and waveform relationships can be used to define the integrity of both the cavernosal artery inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow occlusion mechanisms. 
Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity. Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity occurring in up to 30% of women with metastatic disease. The prevalence of this lesion is not appreciated because of the dominant clinical picture of metastases occurring in other organs. The diagnosis should be suspected in any women with a history of breast cancer and any visual symptoms, particularly metamorphopsia and scotomata. A thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, aided by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance scanning, usually confirms the diagnosis. Early treatment with radiation therapy can alleviate symptoms and control local disease. The recognition and treatment of this disorder is important in maximizing the quality of life in patients with metastatic breast cancer, especially because newer treatment regimens prolong survival and thereby increase the chances for ocular metastasis. 
Incidental detection of a microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are uncommon. The two major types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms are microcystic (serous) cystadenoma and mucinous cystic lesions (mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma). The two types differ substantially in the long-term mortality. Symptoms and signs do not distinguish between the two types, and small lesions are often asymptomatic. The neoplasms may be discovered during imaging procedures for unrelated complaints. Computerized tomography may suggest the diagnosis of microcystic adenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm when the features are typical, but the final diagnosis must be established by surgical biopsy. Characteristic gross findings, light microscopic findings, and immunohistochemical staining patterns distinguish between the two types. When preliminary open biopsy confirms microcystic adenoma, extensive unnecessary surgery can be avoided. 
Effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine on isovolumic relaxation in the normal and failing human left ventricle. BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated acceleration of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic relaxation (i.e., positive lusitropic response) is attenuated in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with patients without LV dysfunction or CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS. The beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused by the intracoronary route in 14 subjects (normal group, six; CHF patients, eight) and by the intravenous route in a second group of 14 subjects (normal group, four; CHF patients, 10). The positive inotropic response to intracoronary or intravenous dobutamine was substantially and significantly reduced in the patients with CHF. LV isovolumic relaxation rate was determined by the methods of Weiss (TL), Mirsky (T1/2), and by a nonlinear regression technique (TNL). LV isovolumic relaxation assessed by all three methods was significantly prolonged in CHF patients compared with normal subjects. Intracoronary and intravenous infusions of dobutamine caused significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with CHF. The magnitude of the dobutamine-stimulated acceleration of isovolumic relaxation in patients with CHF was comparable with that in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with severe CHF. Coronary to our hypothesis, the lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is well preserved in patients with severe CHF despite substantial attenuation of the beta-adrenergic positive inotropic response. These findings have potentially important implications regarding the physiology and pharmacology of adrenergically mediated LV relaxation in humans. 
Dystrophin expression and somatic reversion in prednisone-treated and untreated Duchenne dystrophy. CIDD Study Group. The mechanism by which prednisone improves muscle strength and function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unknown. We addressed the possibility that clinical improvement was related to prednisone-induced alterations in skeletal muscle dystrophin. We performed muscle biopsies on patients at the conclusion of a randomized, double-blind, 6-month trial of prednisone and analyzed dystrophin content using Western blots and antibody staining of tissue sections. These studies demonstrated no significant differences in dystrophin content between treatment (prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d, n = 12; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d, n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. Of interest, however, was the presence of varying numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers (revertants) occurring individually or in clusters in antibody-stained tissue sections of more than one-half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions or duplications, and in nondeletion patients. Prednisone treatment did not influence the prevalence of revertants. Revertants are most likely due to a second-site mutation occurring in a somatic cell allowing for restoration of the translational reading frame of the dystrophin transcript. 
Dimethylformamide-induced liver damage among synthetic leather workers. Prevalence of liver injury associated with dimethylformamide (DMF) exposure was determined. Medical examinations, liver function tests, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations were performed on 183 of 204 (76%) employees of a synthetic leather factory. Air concentrations of solvents were measured with personal samplers and gas chromatography. The concentration of DMF in air to which each worker was exposed was categorized. High exposure concentrations of DMF (i.e., 25-60 ppm) were significantly associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (ALT greater than or equal to 35 IU/l), a result that did not change even after stratification by hepatitis B carrier status. Modeling by logistic regression demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of DMF was associated with an elevated ALT (p = .01), whereas hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was slightly but independently associated with an elevated ALT (p = .07). In those workers who had normal ALT values, there occurred still significantly higher mean ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, especially among those who were not HBsAg carriers. A significant association existed between elevated CPK levels and exposure to DMF. However, an analysis of the CPK isoenzyme among 143 workers did not reveal any specific damage to muscles. This outbreak of liver injury among synthetic leather workers is ascribed to DMF. It is recommended that the occupational standard for DMF and its toxicity among HBsAg carriers be evaluated further. 
Parathyroid hypertensive factor, a circulating factor in animal and human hypertension. A new circulating hypertensive factor (parathyroid hypertensive factor; PHF) was shown to exist in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in that of normotensive rats. PHF produced a delayed increase in blood pressure with a peak response at 45 min (bolus injection) or 60 to 90 min (continuous infusion). This increase in blood pressure was coupled with an in vitro increase in calcium uptake in rat tail artery with a similar time course. The involvement of calcium in the mechanism of action was supported by the inhibitory effect of calcium antagonists on the vascular action of PHF. Furthermore, PHF increased the intracellular free calcium concentration in cultured smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. Parathyroidectomy and parathyroid transplant experiments indicated the parathyroid origin of PHF. A culture of parathyroid glands from SHR, but not from normotensive rats, produced in the medium a factor which has the same biological property and HPLC retention time as plasma PHF. A novel cell type was described in the parathyroid gland of SHR, but not normotensive rats, and the percent of these cells correlated significantly with plasma PHF level and blood pressure. In some hyperparathyroid patients, plasma PHF and hypertension were found, both of which disappeared after surgical removal of the parathyroid gland. In both animal models and human studies, PHF seems to be associated with low or normal plasma renin and salt-sensitive type of hypertension. 
How well can radiographers triage x ray films in accident and emergency departments? [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):696] OBJECTIVE--To assess the ability of radiographers to identify abnormal radiographs of patients attending accident and emergency departments. DESIGN--Prospective study over six weeks. SETTING--Teaching hospital casualty x ray department. PATIENTS--3394 consecutive patients referred for radiography. INTERVENTIONS--Radiographs were assessed by radiographers who were offered a four point triage scheme: normal, abnormal, insignificantly abnormal, or further advice required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of radiographers' assessments with an assessment made independently by the reporting radiologists. RESULTS--Overall disagreement between the radiographers and radiologists was 9.4%. There were 7% false positives and 14% false negatives. Most errors occurred in assessing radiographs of the skull, facial bones, chest, abdomen, and soft tissues. CONCLUSION--Unselected radiographers can offer useful advice on radiographs to casualty officers, but their high rate of false positive diagnoses indicates that they cannot triage casualty radiographs sufficiently accurately to allow them to extend their current reporting role. 
Early treatment of ischemic stroke with a calcium antagonist. We performed a feasibility and safety study (phase II) of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, in 57 patients. The objectives of the study were to begin therapy as early as possible (less than or equal to 12 hours) after the onset of ischemic stroke and to administer as high a dose as possible. All patients received an intravenous infusion of nicardipine for 72 hours, starting with a dose of 3 mg/hr and increasing to a maximum dose of 7 mg/hr. Upward titration of the dose was limited by a 10% decrease in blood pressure or a 20 beats/min increase in pulse. Intravenous therapy was followed by 30 days of oral therapy. The mean +/- SD interval from onset of stroke to commencement of therapy was 9.1 +/- 5.4 hours. Adverse reactions consisted primarily of hypotension requiring discontinuation of therapy in four patients. Score on a graded neurologic examination increased from 41/100 at baseline to 64/100 at 3 months for the 41 patients completing follow-up. There was no correlation between the dose of nicardipine administered and outcome, but the 11 patients starting therapy less than or equal to 6 hours after onset did better than those starting therapy 6-12 hours after onset. Further study of very early therapy with nicardipine is justified. 
Should intravenous immunoglobulin G be first-line treatment for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? Case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and serious disease. Treatment with prednisone, anticoagulation, antiplatelet drugs, splenectomy, exchange transfusions, vincristine, and plasmapheresis may be effective in some patients, but the response to these therapies is inconsistent and all carry the potential for serious side effects. We, and others, have recently seen dramatic responses to intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) when other treatments have failed. Although IV IgG is expensive, its costs are low compared with those extended plasmapheresis regimens. Since the response to treatment can usually be evaluated within a few days and the side effects appear less than with other treatments, we believe a strong case can be made for the use of IV IgG as first-line therapy for acute TTP. Continued multicenter studies are necessary to finally solve the problem of competing and confusing treatment attempts and synergism of treatment in acute TTP. 
The prognostic value of deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometric analysis in stage D2 prostatic carcinoma. This study was designed to compare the prognostic potential of tumor grade and ploidy status in patients with stage D2 prostate cancer. Two outcome groups were selected on the basis of survival after orchiectomy: a bad outcome group consisting of 66 patients who died of the disease within 12 months and a good outcome group comprising 37 patients who survived beyond 5 years. Tumors were classified histologically as well (17%), moderately (17%) or poorly (66%) differentiated. Tumor grade was a significant predictor of outcome, with 76% of poorly differentiated tumors in the bad outcome group and 65% of well differentiated tumors in the good outcome group (p less than 0.005). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy analysis was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples of the primary tumor to yield 97 final tracings that were classified using set criteria for DNA ploidy status. Over-all, 54% of the tumors were nondiploid (33% aneuploid and 21% tetraploid) and the remaining 46% were diploid. DNA ploidy status was a significant indicator of outcome (p less than 0.001), with 64% of diploid tumors in the good outcome group and 88% of the nondiploid tumors in the poor outcome group. Tetraploid tumors behaved no differently from other nondiploid tumors. We conclude that DNA ploidy status and tumor grading are significant independent predictors of outcome after orchiectomy and when combined yield important additional prognostic information. 
Effects of milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular remodeling after an acute myocardial infarction may result in progressive left ventricular dilation that may be associated with increased mortality. We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats (n = 90) were randomized to undergo either left coronary artery ligation or sham operation. Three weeks after surgery, rats received either no treatment or milrinone, which was continued until 2 days before the rats were killed. Ninety days after the initial surgery, hemodynamic measurements were made before and after volume loading. The rats were killed, the hearts were removed, and passive pressure-volume curves were obtained. The hearts were fixed at a constant pressure and analyzed morphometrically. Compared with untreated infarcted rats, milrinone-treated infarcted rats had a lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (1.7 +/- 0.4 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), a lower left ventricular volume (1.25 +/- 0.20 versus 2.37 +/- 0.30 ml/kg, p less than 0.001) and a lower left ventricular wall stress index (1.3 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular chamber stiffness was higher in milrinone-treated infarcted rats than in untreated infarcted rats. Milrinone had no cardiac effect on uninfarcted animals. CONCLUSION. Chronic milrinone therapy after acute myocardial infarction improves cardiac hemodynamic indexes and attenuates progressive left ventricular dilation. 
Nongynecologic somatic pathology in women with chronic pelvic pain and negative laparoscopy. One hundred eighty-three women with chronic pelvic pain were referred to a multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain clinic after negative laparoscopy. One hundred twenty-two of them completed a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation and were followed for a minimum of six months after completion of therapy. Occult somatic pathology was diagnosed in 57 women (47%), including 19 in whom coexistent psychopathology was diagnosed. Myofascial pain was the most common somatic diagnosis, followed by atypical cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea or mittelschmerz); gastroenterologic, urologic and infectious diseases; and pelvic vascular congestion. No plausible somatic etiology was apparent in the remaining 65 (53%) of the 122 referrals. Nongynecologic somatic pathology accounted for 34 (29%) and gynecologic pathology for 23 (19%) of the referrals, only 6 (5%) of whom ultimately required hysterectomy. Women with a somatic diagnosis were found to be significantly older than the remainder of the referral population. Long-term symptomatic improvement or resolution of pain was obtained in 43 (75%) of the 57 patients with somatic diagnoses. Coexistent psychopathology was found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating and treating chronic pelvic pain in women and confirm that hysterectomy is indicated in this setting only rarely. 
Treatment of bone, joint, and vascular-access-associated gram-positive bacterial infections with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of vascular-access-associated bacteremias and of bone and joint infections due to susceptible gram-positive organisms. Of 35 patients enrolled, 26 had osteomyelitis, 8 had vascular-access-associated bacteremias, and 1 had a joint infection. A total of 38 gram-positive isolates were identified: 23 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 9 streptococcus isolates. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 17 patients were evaluable for efficacy: 10 of 14 (71%) with osteomyelitis and 3 of 3 with vascular-access-associated bacteremias had full resolution of their infections. Inadequate debridement, the presence of metal, and inadequate dosing were likely causes of two failures and two relapses in patients with osteomyelitis. For all but two organisms, teicoplanin MICs were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Patients who responded had median peak and trough serum bactericidal levels at serum dilutions of 1:64 and 1:16; trough levels of teicoplanin in serum were greater than 30 micrograms/ml. Patients did not respond as expected to daily doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight, which consequently were increased to greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Audiology testing of 20 patients found 2 with a mild loss of high-frequency hearing; 1 patient complained of tinnitus. Patients tolerated peak levels in serum as high as 127 micrograms/ml and trough levels of 49 micrograms/ml. However, 5 of 18 patients (28%) whose daily dose was greater than or equal to 12 mg/kg developed drug fever and rash and had teicoplanin discontinued. Further study of the antibiotic at such higher doses is needed. 
Effect of the calcium antagonist nicardipine hydrochloride on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. The calcium antagonist nicardipine was administered to 42 patients at a dose of 60 or 120 mg/day for an average of 7.8 weeks to determine its effects on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Glucose tolerance and immunoreactive insulin levels were essentially unchanged by nicardipine regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased in all patients. Concentrations of triglycerides decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in association with nicardipine administration. Therefore it is concluded that, regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance, nicardipine exerted hypotensive effects without significant adverse effects on glucose tolerance or insulin secretion. 
Monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials during surgery for middle cerebral artery aneurysms. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored during 53 procedures for aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). "Significant" changes were reported to the surgeon, who took corrective action when possible. Changes in the SEPs were categorized as follows: Type I, no change; Type II, significant change with complete return to baseline; Type III, significant change with incomplete return to baseline; Type IV, complete loss with no return; and Type V, no response at baseline. Only 1 of 37 patients with a Type I SEP had a new neurological deficit, and this was a patient who could not be examined for several days after surgery because he was in a pentobarbital coma. All 4 patients with Type III and IV changes had new postoperative neurological deficits. Perhaps of greater importance, 4 of 5 patients with Type II changes had no new deficit. These patients all had changes in SEPs that were completely reversible by clip adjustment (2), prompt removal of temporary clips (1), and inducing hypertension after aneurysm trapping (1). These cases may, therefore, represent instances in which SEP monitoring allowed the clinicians to prevent a neurological deficit. The MCA supplies the area of the somatosensory cortex that controls the hand. Median nerve SEPs are, therefore, a theoretically ideal monitor during surgery for MCA aneurysms. This study suggests that the results of MCA aneurysm surgery may be accurately predicted and improved with SEP monitoring. 
Clinical diagnosis for metastatic adenocarcinoma of spine of unknown origin. A comparative study. The diagnostic values of the presence of Virchow's node (VN) or rectal shelf (RS) in spinal metastasis from adenocarcinoma of unknown origin were studied prospectively in 60 patients during 1986-1988. These were compared with 14 cases with other malignancies of the spine and 37 controls with nonneoplastic spinal lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study in all malignant cases. The results were analyzed by diagnostic test analysis and McNemar chi 2 testing. This yields 18.3-21.6%, 97.2-100%, and 92.8-100% sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, respectively, for a positive test for VN and RS to differentiate significantly adenocarcinoma from other malignancies and control patients (P less than 0.005). These findings may thus be considered as a simple and economic guide for physicians to determine the proper approach to patients with a spinal lesion suspected to be malignant. 
Indirect laryngoscopic approach for injection of botulinum toxin in spasmodic dysphonia. Spasmodic dysphonia is a focal dystonia that causes a loss of the fine control of intrinsic laryngeal muscles and produces a strained staccato voice. Temporary relief from symptoms has been reported in patients treated with botulinum toxin percutaneously injected into the thyroarytenoid muscle. A newly developed method of treatment differs from reported methods by increasing the accuracy of botulinum toxin placement, reducing soft tissue trauma, and applying basic scientific information about the functional histology of intrinsic laryngeal musculature. Sixteen patients with primarily adductor spasmodic dysphonia were treated. Initial assessment included laryngeal examination by indirect laryngoscopy, videoendoscopy, and stroboscopy, neurology examination (including laryngeal EMG), and vocal function studies with acoustic analysis and aerodynamic studies. A device originally designed for collagen injection allowed the precise microdelivery of toxin to the thyroarytenoid muscle. Indirect laryngoscopy was used to direct the needle, in an attempt to cover a broad area of motor end plates. The minimally effective dose was titrated for each patient, to avoid paralysis and preserve laryngeal function. All patients showed improved voices after treatment. There were no major complications. The basic technique can be performed in the otolaryngologist's office and does not require electromyography equipment or expertise. 
A new approach to the differential diagnosis of a regular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex. BACKGROUND. In the differential diagnosis of a tachycardia with a wide QRS complex (greater than or equal to 0.12 second) diagnostic mistakes are frequent. Therefore, we investigated the reasons for failure of presently available criteria, and we identified new, simpler criteria and incorporated them in a stepwise approach that provides better sensitivity and specificity for making a correct diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. A prospective analysis revealed that current criteria had a poor specificity for the differential diagnosis. The value of four new criteria incorporated in a stepwise approach was prospectively analyzed in a total of 554 tachycardias with a widened QRS complex (384 ventricular and 170 supraventricular). The sensitivity of the four consecutive steps was 0.987, and the specificity was 0.965. CONCLUSIONS. Current criteria for the differential diagnosis between supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction and ventricular tachycardia are frequently absent or suggest the wrong diagnosis. The absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads is easily recognizable and highly specific for the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. When an RS complex is present in one or more precordial leads, an RS interval of more than 100 msec is highly specific for ventricular tachycardia. This new stepwise approach may prevent diagnostic mistakes. 
The infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon is frequently consulted to evaluate patients before the administration of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. Fifty consecutive patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania Oncology Center were studied before and during chemotherapy for adult leukemia or bone marrow transplantation. Otolaryngic history, physical examination, radiographic studies, and hematologic surveys were analyzed for the duration of therapy in an attempt to identify risk factors for infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications. Two-thirds of the patient studied experienced untoward effects that required the further attention of an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. The various complications and associated correlations with the study parameters before and during chemotherapy are discussed. 
Results of long-term rice bran treatment on stone recurrence in hypercalciuric patients. A series of 182 calcium stone formers with idiopathic hypercalciuria underwent treatment with rice bran for 1 to 94 months. Urinary calcium excretion was considerably reduced, but there was some increase in urinary phosphate and oxalate. Urinary excretion of magnesium and uric acid, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ALP was unaffected. There were no obvious changes in serum iron, zinc and copper even when patients were treated for long periods. Rice bran was well tolerated in almost all cases and there were no serious side effects; 49 patients have undergone treatment for more than 3 years (average duration of administration 5.09 years). The frequency of new stone formation was drastically reduced (individual stone formation rate (no./year) from 0.720 +/- 0.533 to 0.125 +/- 0.204; group stone formation rate (no./patient-year) from 0.721 to 0.120) compared with the 3-year period before treatment. During treatment, 61.2% of patients remained in remission. Although rice bran therapy should be effective in correcting absorptive hypercalciuria, there may be limits to the overall ability of rice bran monotherapy to prevent recurrence. 
Phase II trial of weekly or biweekly intraperitoneal mitoxantrone in epithelial ovarian cancer. Previous experimental and clinical evaluation has suggested that ovarian cancer is sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of mitoxantrone at concentrations achievable within the peritoneal cavity after intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Unfortunately, the use of the drug delivered IP at high doses (20 mg/m2 in 2 L normal saline [NS]) on a monthly schedule is compromised by severe local effects secondary to the irritant properties of the drug. To reduce toxicity and take advantage of minimal systemic drug exposure following IP administration, we treated 28 patients with a lower drug concentration of mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 in 2 L NS), but on a weekly or every other week schedule (total, 12 courses). Compared with the monthly program, this regimen caused less pain, allowed for a higher cumulative dose of mitoxantrone to be delivered, and resulted in less serious treatment-related morbidity. Four of 13 assessable patients (31%) whose largest tumor was less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter demonstrated a surgically defined response. All responding patients had failed previously or exhibited a minimal response to cisplatin. Despite the improved toxicity profile of this regimen, the overall response rate was similar to the monthly program, probably secondary to inadequate IP drug distribution in many patients. Future investigative efforts using IP mitoxantrone as therapy for ovarian cancer might focus on developing methods to improve drug delivery to all sites of tumor within the peritoneal cavity (eg, intraoperative therapy, increased treatment volumes, and antiinflammatory agents to reduce adhesion formation). 
The influence of the renin gene on alcohol consumption in Dahl rats. A rat renin allele (the S-allele) has been identified in Dahl rats which cosegregates with increases in blood pressure. Rats with a double dose of the allele--the salt-sensitive hypertensive rats--have low renin activity compared with the salt-resistant hypertensive rat that does not have this S-allele. Alcohol consumption in rats has also been shown to vary with renin activity, and the possible involvement of renin activity in the genetics of alcohol consumption was suggested by previous work showing that the alcohol-preferring P line of selected rats had low renin levels. In the present study we examined alcohol consumption in a group of inbred Dahl rats, which have a double dose of the S renin allele, and in a group of selected Dahl rats, which have only a single dose of this S-allele. After an initial acclimation period, these two groups were first given daily 1-hr access to ascending concentrations of alcohol (3%, 6%, 8% w/v) over a 34-day period followed by continuous access to alcohol for a further 10 days. Water and food were always available. Regardless of whether alcohol was rationed or continuously available, the rats with the double dose of the S-allele drank significantly more alcohol than the rats that had only a single dose of this allele. These findings suggest that genetically mediated alterations in the renin gene may exert a significant influence on alcohol consumption and may be a component in the etiology of alcoholism. 
Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 2: Preliminary clinical experience. Fifteen patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated using electrolytically detachable coils introduced via an endovascular approach. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 69 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was subarachnoid hemorrhage (eight cases). Considerable thrombosis of the aneurysm (70% to 100%) was achieved in all 15 patients, and preservation of the parent artery was obtained in 14. Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths. It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms. It may also play an important role in the occlusion of aneurysms in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
The impact of National Health Service Corps physicians in the lowering perinatal mortality rate in Dade County, Florida. In some parts of Dade County, Florida, perinatal mortality rates have revealed serious problems in the delivery of health care to poor pregnant women. From 1982-1985, the reported perinatal mortality rates varied from 32-36 per 1000 live births, more than double the national average. Under the leadership of the Primary Health Care Consortium of Dade County (a federation of community health centers and other primary care providers), National Health Service Corps obstetricians and pediatricians served inner-city, medically needy patients as part of a coordinated perinatal plan from 1987-1989. Data on fetal and neonatal deaths, collected from census tracts adjacent to the community health centers, were used to study the impact of Corps obstetrician and pediatrician placement. The respective perinatal mortality rates were compared with those of 1986 as historic controls. Within a year, the overall perinatal mortality rate was reduced by 45%. As a result, an estimated 320 lives were saved between 1987-1989. This public health achievement represents a measurable impact due to assignment of National Health Service Corps physicians and can be used as a working model to reduce perinatal mortality in medically underserved communities in the United States. 
Elevation of ambulatory systolic blood pressure in hypertensive smokers. A case-control study. Although smoking raises blood pressure, the office blood pressure measurements of smokers are the same as, or lower than, those of nonsmokers. To resolve this paradox, we compared the office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures of 59 untreated hypertensive smokers with 118 nonsmoking hypertensives matched for age, sex, and race. The office blood pressures of the smoking and nonsmoking groups were 141/93 and 142/93 mm Hg, respectively. The awake ambulatory systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the smokers (145 vs 140 mm Hg). This difference was greater among patients over the age of 50 years (153 vs 142 mmHg), and absent among patients under 50 years (140 vs 139 mm Hg). Blood pressures during sleep did not differ between the two groups (121/76 vs 123/77 mm Hg). We conclude that, among white hypertensives above the age of 50 years, smokers maintain a higher daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure than nonsmokers even though blood pressure measured in the office is similar. 
Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion as an initial manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri. Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is known to produce visual symptoms. Central retinal vein occlusion has been linked with pseudotumor cerebri but rarely as an initial manifestation. We describe a 46-year-old patient--who was obese and mildly hypertensive with bilateral central retinal vein occlusions--who was subsequently diagnosed as having pseudotumor cerebri. In patients with simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusions, unusual underlying systemic conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. 
Laser laparoscopic management of large endometriomas. Forty-seven patients underwent laser laparoscopic management of endometriomas from 3 to 12 cm in diameter. Eighteen patients had infertility, 15 had pelvic pain, and 14 had both. The types of laser used were the carbon dioxide, argon, and potassium-titanyl-phosphate. There were no surgical complications. Twelve of 32 patients with infertility achieved pregnancy after the initial procedure. Subsequently, 2 patients conceived after a second-look procedure. Twenty-three of 30 patients with pelvic pain reported improvement or resolution. We confirm the efficacy of operative laparoscopy using lasers in the management of large ovarian endometriomas. 
Serum cholesterol: attitudes and behavior of family practice residents BACKGROUND. Given the current health promotion efforts regarding coronary artery disease, more information is needed about residents' attitudes and behaviors that relate to identification and management of patients with elevated serum cholesterol levels. METHODS. Family practice residents from eight US programs (N = 128) were surveyed in 1989 to assess their attitudes and reported practice patterns. Resident survey data were compared, when feasible, to published data from 1986 and 1990 surveys of practicing physicians performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS. The use of faculty "key contacts" resulted in a 90% response rate (N = 115). Both residents and practicing physicians attributed a high degree of importance to cholesterol as a risk factor. Residents reported more frequent routine screening of middle-aged men than the routine screening rate of practicing physicians in 1986 (P less than .01). Residents reported less frequent screening of younger and older adults than of middle-aged men (P less than .001). Residents' threshold for the use of cholesterol-lowering medication was lower than that of practicing physicians surveyed in 1986, but higher than that of physicians surveyed in 1990. Compared with practicing physicians, residents did not believe they were as well prepared to counsel patients about dietary change or as successful when they tried to help patients make changes; residents reported a significantly higher rate of referral to dietitians (P less than .01). CONCLUSIONS. Residents may need more education regarding screening guidelines for children and young adults. A health promotion skills gap may exist that explains reported discrepancies between self-report and actual behavior and indicates that residency educators may need to pay more attention to fostering dietary assessment and counseling skills in their residents. 
Normal serum levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in mild to moderate essential hypertension. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a highly potent vasodilator, is expressed from the calcitonin-gene and has been localized to nerve fibers of the cardiovascular system, suggesting involvement in the physiologic regulation of vascular tone. In this investigation serum concentrations of CGRP were measured in patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO I-II) and compared with concentrations in sex- and age-matched normal controls to assess a possible relationship between changes in concentrations of CGRP and this condition. The study showed no significant difference in concentrations of CGRP between patients and the normotensive controls. However, a weak but significant positive correlation was found between systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressures (MBP), and circulating concentrations of CGRP when calculated for all individuals included in the study. No correlation was found between heart rates (HR) and concentrations of CGRP. In the normotensive control group, but not in patients with hypertension, a significant positive correlation was present between body weights and concentrations of CGRP. These findings do not support the hypothesis that low expression of CGRP plays a causal role in essential hypertension, but the results do not exclude a potential receptor defect for CGRP to be involved in the disease. 
Constitutive expression and role in growth regulation of interleukin-1 and multiple cytokine receptors in a biphenotypic leukemic cell line. A cell line (B1) was established from the bone marrow of a patient with a relapse of acute leukemia characterized by a 4;11 chromosomal translocation and biphenotypic features of early B and myeloid lineages. Analysis of the growth requirements of this cell line showed density-dependent growth and secretion of an autostimulatory growth factor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Several lines of evidence implicate the participation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the autocrine growth regulation of B1 cells. These cells constitutively express the messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-1 and IL-1 receptor and secrete IL-1; recombinant IL-1 stimulated the growth of colonies when cells were seeded at low density, and anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibited the growth of colonies with cells seeded at higher density. B1 cells do not express detectable levels of mRNA for any of the other cytokines tested, and other cytokines failed to support the growth of B1 cells at low density. In addition, B1 cells express multiple cytokine receptor genes, including the receptors for IL-6, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. Addition of the respective cytokines to the B1 cells resulted in inhibition of the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. The multiplicity of growth-inhibitory cytokine receptors on this leukemic cell line might be due to its biphenotypic lineage and may suggest new therapeutic possibilities in controlling leukemic cell proliferation. 
Cephalometric measurements in snorers, non-snorers, and patients with sleep apnoea. Cephalometry is often used to assess patients with sleep apnoea but whether these measurements differ from those in non-apnoeic snorers and how they are influenced by age is not clear. Cephalometric radiographs of patients with sleep apnoea were compared with those of snorers without sleep apnoea and those of non-snorers. Fifty two snorers with suspected sleep apnoea had a conventional sleep study and were divided into two groups: those with an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than 10/h (n = 40, sleep apnoea group) and those whose apnoea-hypopnoea index was 10/h or less (n = 12, snorer group). The cephalometric measurements in these patients were compared with those of 34 non-snoring control subjects. Controls were subdivided into two groups: control group 1 included 17 subjects similar in age to the sleep apnoea and snorer groups (mean (SD) age 50.0 (10.9), 50.7 (9.4), and 50.6 (9.7) years); control group 2 included 15 young men (25.4 (2.6) years). The distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H) and the length of the soft palate were greater in the patients with sleep apnoea (28.7 (7.8) and 43.6 (5.0) mm) than in the snorers (23.7 (4.2) and 40.3 (4.9 mm). The MP-H was similar in snorers and age matched control subjects, but was significantly greater in the older than in the younger control subjects (22.1 (6.1) vs 17.0 (6.8]. The soft palate was longer in subjects who snored (both sleep apnoea patients and snorers) than in control subjects. The MP-H distance significantly correlated with age for all subjects (snorers and controls) and for the control subjects alone. This study shows that non-apnoeic snorers have cephalometric abnormalities that differ from those of patients with sleep apnoea and that cephalometric values are influenced by the subject's age. 
Unexpected immunoreactivities of intermediate filament antibodies in human brain and brain tumors. Immunoreactivities of 35 different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that detect intermediate filaments were studied systematically on serial cryostat sections of 14 well-defined human gliomas (five astrocytomas, three oligodendrogliomas, six glioblastomas) and on normal brain. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and broad-specificity keratin MAbs, as well as MAbs that recognize several or only single keratin polypeptides, were used. Unexpected reactivities were surprisingly frequent. As these may lead to diagnostic confusion and misinterpretation on this material, the authors investigated these phenomena more thoroughly. Four major sources of artifactual staining were found: 1) positive staining attributable to the rabbit gamma G immunoglobulins used in the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique; 2) certain desmin and keratin MAbs cross-reacted with astrocytic glia and with other brain-specific epitopes; 3) technical difficulties; 4) some MAbs directed against neurofilaments and keratins showed unexpected reactivities only on individual anaplastic gliomas. The implications of these findings for intermediate filament typing of neuropathologic material are discussed. 
A novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders produced in rats by partial sciatic nerve injury. Partial nerve injury is the main cause of causalgiform pain disorders in humans. We present here a novel animal model of this condition. In rats we unilaterally ligated about half of the sciatic nerve high in the thigh. Within a few hours after the operation, and for several months thereafter, the rats developed guarding behavior of the ipsilateral hind paw and licked it often, suggesting the possibility of spontaneous pain. The plantar surface of the foot was evenly hyperesthetic to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. None of the rats autotomized. There was a sharp decrease in the withdrawal thresholds bilaterally in response to repetitive Von Frey hair stimulation at the plantar side. After a series of such stimuli in the operated side, light touch elicited aversive responses, suggesting allodynia to touch. The withdrawal thresholds to CO2 laser heat pulses were markedly lowered bilaterally. Suprathreshold noxious heat pulses elicited exaggerated responses unilaterally, suggesting thermal hyperalgesia. Pin-prick evoked such exaggerated responses bilaterally (mechanical hyperalgesia). In a companion report, we show that these abnormalities critically depend on the sympathetic outflow. Based on the immediate onset and long-lasting perpetuation of similar symptoms, such as touch-evoked allodynia and hyperalgesia, and the resemblance of the contralateral phenomena to 'mirror image' pains in some humans with causalgia, we suggest that this preparation may serve as a model for syndromes of the causalgiform variety that are triggered by partial nerve injury and maintained by sympathetic activity. 
Susceptibility of normal human joint tissue to viruses. A model system has been developed to investigate the comparative ability of different viruses to replicate and persist intraarticularly. The viruses chosen for study were rubella, mumps, Coxsackie B4, adenovirus and varicella zoster, a selection of viruses with different degrees of association with joint symptoms in clinical studies. Our results showed that these viruses demonstrated a range of abilities to infect and persist in human joint tissue cultured in vitro. The most arthritogenic viruses, rubella, and to a lesser extent mumps, replicated and penetrated deeply into the synovial membrane. In contrast, the other 3 viruses were much less arthrotropic, and may only induce arthritis by immunopathological mechanisms. 
Intermittent claudication as a manifestation of silent myocardial ischemia: a pilot study. One hundred consecutive patients with intermittent claudication were screened noninvasively with electrocardiography chest wall mapping stress test and transcutaneous aortovelography during bicycle ergometry. Electrocardiographic chest wall stress testing indicated three-vessel coronary disease in 25 patients and left anterior descending plus circumflex (left main stem equivalent) disease in seven. In these 32 patients transcutaneous aortovelography demonstrated a decrease in stroke distance (an index of cardiac stroke volume) (median, -28%; 90% range, +5% to -48%), and coronary angiography confirmed the presence and severity of the disease. The claudication distance ranged between 50 and 250 meters. After myocardial revascularization or medical therapy a significant increase occurred in the stroke distance after exercise (median, +20; 90% range, +40% to -25%); also a significant increase in the postexercise pressure index and a reduction in the recovery time (p less than 0.01). No change occurred in the ankle/pressure index at rest. Twelve patients were able to walk without being limited by claudication; 15 reported improvement with a two to tenfold increase in claudication distance. No change occurred in three. The results indicate that silent myocardial ischemia is a common finding in patients with intermittent claudication. It produces left ventricular dysfunction and a decrease in stroke volume leading to a large fall in ankle pressure and early onset of claudication during exercise. Niltrates and myocardial revascularization tend to reverse this. 
Intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy. Five children (three boys, two girls) presenting in the first year of life with intractable diarrhoea had a number of features in common. All had ulcerating stomatitis, four had partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy, all had colitis characterised by large ulcers with overhanging edges, and four had severe perianal disease; no stool pathogens were detected. Treatment with steroids, sulphasalazine, and azathioprine was unsuccessful. All five required subtotal colectomy. Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese. Although the diagnoses of Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease were considered, it appears that these children represent a distinct inherited condition affecting the whole gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon. 
Improving survival in gastric cancer: review of operative mortality in English language publications from 1970. In this review of English language publications from 1970, operative mortality following surgery for gastric cancer has been analysed. Operative mortality has declined in series reporting operations in successive decades to 1970, 1980 and 1990. Series reporting patients having surgery for gastric cancer in the decade to 1990 show a mean operative mortality rate of 7.8 per cent (median 4.6 per cent). This improvement may have contributed to the declining mortality rates for gastric cancer in the face of unchanging surgical workload. Results of operations for gastric cancer should be reported in a standard manner. 
Aetiological parallel between anal cancer and cervical cancer. It has been postulated that an infectious agent and/or specific sexual behaviour is involved in the aetiology of anal cancer, in analogy with the aetiology established for cancer of the cervix. A case-control study of 29,648 women with cancers registered in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968-87 tested the hypothesis that anal cancer patients were more likely than patients with colon, stomach, or vulva cancer to have had a previous diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer. The odds ratio of CIN, adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, for anal vs colon cancer was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-8.3), that for anal vs stomach cancer 3.6 (2.1-6.0), and that for anal vs vulva cancer 1.6 (0.9-2.9). The median time from diagnosis of CIN to diagnosis of the registered cancer was 151 months for anal, 112 months for vulva, 114 months for colon, and 126 months for stomach cancer. The association with previous invasive cervical cancer was also investigated; no patient with cervical cancer in this second analysis had been included in the CIN analysis. The odds ratios were similar. In addition, anal cancer patients were significantly more likely to have had cervical cancer than were patients with vulva cancer (odds ratio 1.8 [1.0-3.9]). The strong association between anal cancer and CIN/invasive cervical cancer suggests that these cancers share common risk factors. The association is at least as strong as that between cervical and vulva cancer. 
Reversible tricuspid stenosis. Demonstration with two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler. We report a case of pseudo-tricuspid stenosis as a result of extrinsic compression of the tricuspid valve by a large right-sided pericardial effusion. Two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler enabled accurate noninvasive diagnosis and hemodynamic assessment. 
Positive serum antibody and negative tissue staining for Helicobacter pylori in subjects with atrophic body gastritis. Helicobacter pylori is rarely found in gastric biopsy specimens from individuals with atrophic gastritis of the body mucosa. To determine if subjects with atrophic body gastritis have evidence of previous infection with H. pylori, immunoglobulin G antibody to H. pylori was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera of 399 Finnish subjects. In 124 subjects, multiple biopsy specimens from body and antrum had been evaluated for the presence of H. pylori by Giemsa staining. Antibody correlated well with H. pylori staining except in the subgroup with atrophic body gastritis, in whom the prevalence of seropositivity (86%) was significantly greater than the prevalence of positive staining (33%) (P less than 0.001). Twenty-five subjects had positive antibody and negative staining. This group had a significantly higher prevalence of atrophic body gastritis (80%), lower maximal acid output, lower serum pepsinogen I levels, and higher serum gastrin concentrations than did seropositive subjects with H. pylori. These data suggest that most patients with atrophic body gastritis, despite having a low incidence of current overt infection, have been infected with H. pylori at some point in their lives. 
Superoxide production by Crohn's disease neutrophils. Neutrophil superoxide anion production was measured in healthy subjects and in patients with quiescent and active Crohn's disease using superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome C reduction. Three stimuli were used: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA1), phorbol 20-oxo-20-deoxy 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA2), and Candida albicans in serum. Normal neutrophils produced significantly more superoxide anion than Crohn's disease neutrophils with both PMA1 (mean (SD) 9.6 (2.2) v 8.6 (1.8) nmol/10(6) cells/5 minutes, p = 0.04) and PMA2 (1.8 (0.8) v 0.8 (0.77) nmol/10(6) cells/5 minutes, p = 0.00004). With C albicans in serum, normal and Crohn's disease neutrophils produced similar amounts of superoxide anion (4.4 (1.5) v 4.3 (1.7) nmol/10(6) cells/30 minutes, not significant). Results were independent of disease activity. Superoxide anion production by PMA-stimulated Crohn's disease neutrophils is significantly lower than by normal neutrophils. 
Increased circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in persons with pheochromocytomas. To investigate the possible relationship of hypertension and the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which contains two peptides [i.e. pro ANF-(1-30) and pro-ANF-(31-67)] with blood pressure-lowering effects, we examined the circulating levels of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone in three patients with pheochromocytomas before surgery, during an increase in their blood pressure with surgical manipulation of their tumors, and after surgery when their blood pressures returned to normal. The circulating levels of the whole N-terminus [amino acids 1-98; pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) from the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone were increased 2-fold in patients with both extraadrenal and intraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In both the intraadrenal and extraadrenal patients N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) circulating levels increased further during surgical manipulation and returned to normal after surgical removal of their respective tumors. Each of these pheochromocytomas was found to have pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67)-binding sites that were functional, since they could enhance the guanylate cyclase-cGMP system 2-fold in these pheochromocytomas. The entire 126 amino acids of the prohormone were present within each of the pheochromocytomas, since both the whole N-terminus and C-terminus (i.e. ANF) of the prohormone were present. Examination of the pheochromocytomas by electron microscopy revealed electron-dense granules similar to those in the heart, which have been associated with the synthesis and storage of the ANF prohormone. We conclude that 1) the whole N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) of the ANF prohormone circulate at higher concentrations in persons with pheochromocytomas and return to normal with removal of the tumors; 2) pheochromocytomas contain specific binding sites for pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67); 3) these binding sites are functional, since pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67) could enhance the enzyme guanylate cyclase within these tumors; and 4) the entire 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present within these tumors, which have electron-dense granules associated with polypeptide hormone synthesis, suggesting that the ANF prohormone is being synthesized within the pheochromocytomas. 
Use of human recombinant erythropoietin to correct severe preoperative anemia. The risks of homologous blood transfusion are well known. Herein, we describe the successful preoperative use of human recombinant erythropoietin to correct severe anemia in a patient refusing transfusion. This case report emphasizes the important perioperative role human recombinant erythropoietin may play in the future. 
Cancer staging may have different meanings in academic and community hospitals. We investigated differences in lung cancer care and outcome between academic and community settings for all lung cancer patients diagnosed during 1973-1976 in New Hampshire and Vermont. Trained abstracters reviewed hospital charts to record personal, diagnostic, and clinical information, and survival was determined for all patients through the end of 1979. Patients diagnosed in university hospital cancer centers underwent more staging procedures and tended to be assigned to a higher stage than similar patients diagnosed in community hospitals. When tumor stage was considered as a covariable in a survival analysis, these patients appeared to have a lower mortality rate both for non-small cell tumors (mortality rate ratio, 95% confidence interval = 0.81, 0.71-0.91) and for small cell tumors (0.71, 0.55-0.91). When functional status rather than tumor stage was used to adjust for disease severity, there was no apparent survival advantage for university patients with non-small cell cancer (0.96, 0.85-1.09) and the lower mortality for small cell cancers (0.76, 0.59-0.97) was attenuated, although still statistically significant. We conclude that inconsistently-collected data on clinical stage can complicate comparisons of prognosis between cancer patients from different types of hospitals and that measures of performance status may be more useful indicators of disease severity in population based studies. 
Changes in intracranial CSF volume after lumbar puncture and their relationship to post-LP headache. Post-lumbar puncture (LP) headache may be due to "low CSF pressure", leading to stretching of pain sensitive intracranial structures. The low intracranial pressure is secondary to net loss of intracranial CSF. It has, however, not been possible to measure intracranial CSF volume accurately during life until recently. Intracranial CSF volume can now be measured non-invasively by a MRI technique. The changes in intracranial CSF volume were studied in 20 patients who had LP. Total intracranial CSF volume was reduced in 19 of the 20 patients 24 hours after LP (range -1.8 mls to -158.6 mls). Most of the CSF was lost from the cortical sulci. Very large reductions in intracranial CSF volume were frequently related to post-LP headache but some patients developed headache with relatively little alteration in the intracranial CSF volume. There was not a measurable change in position of the intracranial structures following LP. 
Prognostic value of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in gastric carcinoma. A new monoclonal antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), PC10, which can be used on routinely processed tissue, was applied to 93 cases of gastric carcinoma. Significant intra-tumoural variation in staining occurred. In addition to a PCNA index (percentage of positive cells per 1000 tumour cells), a semiquantitative PCNA grading system was devised, based on estimates of less than or more than 50% of positive tumour cells in whole sections. Neither PCNA index nor PCNA grade showed any correlation with established histological variables, tumour stage, or the presence of lymph node metastases. No significant correlation was observed between PCNA index and S + G2M phase fraction measured by flow cytometric analysis. To analyse survival tumours with PCNA indices above and below the median level (41%) were compared. Those with a higher index tended to have a worse prognosis, but when PCNA grade was considered, it was found to have definite independent prognostic value, tumours of low grade surviving better than those of high grade. The ability of semiquantitative PCNA grading to allow for intra-tumoural variation suggests it may have advantages over absolute counting, which is prone to sampling error when tumour heterogeneity is a major factor. The prognostic value of PC10 staining in gastric carcinoma is therefore promising. 
Renal oncocytomas--an Australian experience. A review was made of 24 cases of renal oncocytoma seen between 1978 and 1989. There was considerable overlap between the clinical presentation of renal oncocytomas and renal carcinomas. Although pre-operative radiological, cytological and pathological investigations may suggest the presence of an oncocytoma, these studies cannot make a definitive diagnosis. We recommend that these tumours be treated as potential renal carcinomas until post-operative microscopic evaluation proves otherwise. 
Transient myocardial ischemia during daily life in rest and exertional angina pectoris and comparison of effectiveness of metoprolol versus nifedipine. The clinical characteristics of 65 patients with mixed angina were classified by means of (1) a questionnaire investigating the proportion of symptoms occurring at rest and on effort, (2) an exercise stress test, (3) 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, and (4) coronary arteriography. According to the questionnaire, the proportion of effort-induced anginal episodes ranged from 1 to 99%. The ischemic threshold during exercise testing ranged from 110 x 10(2) to 350 x 10(2) mm Hg x beats/min. At least 1 episode of ST-segment depression was observed in 29 of the 65 patients during Holter monitoring. Ischemic episodes during Holter monitoring were more frequent (p less than 0.05) in patients reporting greater than or equal to 50% of anginal attacks on effort, with moderate to severe limitation of exercise capacity and with multivessel coronary artery disease. The effect on ambulatory ischemia of a 6-week treatment with a beta blocker (metoprolol CR, 200 mg once daily) or a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (nifedipine retard 20 mg twice daily) were then compared according to a double-blind, parallel group design. Metoprolol significantly reduced the number and duration of the ischemic episodes during daily life (p less than 0.05) irrespective of the patients' clinical characteristics. Nifedipine was ineffective, particularly in patients with angina predominantly on effort and with a moderate to severe reduction in exercise tolerance. It is concluded that in patients with mixed angina, ischemic episodes during daily life are more likely to occur in patients with a clinical presentation suggesting poor coronary reserve. 
Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic neoplasms. In closing, it is important to note that the indications for liver transplantation are not static but rather are remarkably dynamic and capable of change over time. Thus yesterday's major indications can become relative contraindications, while yesterday's absolute contraindications have become today's nuisances. The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care. 
The value of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for acute conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm. In a single-blind randomized study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg body weight per 10 min) versus flecainide (2 mg/kg per 10 min) were assessed in 50 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 h. Conversion to sinus was achieved in 11 (55%) of 20 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with propafenone and in 18 (90%) of 20 with atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide (p less than 0.02). If atrial fibrillation was present less than or equal to 24 h, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in the propafenone group and 13 (93%) of 14 in the flecainide group (p less than 0.05). Atrial flutter was converted in two (40%) of five patients treated with propafenone and in one (20%) of five with flecainide (p = NS). Mean time to conversion was 16 +/- 10 min in the propafenone group versus 18 +/- 13 min in the flecainide group (p = NS). QRS lengthening (83 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 20 ms) was observed only in the patients treated with flecainide (p less than 0.001). Patients successfully treated with propafenone showed significantly higher plasma levels than those whose arrhythmia did not convert to sinus rhythm. Transient adverse effects were more frequent in the flecainide group (40%) than in the propafenone group (8%) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 min, flecainide is more effective than propafenone for conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. However, considering the propafenone plasma levels and very few adverse effects, the dose or infusion rate, or both, used in the propafenone group may not have been sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Neither drug seems very effective in patients with atrial flutter. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and t-PA treatment. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been approved as thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, but this agent can cause serious bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhages. Mechanisms underlying the development of these hemorrhages have not been clarified. We report a patient who developed two intracerebral hemorrhages shortly after receiving t-PA for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction, and who was found to have cerebral amyloid angiopathy at autopsy. Staining of cortical sections with Congo red and an antibody directed against beta amyloid protein (A4 peptide) disclosed specific involvement of most of the subarachnoid and superficial cortical vessels in the region of the two hemorrhages. Based on the findings in this patient and in 6 additional patients reported recently, it is likely that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays a pathogenic role in some intracerebral hemorrhages associated with the administration of t-PA. The cautious use of t-PA with heparin in patients who are elderly or demented may be advisable. 
The initiation of failure in cemented femoral components of hip arthroplasties. We studied 16 femora retrieved at post-mortem from symptomless patients who had a satisfactory cemented total hip arthroplasty from two weeks to 17 years earlier, with the aim of delineating the initial mechanisms involved in loosening. Only one specimen showed radiographic evidence of loosening; the other 15 were stable to mechanical testing at 17.0 Nm of torque. In all 16 specimens, the cement-bone interface was intact with little fibrous tissue formation. By contrast, separation at the cement-prosthesis interface and fractures in the cement mantle were frequent. The most common early feature was debonding of the cement from the metal, seen at the proximal and distal ends of the prosthesis. Specimens which had been in place for longer also showed circumferential fractures in the cement, near the cement-metal interface, and radial fractures extending from this interface into the cement and sometimes to the bony interface. The most extensive cement fractures appeared to have started at or near sharp corners in the metal, or where the cement mantle was thin or incomplete. Fractures were also related to voids in the cement. The time relationship in this series suggested that long-term failure of the fixation of cemented femoral components was primarily mechanical, starting with debonding at the interface between the cement and the prosthesis, and continuing as slowly developing fractures in the cement mantle. 
Epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS). With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively. Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments. 
Surgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. 
Surgically induced endometriosis does not alter peritoneal factors in the rabbit model. OBJECTIVE: It was the purpose of this study to examine the cause and effect relationship between alterations in peritoneal factors and the presence of ectopic endometrium in the rabbit model. DESIGN: Forty rabbits had autologous endometrial or omental (control) tissue surgically implanted. Peritoneal fluid (PF) volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation, as well as the number of implants with adhesions, were compared with values obtained during the initial surgery. The effect of hormonal treatment on these factors was evaluated at a third laparotomy. RESULTS: There was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of adhesions in animals with endometrial implants. Peritoneal fluid volume, macrophage number, or macrophage activation were not increased in rabbits with endometrial implants as compared with controls, nor was there a response to hormonal manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PF volume, macrophage number, and macrophage activation are not altered by endometrial implants in the rabbit model. This suggests that the increase in these peritoneal factors in women with endometriosis may not be caused exclusively by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue. 
Jugular venous 'a' wave in dilated cardiomyopathy: sign of abbreviated right ventricular filling time. OBJECTIVE--To study the mechanisms underlying the high venous pressure often seen in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN--Retrospective and prospective examination of the pattern of flow in the superior vena cava, cardiac echo-Doppler studies, and recordings of the jugular venous pulse. SETTING--A tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS--23 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. RESULTS--Two patterns of venous pulse were seen: a dominant 'a' wave and 'x' descent, with systolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 1, n = 11), and a dominant 'v' wave with 'y' descent and diastolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 2, n = 12). A comparison of group 1 and group 2 showed: age (mean (SD] 58 (12) v 61 (6) years, left ventricular end diastolic dimension 7.0 (0.7) cm in both groups, right ventricular short axis 3.3 (0.6) v 3.6 (0.5) cm and long axis 7.3 (0.5) v 7.1 (0.7) cm, and duration of tricuspid regurgitation 350 (65) v 370 (50) ms. The RR interval (550 (100) v 680 (80) ms) and right ventricular filling time (150 (30) v 290 (50) ms) were significantly shorter in group 1. In all patients in group 2 right ventricular filling time was more than 200 ms with separate E and A waves on the tricuspid Doppler echocardiogram, while in all group 1 patients it was less than 200 ms with a single summation peak. In nine patients in group 1, the right ventricular filling time was limited by prolonged tricuspid regurgitation and in the remaining two by prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (215 (80) ms), so that it was consistently significantly less than that of the left ventricle. CONCLUSION--In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, right ventricular filling time may be so short that it limits stroke volume. Such patients can be recognised by a dominant 'a' wave on the jugular venous pulse. Patients in whom the right ventricular filling time was longer showed a dominant 'v' wave. Both groups can present as "congestive heart failure". 
Impaired response of atrial natriuretic factor to blood volume expansion in acute right ventricular infarction. To assess the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in right ventricular (RV) infarction, 30 patients with inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (15 with RV involvement) and normal left heart filling pressures were studied 39 +/- 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Serial measurements of cardiac output, right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures, as well as plasma ANF, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and vasopressin were obtained before and 30 minutes after acute volume expansion to raise wedge pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. Baseline mean right atrial pressure and plasma ANF levels were greater in patients with than without RV infarction (8 +/- 3 vs 5 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001, and 4.6 +/- 2.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/ml; p less than 0.05, respectively). There were no differences in other baseline hemodynamic or humoral parameters between both groups. After volume expansion, pulmonary wedge pressure was similar in both groups, but right atrial pressure increased to higher levels in patients with RV infarction (19 +/- 2 vs 14 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001). Despite this greater stimulus for ANF secretion, the increase in plasma ANF was less pronounced in patients with RV infarction (63 +/- 81 vs 455 +/- 417%; p less than 0.002), especially among those with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thus, despite higher baseline plasma levels of ANF, response to volume loading is markedly attenuated in patients with RV infarction complicating an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction. 
Relative importance of eight virulence characteristics of pyelonephritogenic Escherichia coli strains assessed by multivariate statistical analysis. We have previously reported univariate statistical analysis of the prevalences of putative virulence determinants in Escherichia coli isolated from children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. The expression of P-fimbriae, cell surface hydrophobicity, mannose resistant haemagglutination, haemolysin synthesis, cytotoxic necrotizing factor production and aerobactin mediated iron uptake occurred more often in a collection of 115 Escherichia coli strains isolated from children and women with acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis compared to 96 strains isolated from the commensal fecal flora. With the aim to study which of these virulence markers were independently associated with strains causing infection we performed a multivariate statistical analysis with the data from these strains. The previously proposed virulence factors, expression of type 1 fimbriae and adhesion to HeLa cells were also included in the analysis. P-fimbriae, mannose resistant haemagglutination and the production of haemolysin were, in the multivariate analysis, associated with strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis. 
Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the sensation of warmth as a method of detecting inadvertent subarachnoid injection of local anaesthetic when performing extradural blocks. In order to test if the rate of onset of sensation of warmth in the legs after the injection of 0.5% bupivacaine might discriminate between subarachnoid and extradural injection, 150 urological patients were allocated randomly to receive either spinal anaesthesia with isobaric (IS) or hyperbaric (HS) 0.5% bupivacaine, or extradural anaesthesia with isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine. The volume of the local anaesthetic for spinal anaesthesia and for the extradural test dose was 3-4 ml. The patients were asked to report at once if they had a sensation of warmth in the legs during or after injection of local anaesthetic. The mean time to the sensation of warmth was significantly shorter in the spinal groups (80 (SEM 10) s in IS and 76 (8.0) s in HS) than in the extradural group (558 (38) s). However, six patients in the IS and two in the HS group had no sensation of warmth. 
Recommendations for preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus to patients during exposure-prone invasive procedures. This document has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to update recommendations for prevention of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the health-care setting. Current data suggest that the risk for such transmission from a health-care worker (HCW) to a patient during an invasive procedure is small; a precise assessment of the risk is not yet available. This document contains recommendations to provide guidance for prevention of HIV and HBV transmission during those invasive procedures that are considered exposure-prone. 
The value of pancreatic pseudocyst amylase concentration in the detection of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct. The aims of the study were to compare the results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous cystopancreatography (PCP) in the detection of the communication between the pancreatic pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct, and to assess the reliability of the increased amylase concentration in the pseudocyst content as an indicator of the existence of communication between the pancreatic pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct system. Forty-three patients were included in the study. Pseudocystic fluid content was obtained by percutaneous aspiration. Twenty-four patients had pseudocyst amylase concentrations above 64 Wolgemuth units (WU), and 19 patients had less than 64 WU. The communication between pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct was determined in 22 patients by ERCP and in 13 patients by PCP, all in the group with increased pseudocyst amylase concentration. Due to high sensitivity and specificity of pseudocyst amylase concentration for the existence of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct, we conclude that guided percutaneous aspiration of the pancreatic pseudocyst with the determination of amylase concentration in the fluid can replace ERCP as a method of choice for the detection of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct. 
Intestinal injury after lumbar discectomy. In a review of 5,200 lumbar discectomies performed from 1974 to 1989, two patients sustained a ventral perforation of the disc space followed by isolated small intestinal injury. Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation. At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily. The patients had an uneventful recovery. The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine. Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury. After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections. Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration. A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication. 
Salvage of nonunion following ankle arthrodesis for failed total ankle arthroplasty. Revision operations for nonunion following total ankle arthrodesis for total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) were reviewed in ten patients. Operations averaged 2.0 years after prior arthrodesis attempts and featured external fixation in seven, internal fixation in one, percutaneous pin fixation in one, and cast immobilization only in one. Bone graft was used in seven. Union was achieved in 78%. The one complication was an infection in a patient with prior sepsis. The results were considered excellent in three, good in one, fair in three, and poor in two of the nine patients with adequate follow-up evaluation (average, 7 years). Despite successful arthrodesis, residual symptoms were common because of factors such as hindfoot degenerative arthritis and malalignment. 
Serum vitamin D metabolites and bone mineralization in young children with chronic low to moderate lead exposure. One hundred five children (49 male, 99 black) with known lead exposure indices from birth and adequate nutrient intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D were studied at 1 of 3 ages (21, 27, or 33 months) to determine the effects of chronic low to moderate lead exposure on circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and bone mineral content as determined by photon absorptiometry. Univariate multiple regression analyses showed no direct relationship of blood lead levels to vitamin D metabolites or bone mineral content. Structural equation analyses which took into account potential covariates of age, season, race, and sex showed estimated declines in serum concentrations of total calcium (from 9.72 to 9.61 mg/dL), phosphorus (from 5.4 to 4.67 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (from 27.24 to 25.8 ng/mL) and estimated increases in concentrations of parathyroid hormones (from 73.03 to 83.14 microL Eq/mL), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (from 62.39 to 62.69 pg/mL), and bone mineral content (from 222.66 to 234.91 mg/cm) over the observed range of average lifetime blood lead concentrations (4.76 to 23.61 micrograms/dL, geometric mean 9.74 micrograms/dL). However, the only statistically significant effect of average lifetime blood lead concentration was that for phosphorus, and the multivariate test of the combined effects of lead on these six outcomes was not statistically significant (P = .2). It is concluded that significant alterations in vitamin D metabolism, calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and bone mineral content are not present in children whose nutritional status is adequate and who experience low to moderate lead exposure. 
A weekly cisplatin-based induction regimen for extensive non-small cell lung cancer. A Southwest Oncology Group study. The purpose of this Phase II pilot study was to determine whether a dose-intensive regimen of weekly cisplatin combined with other active non-cross-resistant agents would improve the response rate and survival time of patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received cisplatin (50 mg/m2/wk) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 36, 43, 50, and 57 combined with mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on days 1 and 36, vinblastine (3 mg/m2) on days 8 and 43, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 g/m2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours on days 15 and 50. Responding patients received consolidation therapy with cisplatin and etoposide (VP-16). Of 82 registered patients, 80 were eligible and 77 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 23% with 1 patient achieving a complete response (CR) and 17 patients achieving a partial response (PR). The median survival time was 4.6 months. The toxicity profile was not different from that described for standard-dose regimens. Although this regimen does not offer any benefit over standard-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with extensive non-small lung cancer, the weekly schedule permits a dose-intensive regimen with acceptable toxicity for tumors that may benefit from this approach. 
Increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. It has been suggested that immunological mechanisms involving lymphocyte-mediated damage are important in the characteristic bile-duct damage that occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because adhesion is necessary for the interaction of lymphocytes with their target structures, we have studied the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, a ligand for the leukocyte adhesion receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 in the liver of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was seen on interlobular bile ducts and proliferating bile ductules in both conditions. In primary biliary cirrhosis, medium-sized ducts, which are spared by the disease, were negative. Minimal bile-duct staining was seen in conditions in which bile-duct damage is not a major feature, such as nonbiliary cirrhosis and acute liver diseases. In patients with cirrhosis from any cause, strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was detected on the periseptal hepatocytes adjacent to new connective tissue. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining was recorded using a semiquantitative visual scoring system that was subsequently validated quantitatively by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The expression/induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on bile ducts may be important in the pathogenesis of bile-duct damage in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and is further evidence to support an immune pathogenesis in these two conditions. Furthermore, the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes may be an important factor in the liver-cell damage and fibrosis that occur during the development of cirrhosis. 
Salvage of thrombosed forearm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular access grafts by reversal of flow direction and venous bypass grafting. A technique is described for salvage of looped forearm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts that fail because of thrombosis due to cephalic vein outflow obstruction. It entails reversal of blood flow direction through the graft and construction of a new venous outflow in the medial upper arm. This procedure was performed in nine patients and, at the present time, has increased the graft life by an average of 6.2 months (range: 2 to 14 months) in eight. We conclude that this is a useful alternative to abandoning failed looped forearm PTFE grafts that have cephalic vein outflow obstruction. 
A comparison of dopexamine and dopamine to prevent renal impairment in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. The efficacy of low-dose dopamine as a renal protective agent was compared with that of dopexamine in patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve patients who received a continuous infusion of dopexamine (1-3 micrograms/kg/minute) were matched for age, diagnosis, pre-operative creatinine clearance and blood loss with 12 patients who received a low-dose infusion of dopamine (2 micrograms/kg/minute). The catecholamine infusion was started after induction of anaesthesia and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Patients in the dopexamine group had less evidence of renal impairment and failure than those in the dopamine group during 7 days after the operation, although the differences between groups did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly there were no significant differences between the two groups in peri-operative urine output, urine/plasma osmolality ratio or creatine clearance. Dopexamine is at least as effective as dopamine for renal protection in patients who undergo liver transplantation. 
Alteration of urinary carnitine profile induced by benzoate administration. To study the effect of sodium benzoate on carnitine metabolism, the acylcarnitine profile in the urine of five normal volunteers and two patients with urea cycle disorders was examined with fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The volunteer subjects were given 5 g of sodium benzoate orally and the two patients with urea cycle disorders (carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency type I and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) were already undergoing treatment with sodium benzoate and L-carnitine. The amount of benzoylcarnitine excretion depended on the dose of both sodium benzoate and L-carnitine in a reciprocal relation. Increased excretions of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine were also noted after sodium benzoate administration. The alteration of the urinary aclycarnitine profile was consistent with the change of mitochondrial CoA profile predicted by in vitro studies of an animal model. It is suggested that urinary acylcarnitine analysis is important to assess the effect of benzoate administration on mitochondrial function in vivo. Supplementation with carnitine may be necessary to minimise the adverse effects of sodium benzoate treatment in hyperammonaemia. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal trauma. A retrospective series of 118 magnetic resonance examinations of 110 patients who had sustained previous spinal trauma is reported. Examinations performed within 3 weeks of trauma showed extraspinal soft tissue (including ligamentous) injury in 48% and intraspinal lesions in 61% (mostly consisting of extradural haematoma and spinal cord contusion). In examinations performed more than 3 weeks after injury intraspinal abnormalities were shown in 51% and these represented spinal cord compression, atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia. Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique capability of displaying non-invasively the late sequelae of spinal trauma permitting simultaneous evaluation of the extra-spinal soft tissues, vertebral column and spinal cord. It is therefore recommended as the technique of choice in the investigation of patients who have sustained previous spinal injury, particularly those with neurological deficit. In the acute phase potentially remediable causes of neurological impairment such as disc herniation or extradural haematoma can be identified. Signal changes in the cord may allow the prognosis for neurological recovery to be established. In the later stages sequelae such as cord atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia are accurately identified and surgical therapy may be guided, where appropriate. 
Altered density of glomerular binding sites for atrial natriuretic factor in bile duct-ligated rats with ascites. The renal response to atrial natriuretic factor is blunted in cirrhosis with ascites. This might be due to alterations of renal receptors for atrial natriuretic factor. Therefore density and affinity of glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites of bile duct-ligated rats with ascites (n = 10) and of sham-operated controls (n = 10) were determined. Glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites were identified to be of the B-("biologically active") and C-("clearance") receptor type. Discrimination and quantitative determination of B and C receptors for atrial natriuretic factor were achieved by displacement experiments with atrial natriuretic factor(99-126) or des(18-22)atrial natriuretic factor(4-23), an analogue binding to C receptors only. Density of total glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites was significantly increased in bile duct-ligated rats (3,518 +/- 864 vs. 1,648 +/- 358 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05). This was due to a significant increase of C-receptor density (3,460 +/- 866 vs. 1,486 +/- 363 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05), whereas density of B receptors was not significantly different in bile duct-ligated rats (58 +/- 11 vs. 162 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein). Affinity of atrial natriuretic factor to its glomerular binding sites did not differ significantly between both groups. These data suggest that an altered glomerular atrial natriuretic factor receptor density could be involved in the renal resistance to atrial natriuretic factor in cirrhosis with ascites. 
The change in patterns of relapse in medulloblastoma. The authors reviewed 89 patients treated for cerebellar medulloblastoma between 1970 and 1989 to determine the impact of changing treatment (high-dose posterior fossa radiation therapy and chemotherapy) on the pattern of failure in medulloblastoma. Between 1970 and 1983, 50 patients (median follow-up, 110 months) were treated with surgery and postoperative craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Nineteen of the 50 (38%) recurred in the central nervous system (CNS). Isolated systemic (bone) metastases occurred in six. The median time to the development of bone metastases was 12 months. Since 1984, 39 patients (median follow-up, 27 months) were treated with preradiation chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vincristine for 9 weeks before initiation of CSI. Nine of the 39 (23%) patients recurred in the CNS. There were no systemic failures in this cohort. The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 55 +/- 7% for the earlier cohort and 72 +/- 8% for the later cohort (P equals 0.3). Posterior fossa recurrence was associated with radiation therapy to this area. The cumulative incidence of posterior fossa relapse was 50 +/- 13% in patients who received less than 5300 cGy and 18 +/- 7% in those who received 5300 cGy or more (P equals 0.005). All six bone relapses were in patients treated with CSI alone and 5300 cGy or more to the posterior fossa for a 5-year cumulative incidence of bone metastases of 18 +/- 7% compared with 0% for patients treated with 5300 cGy or more and chemotherapy (P equals 0.03). The authors concluded that high-dose radiation therapy has altered the pattern of relapse with an increase in systemic recurrence after radiation therapy alone that is now equivalent to the risk of recurrence in the posterior fossa. Chemotherapy may be indicated in an attempt to decrease this high risk of systemic metastases. 
Long-term follow-up after prosthetic replacement of the superior vena cava combined with resection of mediastinal-pulmonary malignant tumors. The contraindication to curative excision of mediastinal and pulmonary cancers because of invasion of the superior vena cava is now challenged by the existence of vascular prostheses that are suitable for venous replacement. Between 1979 and 1990 22 patients underwent resection of lung cancer (n = 6) or malignant mediastinal tumors (n = 16) involving the superior vena cava. Resection was done with concomitant venous reconstruction, and polytetrafluorethylene grafts were used. All bronchogenic carcinomas necessitated right pneumonectomy, whereas the excision of mediastinal tumors had to include pulmonary resections in nine patients (five lobectomies and four sublobar resections) and the right phrenic nerve in 12 patients. Venous reconstruction was performed by interposition of a large polytetrafluoroethylene graft between the proximal and cardiac ends of the superior vena cava (n = 8), or between one (n = 10) or both brachiocephalic veins (n = 4) and the right atrium. One patient died postoperatively (4.5%), and another had mediastinitis that was successfully treated by omentopexy. Chemotherapy was administered preoperatively to five patients and postoperatively to seven patients; radiotherapy was administered to two and 10 patients, respectively. The overall actuarial survival rate is 48% at 5 years, with 11 patients presently alive. The survival rate of patients with mediastinal tumors is 60% at 5 years. Among the patients with lung cancer, two with N1 disease are alive at 16 and 51 months, and one died at 38 months; the two patients with N2 disease died at 6 and 8 months. Only one graft occlusion occurred in the postoperative period; another occurred 14 months after operation and was precipitated by insertion of a central venous catheter. The patency of all remaining grafts was demonstrated after an average time of 23 (1 to 98) months. On the basis of these results, polytetrafluoroethylene graft replacement of the superior vena cava should be part of the planning and execution of radical excision with curative intent of mediastinal and right pulmonary malignant tumors that are not present with other contraindications, such as pleural or distant metastasis and severe systemic disease. 
Tolerance of gastric mucosal flap to postoperative irradiation. When malignant lesions of the oral cavity, base of tongue, and oropharynx are treated with radical resection, adequate reconstruction is required. The free gastric mucosal flap with microvascular transfer is being used with increasing frequency at Washington University Medical Center. Because of the advanced nature of the primary lesions, most patients also require postoperative radiation therapy. In this paper the tolerance of the gastric mucosal flap to postoperative radiation therapy is reviewed. The changes resulting from radiation therapy in the mucosal flap were found to be acceptable, and no major complications were encountered. 
Intravenous heme-albumin in acute intermittent porphyria: evidence for repletion of hepatic hemoproteins and regulatory heme pools. The purpose of this study was to assess effects of heme administered intravenously, complexed to human serum albumin, on activities of the hepatic hemoproteins, cytochrome(s) P-450, and tryptophan pyrrolase, and on the size of the heme pool that regulates activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase. Effects were compared in six normal women and four women with acute intermittent porphyria. All porphyric subjects over-excreted heme precursors and had histories of acute neurovisceral porphyric attacks. All subjects were placed on a constant daily diet that included at least 3 g carbohydrate/kg body weight and sufficient total intake to provide 1.4 times the estimated resting energy expenditure. Urinary excretions of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, porphyrins, and metabolites of tryptophan were measured daily before, during, and after infusions of heme-albumin. In the porphyric subjects, intravenous heme [4 mg (6.1 mumol)/kg body weight (BWt) with equimolar albumin], given daily for 4 days, markedly reduced overexcretion of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins, indicating repletion of the regulatory heme pool. The heme infusions also decreased mean urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from 4.9 to 2.9 mg/g creatinine per day, suggesting increased activity of hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase, the rate-controlling enzyme for metabolism of tryptophan to products not in the serotonin-5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid pathway. Heme-albumin infusions were without detectable effects on excretions of heme precursors or tryptophan metabolites in normal subjects. In contrast, in both normals and porphyrics, heme-albumin infusions significantly increased rates of antipyrine metabolism (by 159% and 330%, respectively), suggesting increased activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 were produced by the infusions. The infusions were well tolerated; no subject developed thrombophlebitis or bleeding. We conclude that such infusions are safe and effective in repleting deficient heme pools and hemoproteins in patients with acute porphyria, and that activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 in normal subjects may also be increased by heme administration. The therapeutic effect of heme in acute porphyria probably relates to its ability to decrease overproduction of precursors of heme or serotonin, as the result of its increasing critical cellular heme pools. 
Anti-V region antibodies as "almost clonotypic" reagents for the study of cutaneous T cell lymphomas and leukemias. Despite recent advances in the understanding of normal T lymphocyte immunobiology, there has been little progress in characterizing the non-HTLV cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and leukemias (CTCL) Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The two major impediments to in vitro studies of these malignancies have been the contamination of CTCL cells with normal T cells and the inability to induce a vigorous proliferative response or establish long-term cultures with standard T-cell mitogens. The ideal reagent for identifying CTCL cells in a given patient would be tumor specific. Although a monoclonal antibody to the clonotypic antigen receptor on CTCL cells would approach this ideal, it is not currently feasible to generate such antibodies for each CTCL patient. As a compromise, we chose to test an "almost clonotypic" reagent by examining whether monoclonal antibodies directed at the variable (V) region of the T-cell antigen receptor could be applied to CTCL. We identified three Sezary patients, who by standard T-cell phenotype and Southern blot analysis for clonality had a virtually pure peripheral blood population of leukemic cells (PBL). We then screened the PBL of these patients with a panel of seven commercially available monoclonal anti-V region antibodies and found one patients' cells reacted greater than 99% with alpha V beta 5. The other patients' cells were non-reactive. In addition, we utilized a solid-phase system to cross-link V beta 5 on the one CTCL patients' PBL cells, and found that they proliferated vigorously in the presence of 10 units of IL-2 and IL-4. Parallel cultures have been maintained for one month by restimulation twice a week. These findings suggest that anti-V region antibodies should prove useful for investigating the immunobiology of CTCL. 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the therapeutic use of recombinant human erythropoietin for anemia associated with chronic renal failure in predialysis patients. The US Recombinant Human Erythropoietin Predialysis Study Group [published erratum appears in Am J Kidney Dis 1991 Sep;18(3):420] One hundred seventeen patients with anemia related to chronic renal failure not severe enough to require maintenance dialysis were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO; 50, 100, or 150 U/kg body weight) or placebo intravenously (IV) three times a week for 8 weeks or until their anemia was corrected. Correction of anemia (hematocrit of 40% for males, 35% for females) occurred in 87% of those given 150 U/kg, 64% of those given 100 U/kg, 46% of those given 50 U/kg rHuEPO and in 3% of the placebo group. Energy levels and work capacity improved significantly in the group with corrected anemia compared with the group with uncorrected anemia. rHuEPO appeared to be well tolerated. There was no evidence that rHuEPO therapy accelerated the deterioration of renal function as measured by serum creatinine and reciprocal of serum creatinine compared with placebo treatment. However, it is essential that blood pressure and hematocrit be carefully monitored, particularly in hypertensive patients, to prevent the development of complications associated with hypertension. 
Preeclampsia as the great impostor. In contrast with a generation ago when preeclampsia was misdiagnosed as medical or surgical disease unrelated to pregnancy, today's diagnostic errors are those that consider surgical and medical problems as either pregnancy-induced hypertension or as the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Eleven case histories are presented of significant medical or surgical problems that were initially diagnosed as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome or pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incorrect diagnosis of medical-surgical cases during pregnancy often meant that appropriate therapy was delayed and that the rate of iatrogenic prematurity was increased. 
IgA nephropathy in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Renal glomerular changes are a well recognised complication of cirrhosis and are frequently characterised by mesangial IgA deposition. We report a patient with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension who developed IgA nephropathy and a nephrotic syndrome with renal histological changes classically associated with cirrhosis. Splenectomy with resection of a splenic artery aneurysm resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome. This case illustrates the factors which contribute to the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy in liver disease. 
Folk terminology for diarrhea in rural Bangladesh. Diarrhea, a descriptive term used in medical science for a variety of clinical diseases, denotes an illness that is categorized differently and known by numerous terms in various cultures. These diversified classifications and terminologies are based on the symptoms of diarrheal disorders, their perceived etiology, and their treatment. In Bangladesh, four types of illnesses with names derived from folk terminology have been identified for which the clinical symptoms resemble those of diarrhea. These include dud haga, which is due to ingestion of breast milk by infants; ajirno, which is due to overeating; amasha, a mucoid diarrhea; and daeria, which is severe watery diarrhea or cholera. Use of the word diarrhea in epidemiologic evaluations was discovered to be problematic; people confused this term with daeria, which accounted for only 5% of all episodes of diarrhea. The implications of such epidemiologic information for a large-scale program of oral rehydration therapy are also discussed. 
31P localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy of head and neck tumors--preliminary findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for accurate assessment of the anatomic extent of head and neck neoplasms. The development of methods for spatial localization by use of multiply tuned radio frequency coils that permit the measurement of multiple nuclear MR spectra (1H and 31P) from precisely defined volumes of interest has provided a basis for integrating spectroscopy into the clinical MRI examination. This offers a means for noninvasive monitoring of relative concentrations of mobile metabolites within a tumor. With the use of imaging to determine proper coil placement, a test-retest variance of about 17% is seen on MR spectroscopy. Data are presented from MRI/MRS studies for four head and neck lesions: (1) a squamous cell carcinoma of the lip; (2) a juvenile angiofibroma extending into the nasal cavity; (3) a massive chondrosarcoma of the nasal septum; and (4) a cervical nodal metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx. Spectra are evaluated by comparison of relative concentrations of phosphorus compounds. The concentrations of phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters are significantly higher in the neoplasms studied than in normal skeletal muscle. The developing role of integrated MRI/MRS to monitor the response of malignant neoplasm to radiation therapy is discussed. 
Metabolic responses to swimming exercise in Streptococcus pneumoniae infected rats. The present study was performed to determine whether alterations in fuel reserves or energy substrate utilization might explain the performance decrements that occur in bacterial infections. Male Fisher-Dunning rats were studied at 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Rats were either sedentary or subjected to a 2-h swimming session at these three time points (N = 10 in each group). A more than 60% reduction (P less than 0.01) in performance capacity was observed on day 3 of infection compared with that in noninfected controls. This infection in the rat is characterized by fever (P less than 0.01), depression of plasma zinc (P less than 0.01) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels (P less than 0.01), inhibition of the two- to threefold increase in fasting ketonemia, and a decreased (NS) insulin:glucagon ratio, indicating a catabolic state. Glycogen stores were reduced in the heart (47%), liver (43%), and skeletal muscles (39%) but not in the carcass. Superimposed exercise resulted in a further reduction but not depletion of liver, muscle, and carcass glycogen stores, a less pronounced lactic acid accumulation, and a lower oxygen debt. However, plasma FFA and ketone body levels were still maintained or even elevated, suggesting that fat is supplied as fuel during swimming exercise in this infection. Thus, results indicate that unavailability of energy substrates or lactacidosis is not limiting for performance capacity during this severe infection. 
Congestive heart failure. New frontiers. Congestive heart failure is a common syndrome with high mortality in its advanced stages. Current therapy includes the use of vasodilator drugs, which have been shown to prolong life. Despite current therapy, mortality remains high in patients with severe heart failure. Potent new inotropic vasodilators have improved ventricular performance but have not prolonged life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Serious arrhythmias are implicated in the sudden deaths of 30% to 40% of patients with severe heart failure, but the benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy have not been established. Upcoming trials will address this question. Ventricular remodeling and progressive dilatation after myocardial infarction commonly lead to congestive heart failure; early unloading of the ventricle with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may attenuate these events. These findings support the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome. 
Management of severe fibrocystic disease of the breast with leuprolide acetate. Symptoms of severe fibrocystic disease of the breast were successfully ameliorated in two patients as a result of treatment with daily subcutaneous LA without adverse effects. A state of drug-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism appears to be responsible for the clinical effect and is further suggestive of the hormonal dependence of this common disorder. 
Safety of surgical procedures performed by residents. The outcome of surgical procedures on the gallbladder performed by surgical residents in a university hospital was compared with the outcome of those performed by the attending staff. More than 60% of the operations (643/1084) were done by residents under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon. We found no differences in the rate of technical complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality, or length of hospitalization between the two groups. Thus, resident surgery under appropriate guidance is safe and does not compromise the quality of patient care or operative outcome. 
Chickenpox pneumonia, its complications and management. A report of three cases, including the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We report three cases of chickenpox pneumonia in adults, all of whom required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. One patient developed a variety of complications, and another, a pregnant woman, required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
Acetylcholine regulates pancreastatin secretion from the human pancreastatin-producing cell line (QGP-1N). Studies were made of pancreastatin (PST) secretion from a human PST-producing cell line (QGP-1N) in response to various secretagogues. Cells with immunoreactivity for PST were observed in monolayer cultures of QGP-1N cells. Carbachol stimulated PST secretion and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization concentration dependently in the range of 10(-6)-10(-4) M. The PST secretion and Ca2+ mobilization induced by carbachol were inhibited by atropine. The calcium ionophore (A23187) stimulated PST secretion. However, cholecystokinin and gastrin-releasing peptide did not stimulate either PST secretion or Ca2+ mobilization. Secretin also did not stimulate PST secretion. The glucose concentration in the culture medium had no effect on PST secretion. These results suggest that PST secretion is mainly regulated by acetylcholine through a muscarinic receptor, and that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in stimulus-secretion coupling in QGP-1N cells. 
Delayed visual loss due to trauma of the internal carotid artery. The group of six patients in this study experienced delayed visual loss following head trauma. Visual loss occurred from 1 day to 13 years after the initial injury. All patients suffered indirect trauma to the internal carotid artery resulting in formation of either an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Review of the radiologic and clinical findings was performed in six patients. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. All patients had follow-up clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Treatment by neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiologic procedures resulted in significant visual improvement in five patients. Different pathophysiologic mechanisms could be correlated with the delayed visual loss produced by the two types of lesions. The pathologic changes associated with the aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms included direct compression of optic nerves and/or chiasm and intracranial hematoma. A carotid-cavernous fistula caused delayed visual loss by either hematoma at the orbital apex or compression of the chiasm and/or optic nerves by saccular dilatation of the cavernous sinus. The delayed onset of decreased vision following head trauma should alert the physician to the possibility of a traumatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Different neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms can usually be correlated with the pathologic changes demonstrated by neuroimaging procedures. 
Clinical and angiographic observations on resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death. The clinical and angiographic findings of 17 resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death are reported in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of these deaths. Ten survivors developed cardiac arrest during or after sporting activities (group A) and 7 others during or after an exercise stress test (group B). There were 15 men and 2 women. The mean age of group A was 46 years and of group B 55 years. Coronary risk factors, as well as previous angina and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in group B. Only 3 of the 17 survivors had anginal symptoms before sudden death. Sudden death in group A was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 8 and unstable angina in 2 and was associated in group B with acute myocardial infarction in 2, unstable angina in 3 and silent ischemia in 2. Coronary angiography was acutely performed in 15 patients. In most patients the ischemia-related coronary artery was totally or subtotally occluded. Clinical and angiographic findings indicate that exercise-related sudden ischemic death was due to an acute coronary event--in most cases unexpected and unpredictable. It is suggested that exercise-induced intracoronary changes were probably responsible for the development of acute coronary (sub)occlusion and sudden death. 
Establishment from Shope carcinoma induced in an inbred rabbit of culture cell lines with various potentials for differentiation and tumorigenicity. Shope papillomas induced by cottontail rabbit papilloma-virus (CRPV) in domestic rabbits frequently regress spontaneously or, failing to do so, convert into squamous cell carcinomas at a high rate. This papilloma-carcinoma complex in rabbits provides an experimental model for human papillo-mavirus-associated malignancies. The aim of this study was to prepare an experimental system in inbred rabbits by establishing culture cell lines of the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma developed from a Shope papilloma that had been induced 6 months previously by inoculating CRPV into an inbred B/J rabbit. By in vitro culturing of the tumor cells, cell lines with potentials for terminal differentiation and tumorigenicity were established. Cloning yielded sublines that varied in these potentials and possessed episomal and integrated CRPV genomes as revealed by Southern hybridization in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Major CRPV-specific transcripts were similarly observed both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated sublines. Immunofluorescence with syngeneic rabbit antibody against tumor-specific antigens localized such antigens mainly in the nuclei of the cells of these sublines. This experimental system allows experiments that were not feasible in randomly bred rabbits. 
Access to neurological care for minorities. Minority groups comprise a major segment of the estimated more than 34 million Americans without insurance coverage and also the underinsured. Neurologic disease and neurologic complications of the major causes of morbidity and mortality affect minorities protracted by limited access to health care. Hypertension, a major cause of stroke in the black population, is just one example of the impact of accessibility to intervention in central nervous system disease. Health statistics note the persisting gap between minority groups and the nation's norms for life expectancy. Aging America and particularly black elderly women, combined with the lagging infant mortality among minority groups, demonstrate limited access issues beyond economics, reflecting inner city mores, cultural barriers, and communication delay limiting contact with the practicing neurologist. Awareness of such access limitations to neurological care for minorities demands the attention of the practicing neurologist and the neurological societies. 
Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum. Documentation of a late onset type of the juvenile onset form. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive, neurocutaneous disorder characterized by sunlight-induced skin cancers and defective DNA repair. Many XP children develop a primary neuronal degeneration. We describe 2 unusual XP patients who had a delayed onset of XP neurological disease. Somatic cell genetic studies indicated that they have the same defective DNA repair gene and are both in XP complementation group A. These 2 patients, together with a group A patient previously reported from London, establish as a distinct clinical entity the late onset type of the juvenile onset form of XP neurological disease. The functional capacity of these patients' cultured fibroblast strains to survive after treatment with ultraviolet radiation indicates that their DNA repair defect is less severe than that of typical group A patients who have a more severe neurodegeneration with an earlier symptomatic onset. The premature death of nerve cells in XP patients (which is presumably due to their inherited defects in DNA repair mechanisms) suggests that normal repair of damaged DNA in neurons is required to maintain integrity of the human nervous system. 
Brain stem atrophy in Joseph disease: a morphometric study using two-dimensional (area) measurement by computed tomography. Eight Japanese patients with Joseph disease were studied using computed tomography (CT). Morphometric analysis using the two-dimensional (area) measurement by CT was performed in the infratentorial region. The brain-stem index, an index of brain-stem atrophy or pontine atrophy, revealed a significant decrease (P less than 0.01), with a mean of 66.7% when compared with 16 control subjects. The patients showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01), with a mean of three times that of the controls in the fourth ventricular index, an index of fourth ventricular dilatation. There were no differences in the cerebellar index, an index of cerebellar atrophy, between these patients and the controls, although the patients had an increased number of visible cerebellar vermian (2.0, SD 0.7) and hemispheric sulci (2.6 SD 0.6) as compared with the controls (vermian sulci: 0.4, SD 0.7: hemispheric sulci: 0). These data indicate severe pontine atrophy, fourth ventricular dilatation with mild involvement of the cerebellum and correlate well with the common pathological features of Joseph disease. The present morphometric evaluation by CT may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of Joseph disease. 
The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in women undergoing laparoscopy is influenced by the day of menstrual cycle. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a major cause of postoperative morbidity. It can lead to increased recovery time, delaying patient discharge and an increase in hospital costs. Past studies have shown that postoperative nausea and vomiting is more frequent in women than men, appears to elevate around the time of menarche and is reduced around the time of menopause. This retrospective review of a one-year experience of laparoscopic tubal ligation at our institute examined the effect of menstrual cycle on postoperative nausea and vomiting. The anaesthetic and surgical techniques were consistent for all patients. Patient data included age, weight, last day of menstrual cycle, the length of anaesthetic, the dose of inhalational agent, the dose of narcotic, emesis on emergence and whether or not droperidol was used. Of the the 235 patients in the study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 28%. One hundred fifty-eight had had no preoperative antiemetic and 77 had received droperidol. These two groups were analyzed separately. The incidence in the group not receiving droperidol was 33.5% and in the droperidol group, 16.9% (P less than 0.01). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on the first eight menstrual days (51.6 vs 21.6, P less than 0.001), was highest on day five of the menstrual cycle and lowest on days 18, 19, and 20 where there was no nausea and vomiting. Droperidol reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting but the variation in postoperative nausea and vomiting during the cycle persisted. 
Bio-medicus ventricular assist device for salvage of cardiac surgical patients Over a 5-year period, 41 (1%) of 4,193 patients undergoing cardiac operations underwent intraoperative or early postoperative insertion of a Bio-Medicus ventricular assist device when it became apparent that the patient could not otherwise survive. Fourteen patients were in cardiogenic shock and 7 were in cardiac arrest at the time of initiation of their primary cardiac surgical procedure, and in no instance was the device planned as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Bleeding, sepsis, and thromboembolism were frequent postoperative complications. Central nervous system deficits were observed in 16 patients during their postoperative course. Eight patients (19.5%) were long-term survivors. Of the preoperative risk factors evaluated only age was significantly associated with survival, with 7 (33%) of the 21 younger (39 to 63 years) patients surviving. Blood product usage and hospital cost were analyzed in an attempt to assess cost/effectiveness of use of this device for attempted salvage of such desperately ill patients. 
The applications of PET in clinical oncology. With the advent of a new generation of PET scanners that have introduced whole-body PET to the clinical setting, there is now more interest in developing protocols for the evaluation of both intracranial and somatic cancers. The value of PET in clinical oncology has been demonstrated with studies in a variety of cancers including colorectal carcinomas, lung tumors, head and neck tumors, primary and metastatic brain tumors, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma, bone cancers, and other soft-tissue cancers. A summary of current clinical applications of PET in oncology is presented with special attention to colorectal, lung, and intracranial neoplasms since the majority of clinical trials have focused on these cancers. A variety of radiopharmaceuticals are described that are currently included in clinical tumor-imaging protocols, including metabolic substrates such as fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine, and analogs of chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorine-18-fluorouracil and fluoroestradiol. An attempt is also made to include examples of clinical trials that demonstrate response to therapeutic intervention. The increasing number of oncologic PET studies reflects the growing interest in functional imaging in oncology. 
Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in systemic sclerosis and response to nifedipine and captopril. PURPOSE: This prospective study was performed to evaluate the response of the cardiopulmonary vasculature to two vasodilators in patients with systemic sclerosis and either minimal or no central hemodynamic abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon (19 of 20 patients), and clinically normal cardiac function underwent right heart catheterization. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output by thermodilution, were performed before and after oral administration of nifedipine 20 mg and captopril 25 mg. RESULTS: Half of the patients had normal hemodynamics (Group A); the other half (Group B) had abnormal baseline elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and four of them showed "borderline" pulmonary arterial hypertension. Group A, with significantly shorter disease duration compared with Group B, responded poorly to nifedipine and captopril. However, Group B had significant decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance (from 148 +/- 20 to normal levels of 94 +/- 21 dynes.second.cm-5) and pulmonary mean pressure in response to nifedipine treatment but not to captopril. CONCLUSION: These observations show a short-term beneficial effect of nifedipine in the cardiopulmonary vasculature of patients with systemic sclerosis and suggest that a potentially reversible vasoconstrictive element is included in the vascular lesion of this disorder. 
Suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by oral administration of myelin antigens: IV. Suppression of chronic relapsing disease in the Lewis rat and strain 13 guinea pig. Oral administration of proteins is a long-recognized method of inducing antigen-specific peripheral immune tolerance. We previously showed that oral administration of myelin basic protein suppresses monophasic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat when it is given in association with immunization and prior to disease onset. As a potential therapy for human autoimmune disease, it is crucial to determine whether oral tolerance can ameliorate an ongoing immune response. We therefore asked whether oral administration of myelin antigens, after sensitization and disease expression has occurred, could affect immunological, clinical, or pathological features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in the Lewis rat and strain 13 guinea pig by immunization with whole guinea pig cord homogenate, complete Freund's adjuvant, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Following recovery from the first attack, animals were orally given bovine myelin, guinea pig myelin, or guinea pig myelin basic protein three times per week for up to 3 months. Animals receiving myelin products orally had decreased severity and frequency of clinical relapses, decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to myelin antigens, diminished inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), and decreased areas of CNS demyelination. In the rat, guinea pig myelin basic protein was as effective as guinea pig myelin in ameliorating the disease and also resulted in decreased serum anti-myelin basic protein antibody levels. No exacerbation of disease or worsening of pathological findings occurred in the animals given myelin products. These results demonstrate that oral administration of myelin antigens can suppress chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and have direct relevance to therapy of human demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. 
Intrahepatic spontaneous arterioportal fistula: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and angiographic treatment. A 54-yr-old male with portal hypertension received ineffective medical therapy for the diagnosis of portal hepatic cirrhosis. Duplex ultrasound (US) revealed pulsatile arterial flow in the right main portal vein. The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic arterioportal fistula was established and confirmed by angiography. Right hepatic artery embolization with three coils was performed. The patient is alive for 16 months after the embolization, and his complaints have disappeared. There has been full resorption of ascites and absence of varices. Nine previously reported similar cases are reviewed.
