Severe congestive heart failure. How successful are drug and transplant therapies? Severe congestive heart failure is a fatal illness. Aggressive use of proven medical regimens, including vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prolong survival time for some patients. Those with refractory symptoms and seriously reduced left ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for cardiac transplantation. Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year. Major problems include organ rejection, serious infection, development of coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, and the limited donor organ supply. 
Air in the temporomandibular joint fossa: CT sign of temporal bone fracture. Temporal bone fractures can be difficult to detect clinically and radiographically. Air is sometimes present in the glenoid fossa of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) at computed tomography (CT) of acute basilar skull fractures. This study evaluated TMJ fossa air as a sign of temporal bone fracture. Initial CT scans of the head in 114 patients with a diagnosis of basilar skull fracture at discharge were retrospectively reviewed. TMJ fossa air was present in 23 of 114 patients (20.2%) and was bilateral in three patients. Only temporal bone fractures were significantly (P less than .001) associated with TMJ fossa air. Temporal bone fractures were observed at CT in 23 of 26 cases of TMJ fossa air, but in three of 26 cases, TMJ fossa air was the only CT sign of clinically apparent temporal bone fractures. TMJ fossa air is associated with acute temporal bone fracture and may be the only CT sign of an otherwise inconspicuous temporal bone fracture. 
Regulation of c-myc expression by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in human leukemia cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates both the proliferation and functional properties of normal and leukemic myeloid cells via cell surface receptors. The postreceptor mechanisms for these two actions, and the extent to which they represent overlapping biochemical pathways, have not been fully clarified. We have examined the actions of GM-CSF on the expression of c-myc, an early response oncogene associated with the proliferative stimulus of growth factors. GM-CSF reduced the population doubling time of HL-60 leukemia cells from 32 hours to 25 hours, and, at concentrations that were correlated with mitogenicity, induced a rapid twofold increase in the level of c-myc mRNA. Nuclear runoff studies indicated that GM-CSF approximately doubled the transcription rate of c-myc by reversing the transcription attenuation that occurs at the exon 1-intron 1 junction. GM-CSF had no effect on the half-life of c-myc messenger RNA. The biochemical basis for the modulation of c-myc expression by GM-CSF was explored. GM-CSF treatment caused intracellular alkalinization of the cells as measured using the fluorescent probe 2', 7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The sodium channel blocker amiloride prevented the GM-CSF-induced change in pH, but did not affect the stimulation of c-myc transcription by GM-CSF. Agents that increase cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (prostaglandin E2 and cholera toxin) blocked the actions of GM-CSF on c-myc; however, these agents also reduced the basal level of c-myc expression. GM-CSF caused a rapid (5 minutes) and transient decline in cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, and a slower (30 minutes) and transient decrease in cellular cAMP levels. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the declines in cAMP and cGMP are associated with a stimulation of HL-60 proliferation, while previously reported manipulations that elevate cyclic nucleotides are related to an inhibition of HL-60 proliferation and the potentiation of differentiation. 
Normalization of left ventricular mass and associated changes in neurohormones and atrial natriuretic peptide after 1 year of sustained nifedipine therapy for severe hypertension. Sixteen patients with severe hypertension were treated for 1 year with extended release nifedipine, during which time serial changes in left ventricular mass index and associated alterations in left ventricular systolic function, left ventricular filling, plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide and catecholamines were evaluated. Mean seated blood pressure (+/- SE) was significantly reduced from 200 +/- 8/122 +/- 3 to 144 +/- 5/89 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) at 1 year. After 6 months, left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced by 19% from 121 +/- 8 to 96 +/- 7 g/m2 and this reduction was sustained at 1 year. Septal and posterior wall thickness were reduced from 13.4 +/- 0.1 to 11.2 +/- 0.04 mm and from 12.8 +/- 0.1 to 10.0 +/- 0.03 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 63% to 25%. Left ventricular fractional shortening increased from 34 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05) and the relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress did not change. Over the year of sustained blood pressure reduction, the peak velocity of early filling increased from 57 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 4 cm/s (p = 0.07), peak velocity of late filling did not change and the ratio of late to early peak left ventricular filling velocity significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, markedly elevated at entry, decreased from 70 +/- 15 to 41 +/- 8 pg/ml at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were not altered. 
Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
Cardiac function after hepatic ischemia-anoxia and reperfusion injury: a new experimental model. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During liver transplantation, reperfusion of the donor liver and in the clinical setting, end-stage liver disease, have occasionally resulted in profound cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of hepatic injury-induced myocardial dysfunction is still unclear. In this study, the aims were to develop an experimental model that would facilitate the study of the effects of hepatic failure on myocardial function and to determine whether hepatic ischemia or anoxia and reperfusion injury of similar duration would result in the same degree of hepatic failure. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as organ donors. Three simultaneous liver-heart perfusions (corresponding to three groups) were established using a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 2% bovine albumin, membrane oxygenation, and a peristaltic pump. Group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 15) experiments consisted of liver-heart perfusions after 90 mins of normothermic hepatic ischemia or 90 mins of hepatic anoxia, respectively, followed by reoxygenation and 60 mins of reperfusion. Group 3 (n = 8) experiments consisted of sham liver-heart perfusions studied over the same experimental time period (60 mins). Myocardial function variables, liver function tests, arterial blood gases, and electrolytes were measured at baseline and at 3-, 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals during reperfusion in all experiments. RESULTS: Ischemia or anoxia-induced hepatic failure resulted in a similar degree of hepatic dysfunction. Both forms of acute hepatic failure caused significant increases in liver function tests, a reduction in heart rate (p less than .05), coronary flow (p less than .05), and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (p less than .05). There were no changes in buffer pH, CO2, or ionized calcium that could explain the coronary vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic dysfunction induced by ischemia or anoxia of similar duration results in a similar hepatic metabolic profile during reperfusion and can cause direct myocardial dysfunction of the isolated perfused rat heart. 
Surgically treated cavernous angiomas of the brain stem: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of surgically treated brain stem cavernous angiomas are presented. The previously reported cases are reviewed and the clinical features, radiographic appearance, and treatment of this condition are discussed. Symptomatic brain stem cavernous angiomas should be treated surgically and can be removed with good outcomes. 
Colchicine and antineoplastic therapy for the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions. The complexity of the events that culminate in intimal proliferation after arterial injury and similarities between this response and benign neoplasia suggest that conventional medical therapies will continue to be unsuccessful in preventing recurrent stenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization. By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology. 
Symptomatic retinoschisis-detachment involving the macula. We treated three patients (four eyes) in whom posteriorly situated retinoschisis-detachments became symptomatic because of elevation of a limited area of full-thickness retina at the macula adjacent to these lesions. Laser photocoagulation alone was successful in achieving long-term macular reattachment in one eye but failed in both eyes of a bilaterally affected patient. In this patient, retinal cryopexy, external drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and intravitreal air injection attained long-term macular reattachment and retinoschisis cavity collapse in both eyes. In the third patient, cryopexy, drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and scleral buckling failed to reattach the retina. Subsequent laser photocoagulation induced reabsorption of subretinal fluid but without retinoschisis cavity collapse. Alternative management strategies for these unusual cases include retinal cryopexy alone and vitrectomy techniques. 
Self-inflicted eye injuries. Five cases of self-inflicted eye injury are described and discussed. A review of the literature shows that several psychiatric diagnoses have been assigned to people who damage their eyes. A variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are described. 
Skin pretreatment and the use of transdermal clonidine. Although therapy with transdermal clonidine is effective in bringing elevated blood pressure under control, this mode of delivery has been associated with localized dermal reactions in a small percentage of patients. Because anecdotal information suggests that a number of physicians have resorted to various dermal pretreatment strategies in an effort to alleviate or eliminate these dermal reactions, we decided to investigate the two most commonly used pretreatment strategies, to determine if they affected the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of transdermally administered clonidine. Specifically, we examined the effect of dermal pretreatment with 0.5% hydrocortisone cream and with an over-the-counter antacid, magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension, on the pharmacokinetics of transdermal clonidine in 10 adult hypertensive males. Patients were randomized to receive one of the two pretreatment regimens or therapy with the patch alone, and after 7 days of treatment and a 14-day washout period, patients were crossed over to receive one of the other therapies. All patients ultimately received all three therapies. We present here the results from the 10 patients enrolled in our study. Our study found a statistical difference detected in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), steady-state plasma concentration (Css), and apparent clonidine dose delivered (Doseapp) following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with the transdermal patch alone. The mean +/- SD relative extents of absorption (Frel) of clonidine following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone and magnesium-aluminum hydroxide in respect to the transdermal patch alone were 94.84 +/- 45.69% and 97.65 +/- 59.65%, respectively. No significant difference was detected in this parameter. Supine and sitting blood pressures and pulse rates were similar during treatment with clonidine alone, following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone cream, and following pretreatment with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension. In addition, systemic side effects were evenly distributed among treatments. However, dermal side effects were less frequent following pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide and the patch alone. The results of this study suggest that dermal pretreatment with 0.5 percent hydrocortisone cream may significantly alter the plasma concentrations of transdermally administered clonidine without adversely altering the pharmacodynamics. 
Use of the optical urethrotome knife in the treatment of a benign low rectal anastomotic stricture. Several methods of treatment for benign anastomotic strictures following anterior resection have been described. Surgical intervention in terms of re-exploration and excision of the stricture or the formation of a permanent colostomy will be accompanied by substantial morbidity. The dilatation of these strictures without direct vision may not be safe. We describe a simple method of treating benign rectal anastomotic stricture using an optical urethrotome knife under direct vision. This technique affords an accurate incision of the stricture to increase the size of the lumen, thereby relieving obstruction. 
A balanced carbohydrate: protein diet in the management of Parkinson's disease. Although restricting dietary protein is a proposed adjunct to treating Parkinson's disease (PD), the effect of carbohydrate consumption is unknown. We measured plasma levodopa and large neutral amino acid (LNAA) levels in nine PD patients treated with carbidopa/levodopa and different isocaloric meals containing high protein-low carbohydrate, low protein-high carbohydrate, and balanced 5:1 carbohydrate:protein mixtures. We found that levodopa levels increased significantly regardless of the type of diet, but that plasma LNAA levels varied less and motor performance was superior after the balanced diet than after the other two meals. We conclude that PD patients can consume nutritionally adequate meals and still maintain a stable plasma levodopa:LNAA ratio. 
Prevention of an air embolism by moderate hypoventilation during surgery in the sitting position. The effect of ventilation (normo-, hypo-, and hyperventilation) on transverse sinus pressure (TSP), central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial blood pressure (mABP), and heart rate was studied in 15 patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment in the sitting position for tumors of the posterior fossa, and the findings were compared with the influence of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on these parameters. TSP was not influenced significantly by PEEP ranging from 0 to 15 mbar, whereas CVP increased. At the same time, mABP decreased slightly. In contrast, TSP showed characteristic changes with varying ventilation: during normoventilation [end expiratory CO2 pressure (PECO2), 38 mm Hg], TSP was 3 mm Hg and increased to 7 mm Hg on average with hypoventilation (PECO2, 44 mm Hg), whereas hyperventilation (PECO2, 32 mm Hg) caused a reduction in TSP to the atmospheric range. At the same time, CVP remained unchanged, whereas mABP increased with hypoventilation. Presuming that the risk of venous air embolism is closely related to the level of TSP, our results allow the following conclusions. 1) PEEP does not seem to be effective in preventing venous air embolism. 2) Hyperventilation is dangerous in the sitting position, as TSP is reduced to the atmospheric and even subatmospheric range. 3) To prevent air embolism, moderate hypoventilation is recommended during the most critical period of exposing the posterior fossa followed by normoventilation when surgery of the actual lesion has begun. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies in cerebral ischemia. In a 2-year prospective study of 146 patients with cerebral ischemia, we compared vascular risk factors for stroke with clinical and laboratory findings, particularly antiphospholipid antibodies. Ten patients (6.8%) were positive for at least one antiphospholipid antibody; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, one had rheumatoid arthritis, and the remaining eight fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These patients were predominantly male, not necessarily young, and 50% of them did not have any other vascular risk factors; there were no significant clinical or paraclinical differences between these patients and those without antiphospholipid antibodies. Outcome in the 10 patients was good, and platelet antiaggregating drugs proved to be useful in preventing further cerebrovascular ischemic events in our patients. 
Clinical significance of pericardial rub with regional ventricular dilatation. To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with regional ventricular dilatation in the early phase of myocardial infarction (MI), 228 patients with acute Q-wave anterior MI were studied. Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day. Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation. Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation. Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association. 
Long-time survival of a patient with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome. Case report. A rare case of Turcot's syndrome is reported in a long-time survivor of glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was treated for his tumor in 1976 with macroscopically complete surgical resection and radiotherapy consisting of 60 Gy to the tumor bed and 40 Gy to the whole brain. Five years later, in 1981, he developed adenocarcinoma of the colon Dukes Stage B which was successfully treated at another hospital by surgery alone. In 1990, he presented with multiple colon polyps and adenocarcinoma Dukes Stage A. For more than 15 years, the patient has been afflicted with cystic and conglobate acne. Possible mechanisms and treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid are discussed. 
Effects of isradipine on platelet function in hypertension at rest and during exercise. The effects of eight weeks of treatment with isradipine (1.25 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 2.5 mg twice daily for four weeks) on ex vivo platelet function were investigated in ten male patients with hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serum thromboxane B2, and beta-thromboglobulin levels were significantly decreased (P less than .05) at rest before exercise ergometry, during exercise, and at rest after exercise. The platelet count and plasma levels of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) were not affected by isradipine. It is concluded that treatment of hypertension with a compound that lowers blood pressure and inhibits platelet activation may be of clinical benefit when routinely applied in hypertensive patients. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide response to cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation and role of associated heart failure. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured before and 1 hour after cardioversion in 40 patients (27 with atrial flutter and 13 with atrial fibrillation) admitted for elective cardioversion. Fourteen (11 with atrial flutter and 3 with atrial fibrillation) had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversion to sinus rhythm was successful in 39 patients. The mean ANP concentration in the entire group decreased after cardioversion from 38 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 2 pmol/liter (p less than 0.001). In the subgroup with CHF, the ANP level, which was not significantly higher than that in the group without CHF, decreased from 47 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 3 pmol/liter (p less than 0.01). Neither mode of cardioversion (spontaneous 1, pharmacologic 2 and direct-current countershock 36) nor associated CHF influenced ANP response to cardioversion. One patient with atrial flutter and "failed cardioversion" had unchanged ANP level. The decrease after cardioversion in ANP concentration correlated with its control level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) but not with the decrease in heart rate. The ANP level in patients with atrial fibrillation was 45 +/- 9 vs 38 +/- 5 pmol/liter in those with atrial flutter (difference not significant). Arrhythmia duration, left atrial size, and ventricular rate or arterial blood pressure did not correlate with ANP concentration in any subgroup. It is concluded that (1) the ANP level is elevated comparably in patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation regardless of the presence or absence of CHF; and (2) the level decreases, independent of the mode of cardioversion or presence of CHF, promptly after successful cardioversion. 
Urinary retention--an unusual dystonic reaction to continuous metoclopramide infusion. Vomiting is one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy. Metoclopramide by continuous infusion (400 micrograms/kg/h after a loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg) is a novel administration method for optimizing efficacy. A two-year-old boy developed urinary retention on three occasions, once accompanied by priapism and slurred speech, while receiving a continuous infusion. This was reversed by procyclidine, suggesting that it may have been a dystonic reaction. 
Transforming growth factors beta 1 and alpha in chronic liver disease. Effects of interferon alfa therapy BACKGROUND. Cirrhosis is a diffuse process of hepatic fibrosis and regenerative nodule formation of unknown pathogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 induces the production of extracellular matrix proteins by liver cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in laboratory animals. TGF alpha is a hepatocyte mitogen that participates in liver regeneration. METHODS. Using Northern blot analysis, we studied the expression of TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in liver specimens from 42 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 12 subjects with either normal or fatty livers. The results were correlated with measurements of procollagen Type I mRNA in liver tissue, procollagen Type III peptide in serum, and the degree of histologic injury. We also investigated whether TGF alpha mRNA would be detectable in biopsy specimens of livers with proliferative activity. RESULTS. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression correlated closely with the expression of procollagen Type I mRNA (r = 0.94) and serum procollagen Type III peptide (r = 0.89) and with the histologic activity index (r = 0.73). All patients with increased fibrogenic activity (serum procollagen Type III peptide level, greater than 11.9 micrograms per liter) had increased levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA (2 to 14 times the levels in the control group or in patients with normal fibrogenic activity), and both TGF alpha and H3 histone (a marker of DNA synthesis) mRNAs were detectable in patients with regenerative nodules. Six of eight patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa for one year had sustained clinical responses with normalization of serum procollagen Type III peptide and aminotransferase activity. All these patients had normal levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA in liver specimens obtained at the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS. TGF beta 1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, and TGF alpha expression may be associated with liver regeneration in these patients. 
Immunohistochemical characterization, distribution, and ultrastructure of lymphocytes bearing T-cell receptor gamma/delta in inflammatory bowel disease. Phenotypic characterization and distribution of gamma/delta T lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa were investigated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease by immunohistochemistry. The ratio of delta(+) cells to CD3(+) cells in the intraepithelial space of colon was decreased in Crohn's disease (13%) and strikingly decreased in ulcerative colitis (8%) compared with the control (36%). Delta(+) cells in the lamina propria were also decreased, particularly in the distal ileum of Crohn's disease (4%), compared with the control (15%). On the contrary, the cells gathered at the severe inflammatory sites with other inflammatory cells, including beta(+) cells, and were densely distributed in the T-cell zone around lymphoid follicles. Phenotypic characterization showed that delta(+) lamina proprial lymphocytes of colon were mainly CD4(-)CD8(-) in the control (80%) and Crohn's disease (59%). However, in ulcerative colitis, CD4(-)CD8(-) delta(+) lymphocytes were rarely found (3%). This reflects the difference of immunologic background between the two diseases. Immunoelectron microscopically, these cells in inflammatory bowel disease were rich with vesicular structures in cytoplasms, whereas those in the control group contained electron-opaque granules. The decrease and the morphological change may be closely related to the weakness of mucosal defense. 
Haemodynamic considerations in the management of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebral vasospasm occurs, following subarachnoid haemorrhage, in the majority of patients and is accompanied by cerebral ischaemia in 30%. The objectives of this article are to review (1) the effects of subarachnoid haemorrhage and vasospasm on cerebral blood flow (CBF); (2) the effects of induced hypotension and hypocapnia on CBF in these patients; (3) current therapy for cerebral ischaemia from vasospasm. The medical literature was searched using Index Medicus; for the period 1983-90 this search was done on a computer with the CD-ROM version of Index Medicus, Silver Platter. Papers were selected on the basis of validity and applicability to clinical practice; animal studies are included when human data is lacking. Cerebral vasospasm may decrease cerebral blood flow, disturb autoregulation and place the patient at risk for delayed cerebral ischaemia. Intraoperative induced hypotension and hypocapnia can decrease CBF further, although effects of either on outcome have not been evaluated. Calcium antagonists are effective for both the prevention and the treatment of delayed cerebral ischaemia. Of the mechanical treatments, systemic-arterial hypertension has the firmest scientific foundation, although this is frequently combined with haemodilution and blood volume expansion. There is a need for randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of these latter treatments. 
Caffeine clearance by enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique: a simple, inexpensive, and useful indicator of liver function. The clinical value and sensitivity of serum caffeine clearance measurement has been evaluated as an indicator of hepatic disease. After a 17 hour caffeine exclusion period, 300 mg of caffeine citrate was administered orally to the study subjects. Serum samples were taken four and 16 hours later. Serum caffeine concentrations were measured using an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and a clearance value derived. Conventional liver function tests were measured at the same time. A total of 103 subjects attending the medical unit in a district general hospital were studied. Twenty one had alcoholic liver disease, 11 non-alcoholic cirrhosis, nine non-cirrhotic liver disease, 21 suspected liver disease, six hepatic tumours, and 35 were hospital and normal control subjects. Caffeine clearance values were lowest in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (median 0.19 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-0.61 ml/min/kg) and significantly reduced in all subjects with liver disease (median 0.32 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-2.68 ml/min/kg) compared with control subjects (median 1.27 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001). In subjects with suspected liver disease subsequently shown to have another explanation for abnormal liver function test results, caffeine clearance values were normal (median 1.31 ml/min/kg, range 0.23-2.64 ml/min/kg) and significantly different, p less than 0.001, from those of subjects with liver disease. Serum albumen values were not different for these latter two groups. Using a cut off value of 0.86 ml/min/kg, caffeine clearance measurement was 100% sensitive for alcoholic liver disease and 89% sensitive for all liver disease. The respective sensitivities for conventional liver function test measurement were 76% and 83%. In the suspected liver disease group, caffeine clearance was abnormal in only 24%, conventional liver function tests were abnormal in 95%. 
Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. A case of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung is described in a 19-year-old man who had had a lobectomy in infancy, for removal of a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. It is suggested that congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation may predispose a patient to development of epithelial malignancies of the lung, whereas mesenchymal hamartomas usually are associated with nonepithelial neoplasms. 
Expression of perforin in infiltrating cells in murine hearts with acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3. BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase. 
Macroscopic vasovasostomy re-examined. Results of 273 consecutive macroscopic vasovasostomy procedures performed at a single institution over a nine-year period between 1978 and 1987 were reviewed. When patients operated on less than five years after vasectomy were compared with those in whom more than five years had elapsed since vasectomy, significant declines in technical success rates as measured by return of sperm to the ejaculate (93% vs. 74%, p less than 0.004), biologic recovery as measured by mean sperm counts (55 million vs. 35 million) and mean progressive sperm motility (30% vs. 13%), and clinical success as measured by pregnancy rates (52% vs. 30%, p less than 0.02), were observed. Examination of complications of vasovasostomy showed a 7.7 percent overall complication rate and a 1.5 percent incidence of major complications. 
Radiologic evaluation of the normal and diseased posterior cervical space. The posterior cervical space seen on cross-sectional imaging of the neck constitutes most of the posterior triangle seen on clinical examination. Although triangular anatomy relates best to the surface perspective of the clinician, a spatial approach to anatomy works better for the radiologist viewing axial images. The posterior cervical space is defined as the area in the posterolateral portion of the neck from the skull base to the clavicles deep to the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles but superficial to the prevertebral space. Its principal contents are fat, the spinal accessory nerve, and lymph nodes. We analyzed CT and MR images and clinical records of 63 patients known or suspected to have disease of the posterior cervical space to determine the imaging features that mark a lesion as originating in the posterior cervical space and the spectrum of diseases that arise there. Of the 63 patients in the study, four had clinical pseudomasses, nine had congenital lesions, 10 had inflammatory disease, six had benign tumors, and 34 had malignant tumors. A typical mass lesion of the posterior cervical space was centered within the fat of the space, between the deep and superficial layers of the deep cervical fascia. Characteristic displacements caused by a mass in the posterior cervical space included anteromedial displacement of the carotid space and posteromedial displacement of the prevertebral space. Our study shows that the differential diagnosis of lesions of the posterior cervical space reflects the normal contents of the space, and that diagnosis can thereby be predicted from knowledge of the normal anatomy and contents of the space. 
Adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels in anoxia. Potassium channels that are activated by decreasing adenosine trisphosphate levels are blocked by sulfonylurea drugs such as glibenclamide but are opened by diazoxide and some endogenous peptides. Judging from the effects of such drugs, it seems that in the hippocampus, these channels are present not on cell bodies but rather on glutamate-releasing nerve terminals (especially those of mossy fibers in the CA3 region). Because activation of these presynaptic potassium channels reduces anoxic glutamate release, they may be a useful target for specific drug therapy that might prevent the excitoxic effects of excessive glutamate release during anoxia/ischemia. 
Sexual function of women taking antihypertensive agents: a comparative study. OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to evaluate the effects of clonidine and prazosin on sexual function in hypertensive women. DESIGN: Crossover, active-drug controlled pilot study. SETTING: Community recruitment to a university-based teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Ten premenopausal and eight postmenopausal women with mild hypertension and unimpaired sexual function. INTERVENTION: Periodic, self-administered daily diaries assessed the sexual arousal and desire and orgasmic function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using analysis of variance for orgasmic characteristics and comparison of the percentages of yes responses to the sexual function questions, no significant difference in the levels of sexual function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin was found. However, there was a suggestion that clonidine and prazosin affected some aspects of sexual function. Of the women who received clonidine first, fewer were receptive to partner approach during medication therapy (49%) than during placebo (61%). Fewer women wished for their partners to approach them (WISH) during therapy (41% and 53% for clonidine and prazosin, respectively) than during placebo (60%). In the group that received prazosin first, WISH was affected (32% for prazosin, 31% for clonidine, 45% for placebo). Orgasmic strength increased from 2.1 on placebo to 2.7 on clonidine (second medication), measured on a four-point Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study developed a method using self-administered daily diaries for evaluating the effects of antihypertensive agents on sexual function in hypertensive women. These potential effects need to be evaluated in larger studies. 
A review of 13-years experience of osteosarcoma. Since the inception of the authors' facility, 365 patients with osteogenic sarcoma have been treated. While other facilities were surgically treating patients with primary amputation, this facility attempted limb-salvage surgery. The majority of patients being treated with limb-salvage surgery had the resected bone replaced by a metallic endoprosthetic replacement. The emphasis on conservative surgery led to the development of growing endoprosthetic replacements with the first being used in 1975. The cumulative survival of those patients with Stage 2 osteosarcoma treated at this facility between 1977 and 1984 is 48% at five years. 
Sucralfate versus cimetidine in the treatment of reflux esophagitis, with special reference to the esophageal motor function. Sixty patients entered a double-blind clinical trial comparing the effect of 1 g of sucralfate granulate given four times daily and cimetidine, 400 mg twice daily. Twenty-six patients treated with sucralfate and 26 treated with cimetidine were examined with short-term pH monitoring before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Thirty patients, 19 treated with cimetidine and 11 treated with sucralfate, had esophageal motility studied by a radionuclide test before and after 12 weeks of treatment. The efficacy of the treatments was judged by symptoms and endoscopic response after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The endpoint healing rate was approximately 60% in both groups and symptoms were relieved in half of the patients in both groups (difference not significant). The effect of the treatments on pH and number of spikes reflected the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the drugs, whereas the mean transit time (MTT) was not changed by the treatments. The residual activity after radionuclide transit in the sitting position was significantly increased after treatment with cimetidine. The data support the hypothesis that primary dysmotility might be involved in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis in about 33% of the patients. Possibilities for a combination therapy with sucralfate and cimetidine are stressed. 
Nifedipine reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and transient ischemia in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. A randomized study was performed on 104 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to examine whether the infusion of nifedipine (n = 53) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and necrosis in the early postoperative period. Continuous hemodynamic and three-channel Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours and serial assessment of serum enzymes and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed for 36 hours postoperatively. Nifedipine (minimum dose, 10 micrograms/kg/hr for 24 hours) was applied from the onset of extracorporal circulation. The control group (n = 51) received nitroglycerin (minimum dose, 1 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours). Using the combined analyses of electrocardiography and Holter recordings, myocardial ischemia was defined as being either a transient ischemic event (TIE), transient coronary spasm (TCS), or myocardial infarction (MI). The two groups did not differ with respect to preoperative New York Heart Association classification, age, history of myocardial infarction, extracorporal circulation and aortic cross-clamp time, number of distal anastomoses, or systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia was substantially lower in the nifedipine than in the nitroglycerin group [TIE: three of 53 patients (6%) versus nine of 50 patients (18%), p less than 0.001; MI: two of 53 patients (4%) versus six of 50 patients (12%), p less than 0.001; and TCS: none of 53 patients (0%) versus two of 50 patients (4%), p = NS]. 
The plain abdominal film accurately estimates extent of active ulcerative colitis. The aim of our study was to establish whether plain abdominal film can accurately assess the extent of active ulcerative colitis. Ninety-seven ulcerative colitis patients were studied, in whom the extent of the macroscopic lesion was established either by colonoscopy (n = 75) or by resection (n = 22). Of these, 42 had proctosigmoiditis, 12 left-sided colitis, 12 subtotal colitis, and 31 total colitis. Nine well-tested features were used for the radiological classification of lesion extent. The radiologists were not given any clinical information. Seventy-eight patients (80.4%) were correctly classified by plain abdominal film (r = 0.86); the best concordance was achieved for proctosigmoiditis and total colitis (80.9 and 90.3%, respectively). In total colitis the most reliable radiological features were "irregularity of the mucosal edge" and "increased thickness of the colon wall, " which were present in 74.2 and 67.7%, respectively, of the correctly classified patients. The fourfold combination of these two features with "loss of haustral clefts" and "empty right colon" was present only in patients with total colitis, and at least one of these features was present in all but one of them. Conversely, all nine abnormalities were absent in 73.8% of patients with proctosigmoiditis. In conclusion, plain abdominal film is a reliable tool for judging the extent of lesion in active ulcerative colitis. It seems particularly accurate in total colitis, where, in the acute phases, it is most important to avoid invasive examinations. 
Phencyclidine increased release of beta-endorphin from anterior lobe of the pituitary. Phencyclidine (PCP) has been found to affect neuroendocrine function by altering the release of the anterior pituitary hormones, adrenocorticotrophin, luteinizing hormone and prolactin. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PCP on release of the two pituitary hormones also derived from the adrenocorticotropin precursor, namely, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin (beta-E), synthesized in the neurointermediate and anterior lobes of the pituitary. At behaviorally active doses, PCP administered i.c.v. increased plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-E (i beta-E) without affecting the concentration of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, suggesting that PCP increased the release of beta-E from only the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Dexamethasone pretreatment blocked the PCP-induced increase in i beta-E which indicated further the anterior lobe effects of PCP. MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), a selective PCP ligand, at behaviorally active doses also increased the plasma concentration of i beta-E. The dose-response curves for induction of behavior was very different from that for increasing the concentration of i beta-E in plasma. The increase in release of i beta-E was stereoselective as (+)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine but not (-)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine increased release of i beta-E. The increase in plasma levels of beta-E was not due to an interaction with opioid receptors because naloxone did not block PCP-induced release of beta-E. In vitro, PCP also significantly increased release of i beta-E from anterior lobe of the pituitary. 
A phase II trial of intraperitoneal cisplatin and etoposide as salvage treatment for minimal residual ovarian carcinoma. We conducted a phase II study of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) as salvage therapy in patients with ovarian cancer who had persistent disease or who had relapsed after primary systemic chemotherapy and had residual disease of less than 2 cm. Two hundred eleven courses of IP chemotherapy consisting of CDDP 200 mg/m2 and VP-16 350 mg/m2 were administered. All patients received intravenous (IV) thiosulfate protection. Treatment was given once every 4 weeks for a median of six cycles. Twenty-four of 37 assessable patients were clinically free of disease at the end of treatment (normal physical exam, computed tomographic [CT] scan, CA-125 and peritoneal cytology); one patient had a partial response. Ten of these 24 patients consented to reexploration at the end of treatment, and nine were in pathologic complete remission, while one patient had positive peritoneal washings as her only evidence of persistent disease. The median survival of the 37 patients was 26 months from the first day of IP treatment and 51 months from diagnosis. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, with median nadir WBC, granulocyte, and platelet counts of 2,400, 684, and 134,000/mm3, respectively. There was no cumulative renal damage, hypomagnesemia, or chemical peritonitis. We conclude that IP CDDP and VP-16 can produce pathologic complete remissions when used as a second-line regimen for patients with ovarian cancer who have received systemic cisplatin-based therapy and have less than 2 cm disease. 
Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy: an interim report. Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy was evaluated in 586 men who were followed for 1 1/2 to 8 years (median followup 4 years, 166 men followed 5 years or longer). The 5-year actuarial rate was 4% for local recurrence alone, 5% for distant metastases alone, 2% for distant metastases in association with local recurrence and 3% for death of or with disease, while 10% of the men had elevated levels of prostate specific antigen without local recurrence or distant metastases. When the actuarial status at 5 years was evaluated by clinical stage there was local recurrence alone in 0% of men with a clinical stage A1 or B1 nodule, and 4% with stage B1, 7% with stage A2 and 8% with stage B2 disease. When evaluated by pathological stage at 5 years local recurrence alone was noted in 2% of men with organ-confined disease, 8% with specimen-confined disease and 8% in whom the disease involved the surgical margin, seminal vesicles or pelvic lymph nodes. Recognizing that two-thirds to three-quarters of all local recurrences occur within the first 5 years, these data suggest that the anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy is associated with local control rates that are equal to or greater than other series reported in the literature. However, without a randomized study it is impossible to compare one clinical series to another, and followup evaluations at 10 and 15 years will be necessary to confirm these findings. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
Predominant expression of lambda light chain in adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. The authors investigated cytoplasmic immunoglobulins of the leukemic cells from 20 adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and from three cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis using immunoelectron microscopy. They also studied these cases using various monoclonal antibodies. Of the 23 examined cases, nine were negative for both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins; the authors defined these as common ALL. Two cases were positive for the mu chain but were negative for light chains; the authors defined these as pre-B-cell ALL. The remaining 12 cases were positive for either kappa or lambda light chains; these were defined as B-cell ALL. Of the 12 cases positive for light chains, 11 were positive for the lambda chain. Seven cases of the 11 positive cases for the lambda chain were negative for heavy chains. Eleven cases were positive either for both My4 and My9 or for one of the two antibodies. From these results, the authors conclude the following: (1) the ratio of pre-B-cell ALL among non-T-cell ALL cases (two of 23 cases) was lower in adults than in children; (2) of the light chain-positive cases, the lambda light chain-positive cases predominated (11 of 12 cases); (3) heavy chain-negative, lambda chain-positive cases (seven cases) were observed; and (4) one half of the leukemia cases showed dual phenotypes of B-cell and myeloid cell lineages. 
Abnormal methylation of the calcitonin gene marks progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The clinical aspects of disease progression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are well established, but the nature of the molecular events responsible is not known. We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML. 
Coronary atherosclerotic plaques with and without thrombus in ischemic heart syndromes: a morphologic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical study. We investigated incidence, severity, and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis, acute thrombosis, and plaque fissuring in ischemic heart disease (both unstable-acute syndromes and chronic ischemia) and in nonischemic controls. We also studied the structural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical profile of plaques, with and without thrombus, including morphometry, immunophenotyping of inflammatory infiltrates, cytokine presence, and ultrastructural features. Critical coronary stenosis was almost the rule in both acute and chronic ischemic series (greater than 90%) whereas it reached 50% in control subjects. Thrombosis was principally characteristic of unstable-acute ischemic syndromes (unstable angina, 32%; acute myocardial infarction, 52%; cardiac sudden death, 26%) but was also found in chronic ischemia (stable angina, 12%; ischemic cardiomyopathy, 14%) and in control subjects (4%). Plaque fissuring without thrombus occurred in low percentages in lipid-rich, severe eccentric plaques in most series. Major differences were found between pultaceous-rich versus fibrous plaques rather than between plaques with or without thrombus. Pultaceous-rich plaques were frequent in sites of critical stenosis, thrombosis, and ulceration. Inflammatory infiltrates, i.e., T cells, macrophages, and a few beta cells, mostly occurred in lipid-rich, plaques unrelated to thrombus. In adventitia, infiltrates were a common finding unrelated to any syndrome. Necrotizing cytokines such as alpha-TNF were immunohistochemically detected in macrophages, smooth muscle, and intimal cells and detected by immunoblotting in 67% of pultaceous-rich plaques, either with or without thrombus. Immune response mediators such as IL-2 were also expressed in analogous plaques but in a minor percentage (50%-40%). Media were extensively damaged in severely diseased vessels with and without thrombus. Ultrastructural study showed that the fibrous cap was either highly cellular or densely fibrillar. Intimal injury with collagen exposure was often associated with platelet adhesion, whereas foamy cell exposure was not. In conclusion, investigated parameters were essentially similar in plaques, both with and without thrombus, whereas major differences were found between pultaceous-rich and fibrous plaques. Since platelets adhere to exposed collagen and not to foam cells, the type of exposed substrates could play a major role in thrombosis. 
5-Hydroxytryptamine and the pathophysiology of migraine. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has long been implicated in the aetiology of migraine but the evidence remains circumstantial and certainly not definitive. Numerous papers have reviewed the background which is briefly outlined here. Although the continued belief in the primary involvement of 5-HT in the genesis of a migraine attack has recently been questioned, many antimigraine drugs undeniably interact potently with 5-HT receptors. It can be argued, however, that their modest clinical benefit results from their pharmacological effects, be they mediated through 5-HT receptors or otherwise, independently of any pathophysiological involvement of endogenous 5-HT. Nevertheless, there seems convincing evidence that central release of 5-HT by various drug mechanisms causes migraine-like headache in migraineurs. It remains to be seen whether these drugs mimic the pathological event initiating the spontaneous migraine attack. Regardless of these considerations, the focus of research on 5-HT and migraine has proved to be enormously profitable over several decades, culminating recently in the identification of a novel, potentially important, antimigraine drug for the treatment of the acute attack. This drug, sumatriptan, is a selective cranial vasoconstrictor which mediates this effect by specifically activating a particular 5-HT1 receptor subtype. Undoubtedly a precise understanding of its clinical mechanism of action, which is currently being studied by a number of groups, will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of migraine. Perhaps this in turn will help in finally determining whether migraine is a vascular disease and whether or not a disturbance of 5-HT is just epiphenomenal or is truly the primary initiating pathological event. 
Beta-galactosidase tablets in the treatment of lactose intolerance in pediatrics. Lactose-intolerant children manifest diminished or nonexistent intestinal lactase activity, resulting in flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. To assess the hydrolytic capability of lactase-containing tablets taken immediately before oral lactose challenge, we studied 18 children previously identified as being lactose intolerant and having no underlying organic gastrointestinal disease. Subjects had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 11.4 +/- 3.4 years; 72% were male. At time of the study, lactase-containing tablets or placebo tablets were ingested (double-blind) immediately before drinking a solution of lactose. Breath samples were obtained for hydrogen analysis at 30-minute intervals during a 2-hour period, and clinical symptoms were monitored. In lactose-intolerant patients, hydrogen production was significantly greater following placebo (maximum hydrogen excretion, approximately 60 ppm) compared with lactase-containing tablets (maximum hydrogen excretion, 7 ppm). Increased hydrogen production was associated with clinical symptoms including abdominal pain (89% of subjects following placebo ingestion), bloating (83%), diarrhea (61%), and flatulence (44%). These results indicate, therefore, that coingestion of lactose and lactase-containing tablets significantly reduces both breath hydrogen excretion and clinical symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. 
Absorbable rings for pediatric valvuloplasty. Preliminary study. Secondary valvular stenosis is a significant risk of annular ring implantation during valvular repair in children. To avoid this problem, we have developed an absorbable prosthetic ring (APR), which induces the generation of a biologic fibroelastic ring with mitotic capability and thereby allows atrioventricular annulus growth with age. Twelve polydioxanone (PDS) biodegradable APRs were surgically implanted in immature goats. To avoid possible embolic complications from ring fragments during the absorption period, APRs were covered with an extensible sewing sheath of high-porosity polyester, allowing contact between the PDS, blood, and endocardium. Four APRs were implanted into the right atrial cavity, four in the tricuspid position, and four in the mitral position. Histological studies at 6 months showed a considerable amount of remaining PDS. At 1 year, only small residual fragments of PDS were present, surrounded by collagen and elastic fibers as well as fibroblasts with mitotic activity. This histological structure represents a new biologic fibroelastic ring, which has originated from PDS rings. Echocardiography at 12 months showed that the elasticity of APRs and fibrotic tissue allows normal systolic and diastolic valve motions. These findings, which demonstrate histological changes in native valve annuli as well as stable and elastic annuloplasty without secondary stenosis in growing animals, call for new studies involving hearts with valvular disease. 
Improvement in oxygen tensions and pulmonary blood flow with intermittent distal aortic compression during normoxia, hypoxic hypoxia, and hyperoxia in neonatal piglets. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that, in a newborn piglet during normoxia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia, increasing aortic pressure transiently by intermittent short-duration aortic compression would affect left-to-right shunting of blood and thus increase pulmonary artery blood flow, pulmonary arterial PO2, and aortic PO2 proximal to the point of compression. We also investigated whether a balloon atrial septostomy, by providing an open channel for communication between the right- and left-sided circulations, would further improve pulmonary blood flow and aortic PO2. Studies were performed in eight 7- to 10-day-old newborn piglets in three phases (FIO2 of 0.21, 0.12, and 1.0) before and after balloon arterial septostomy in each piglet. Blood gas measurements and hemodynamic variables were recorded before and at the end of a 30-sec period of aortic compression. RESULTS: During aortic compression, all the animals demonstrated a 50 to 70 mm Hg increase in aortic pressure proximal to the compression. Before balloon septostomy, there were 21%, 41%, and 8% increases in aortic PO2 in the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. There were also statistically significant increments in pulmonary blood flow and arterial pressures. After balloon septostomy, there were 35%, 25%, and 21% increments in aortic PO2 during the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant further improvement in the effects of aortic compression on PO2 with septostomy compared with those effects before septostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic arterial pressures in order to forcibly affect left-to-right shunting of blood may be potentially beneficial in the management of hypoxia in situations where low pulmonary artery blood flow may be contributing to hypoxia, e.g., in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 
Pathophysiology of ischaemia reperfusion injury: central role of the neutrophil. Ischaemia is a common clinical event leading to local and remote injury. Evidence indicates that tissue damage is largely caused by activated neutrophils which accumulate when the tissue is reperfused. If the area of ischaemic tissue is large, neutrophils also sequester in the lungs, inducing non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Ischaemia reperfusion injury is initiated by production of reactive oxygen species which initially appear responsible for the generation of chemotactic activity for neutrophils. Later, once adherent to endothelium, neutrophils mediate damage by secretion of additional reactive oxygen species as well as proteolytic enzymes, in particular elastase. Therapeutic options for limiting ischaemia reperfusion injury include inhibition of oxygen radical formation, pharmacological prevention of neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, and also the use of monoclonal antibodies which prevent neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, a prerequisite for injury. 
Hemostatic wrapping of ruptured liver in two postpartum patients. A variety of surgical techniques with variable success rates have been reported in the management of the spontaneously ruptured liver in pregnancy. We managed two cases of postpartum ruptured liver by wrapping the liver in hemostatic material. Hemostatic encapsulation effectively controlled massive bleeding of ruptured livers in two postpartum patients. 
Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A genetic disorder of cardiovascular regulation. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency is a genetic disorder in which affected patients cannot synthesize norepinephrine, epinephrine, and octopamine in either the central nervous system or the peripheral autonomic neurons. Dopamine acts as a false neurotransmitter in their noradrenergic neurons. Neonates with DBH deficiency have had episodic hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension, but survivors sometimes cope relatively well until late childhood when overwhelming orthostatic hypotension profoundly limits their activities. The hypotension may be so severe that clonic seizures supervene. Most currently recognized patients are young or middle-aged adults. The diagnosis is established by the observation of severe orthostatic hypotension in a patient whose plasma norepinephrine/dopamine ratio is much less than one. 
High-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of experimental liver cancer. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was used to treat Morris rat hepatoma 3924A implanted in the liver. Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity. One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each. Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not. All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment. Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies. Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment. Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis. An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each. Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride. Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4. These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors. 
Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for gastrointestinal lymphoma. Between 1973 and 1989, 49 patients with gastrointestinal lymphomas were treated at the Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, and followed in the tumor registry. The purpose of this review was to determine the influence of treatment on long-term survival of these patients. The mean age was 63 years (range: 38 to 83 years). There were 33 men and 16 women. The primary tumor sites were gastric 33 (67%), small bowel 11 (22%), and colon 5 (10%). Common signs and/or symptoms at presentation were pain (n = 38), bleeding (n = 11), and weight loss (n = 14). The diagnostic sensitivities of contrast radiography, computed tomography, and endoscopic biopsy were 76%, 89%, and 79%, respectively. Forty-eight patients were treated, and one received supportive care only. Thirty-one patients had surgical resections, 33 patients had chemotherapy, and 16 patients had radiotherapy. Most (n = 30) had multimodality treatment. Statistically significant variables affecting survival rates in patients with gastric lymphomas were lower tumor stage, younger patient age, and surgical resection. 
Steatocystoma multiplex: appearance at mammography. The authors present mammographic findings in a patient with steatocystoma multiplex. Numerous oil cysts were seen in both breasts at mammography. The mammographic appearance is characteristic of, if not pathognomonic for, steatocystoma multiplex. 
Alterations of platelet membrane microviscosity in essential hypertension. 1. The metabolism of blood platelets, taken as an accessible model of excitable cells, has been reported to be altered in hypertension. Most of the identified alterations concern the functions of various plasma membrane constituents. 2. A possible modification of membrane microviscosity was investigated by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence depolarization. In order to determine whether or not the membrane structures probed by these indicators were related to platelet physiological functions, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was determined in parallel. 3. At physiological temperature, the fluorescence anisotropy of 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was decreased in untreated hypertensive patients (0.276 +/- 0.002 versus 0.288 +/- 0.002, n = 23 and 22, P less than 0.001), indicating a lowered microviscosity at the lipid-water interface of cell membrane. It correlated inversely with blood pressure (P less than 0.001) and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.030). On the contrary, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy was observed to vary with sex but not with blood pressure. 4. These results suggest that structural membrane modifications may participate in the various functional abnormalities observed in platelets from hypertensive patients. 
Bursitis of the tensor veli palatini muscle with an osteophyte on the pterygoid hamulus. Many patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and/or myofascial pain syndrome have numerous symptoms. In cases of multiple complaints, an attempt should be made to resolve symptoms on a step-by-step basis. In this case report, a patient was treated for only one of her numerous complaints, that is, a burning sensation on her palate when she touched the right tuberosity area with her tongue or finger. 
Oxygen transport in adult respiratory distress syndrome and other acute circulatory problems: relationship of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence that oxygen consumption (VO2) is pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2). DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1972 with their relevant bibliographies and computerized search of MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical papers reporting the relationship of: VO2 to DO2 in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, other critically ill patients, and normal individuals; cardiac output determined by measured VO2 to calculated VO2 from the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference; blood lactate to DO2; and selected basic science studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all pertinent data were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA EXTRACTION: Normal individuals display physiologic dependence of VO2 at very low levels of DO2 (330 mL/min.m2). Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2 entails two concepts: a) VO2 varies directly with DO2 over a wide range of DO2 and b) of particular import, tissue oxygen extraction is compromised. This pathologic supply dependence was initially identified in patients with ARDS; subsequently, it has been demonstrated in patients with sepsis and in a variety of other critically ill individuals. There are substantial, but not uniform, data documenting this dependence of VO2 on DO2 in ARDS. In some studies, this relationship correlates best with increased lactate concentrations. However, increased blood lactate concentrations do not accurately track other evidence of tissue hypoxia. Some researchers have attributed the finding of this supply dependency to artifact, when VO2 is determined by the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference. However, when these methods are compared, the correlation is excellent. Others have raised the concern that appreciable changes in VO2, even over short periods of time, may result in physiologic increases in DO2. However, when "control" groups have been contemporaneously compared with patients with ARDS using the same methodology, they have not shown supply dependency. Interwoven throughout the studies reviewed is overwhelming and uniform evidence that both mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2) and mixed venous oxygen content (CVO2) correlate poorly with cardiac output, DO2, or VO2. The inconsistencies in identifying pathologic DO2 dependency may well reflect the unknown variables that exist in patients with ARDS, perhaps better labeled, multiple organ system failure. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2, especially the inability to increase tissue oxygen extraction, is present in most patients with ARDS and many other critically ill individuals. PVO2 and CVO2 are both unreliable indicators of cardiac output, DO2, or VO2. 
Long-term patency of the aortofemoral Dacron graft. A graft limb related study over a 25-years period. Graft limb patency was studied retrospectively in a consecutive series of 912 patients (1605 limbs), who received an aorto(bi)femoral Dacron graft for occlusive disease over a 25 years period (1963-1987). The mean follow-up for the series was 5.35 years (range 1 month to 23 years) and 18.5% of the patients were followed for at least 10 years. Primary patency decreased progressively to 83% at 10 years and 77% at 15 years. It was significantly improved to 90% (at 10 years) and 84% (at 15 years) by means of operative thrombectomy (secondary patency). Factors influencing patency (univariate analysis) were (1) concomitant femoropopliteal occlusive disease, (2) the site of the femoral anastomosis and (3) the date of the operation. Multivariate analysis in relation to the femoral anastomosis stressed the importance of profunda femoris artery disease and the date of operation. It is concluded that the negative effects of concomitant superficial femoral artery disease may be completely relieved by an adequate profundaplasty. Furthermore the substantial progress, we documented over the years of the study, supports our view that aortofemoral reconstruction may also be offered as the solution of choice to patients with milder forms of claudication. 
Behavioral arousal in newborn infants and its association with termination of apnea. Arousal is an important protective mechanism that aids in the resolution of obstructive sleep apnea in adults and children, but its role in neonatal apnea has not been investigated. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of arousal in the termination of apnea in preterm infants. Videorecording was used to identify spontaneous behavioral arousal in a group of healthy full-term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 10) infants before and during polygraphic monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables and in a group of preterm infants with apnea (n = 10) during similar polygraphic monitoring. Spontaneous arousal rates (mean +/- SE) in full-term infants before and during polygraphic monitoring were 0.18 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 episodes/min, respectively. Corresponding values in nonapneic preterm infants were 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 episodes/min. In apneic preterm infants, mean spontaneous arousal rate during polygraphic recording was 0.26 +/- 0.02, but it was considerably higher during apneic sleep periods (0.59 +/- 0.17) than during nonapneic sleep periods (0.25 +/- 0.01). The frequency of occurrence of arousal was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in long vs. short apnea, mixed vs. central apnea, and severe vs. mild apnea. Although a clear association between arousal and apneic resolution was observed in preterm infants, lack of arousal responses in a large number of apneic episodes suggests that behavioral arousal is not essential for the termination of apnea in these infants. 
Superiority of granisetron to dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Trials of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists have shown excellent antiemetic activity for chemotherapy containing cisplatin when compared with high-dose metoclopramide. There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations). During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis. There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events. We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents. 
Pulsed-spray thrombolysis of arterial and bypass graft occlusions. Pulsed-spray thrombolysis is accomplished through forceful injection of a spray of highly concentrated urokinase into clot by using catheters with multiple side holes. We previously reported the immediate technical efficacy of the method in eight arterial and 10 bypass graft occlusions. We now describe the clinical efficacy of the method in a second, larger series of 23 native artery occlusions and 25 bypass graft occlusions. Transluminal angioplasty was performed after thrombolysis in 21 of the arteries and 24 of the bypass grafts. Initial thrombolysis was observed in all artery occlusions and all but one bypass graft occlusion with an average time for pulsed-spray lysis of 65 +/- 28 min in native arteries and 93 +/- 38 min in bypass grafts. Recanalization with improvement in symptoms or distal pulses after thrombolysis and angioplasty was achieved in 74% of treated arterial occlusions and 92% of treated graft occlusions. Of the 15 arteries that were recanalized and did not require adjunctive surgery, seven remained patent at 3-28 months follow-up. Nine of 23 recanalized bypass grafts required early adjunctive surgery. Of the nine synthetic and five saphenous vein grafts successfully recanalized and not requiring surgical revision, the mean patency was 4.3 +/- 3.1 months and 3.0 +/- 2.2 months, respectively. Minor complications were seen in 23% of cases. The two major complications (4%) involved one groin hematoma requiring surgery and one episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conclude that combined pulsed-spray thrombolysis and angioplasty achieve rapid and consistent arterial and graft recanalization with minimal risk. The method offers a favorable alternative to standard thrombolytic therapy of arterial occlusions. In occluded synthetic and vein bypass grafts, the technique is sometimes beneficial, either alone or combined with surgical revision. 
Globus pharyngeus: long-term follow-up and prognostic factors. A prospective trial of 80 patients with globus pharyngeus is reported. An in-depth analysis of the typical history at presentation is given. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 21 to 42 months). The asymptomatic rate at this interval was 25%, with a further 35% reporting a significant improvement in symptoms. Three independent factors were found to influence prognosis (p less than .05). These were sex, length of history at consultation, and the presence or absence of associated throat symptoms. Male patients having a history of the globus symptom for less than 3 months and not complaining of any associated throat symptoms had the best chance of becoming asymptomatic or symptomatically improved. The presence or absence of heartburn or its treatment had no bearing on outcome. 
A cohort study of stomach cancer in a high-risk American population. Demographic, smoking and dietary information was obtained from a cohort of 17,633 white American men, largely of Scandinavian and German descent, who responded to a mailed questionnaire in 1966. After 20 years of follow-up, 50% to 90% increases in mortality from stomach cancer (75 deaths) were found among foreign-born, their children, and among residents of the North Central states. An association was seen with low educational attainment and laboring or semiskilled occupations, primarily among immigrants and their children. Risk was evaluated in subjects who regularly smoked cigarettes (RR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.8). A significant dose-response trend was observed, with subjects who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day having more than a five-fold increased risk compared with those who never smoked. Elevated risks were also found for pipe smoking and smokeless tobacco use, but not for alcohol consumption. Analysis of dietary consumption of nine food groups revealed no significant associations with stomach cancer. However, total carbohydrate intake and a few individual food items (salted fish, bacon, cooked cereal, milk, and apples) were associated with increased risk. The findings of this prospective study of a high-risk population add to the limited evidence relating tobacco consumption to stomach cancer risk and suggest clues to ethnic, geographic, and dietary risk factors. 
False-positive immunostaining of normal epithelia and carcinomas with ascites fluid preparations of antimelanoma monoclonal antibody HMB45. HMB45 is a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody that has found widespread use in diagnostic pathology. Recent reports, however, have suggested that this antibody may cross-react with a small number of carcinomas and other epithelial cells. The authors tested the hypothesis that these latter reports represent examples of false-positive immunostaining by comparing the immunostaining on breast, salivary gland, and lung tumors with the following: (1) a commercial ascites preparation of this monoclonal antibody; (2) a protein A-purified antibody preparation derived from ascites fluid; and (3) supernatant fluid obtained from the hybridoma cell line. The authors found that all examples of nonmelanoma immunostaining in the carcinomas tested were eliminated with the nonascites fluid preparations, whereas strong immunostaining of melanomas was retained. The authors conclude that contaminated commercial ascites fluid preparations of HMB45 may account for most, if not all, of the reports of nonmelanoma immunostaining with HMB45. 
Evaluation of right ventricular regional perfusion with technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT. To evaluate technetium-99m-sestamibi as a right ventricular perfusion imaging agent, 25 normal volunteers and 25 patients with suspected coronary disease were studied with both sestamibi and thallium-201 SPECT. All patients underwent cardiac characterization. Compared to thallium-201 images, visualization of the right ventricle was superior for sestamibi in all cases. After computer masking of the left ventricle, count profiles for each 6-mm right ventricular short-axis slice were extracted and plotted in a bull's-eye type polar map with images normalized to maximal right ventricular counts. On sestamibi right ventricular polar maps, 7 of 11 patients (64%) with right coronary stenosis had fixed or reversible inferior right ventricular defects. None of the 25 volunteers or patients without right coronary stenosis had right ventricular defects (true-negative rate = 100%). We conclude that sestamibi SPECT provides an accurate means to assess right ventricular regional perfusion, with data presentation and interpretation facilitated by the polar map display. 
Lack of increased bleeding after liver biopsy in patients with mild hemostatic abnormalities. Prophylactic transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets are sometimes given to patients with mild elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and mild thrombocytopenia before percutaneous liver biopsy. To determine whether PTs and PTTs 1.1-1.5 times midrange normal levels and platelet counts 50-99 x 10(9)/L are associated with increased bleeding complications, hospital records of all patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy during 56 consecutive months (n = 291) were reviewed. Complete information was available for 177 inpatient procedures (155 standard, 22 fine needle). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications in patients with platelet counts greater than or equal to 50 X 10(9)/L was 3.4% (6 of 175), with no significant difference between patients with mild hemostatic abnormalities and patients with normal parameters. These data suggest that prophylactic transfusions may not be necessary. One factor was highly associated with bleeding complications: a patient diagnosis of malignancy, 14% (7 of 50) compared with 0.8% (1 of 127) among other patients (P less than 0.001). These patients should be monitored closely after biopsy. 
Serum gastrin increases with increasing dietary calcium but not with increasing dietary fat or fiber in Fischer-344 rats. We studied the effects of dietary calcium, fat and fiber on serum gastrin in Fischer-344 rats in a full factorial experiment as part of a larger study of diet and colon cancer risk factors. Nine- to 10-wk-old male rats were fed standard or experimental diets for 4 wk. Wheat bran was the sole source of fiber. Wheat bran levels were 0, 2.5, 10 and 20%; fat levels were 1, 5 and 10%; calcium levels were 0.18, 0.52 and 1.04% of diet weight. On d 29 serum was collected and stored at -80 degrees C until analyzed. There was a significant (P less than 0.0001) dose-dependent increase in serum gastrin from 102 to 173 ng/L, with increasing calcium. No other significant changes in serum gastrin were noted with the dietary changes. A long-term change in the level of serum gastrin, caused by dietary modification, will influence the trophic effect that gastrin has on colonic mucosa as well as on colon carcinomas. We speculate that calcium supplementation, although slowing colonic proliferation, might have an undesirable effect on the growth of early undetected colonic tumors. 
The detrimental effects of intravenous crystalloid after aortotomy in swine We tested the hypothesis that, after aortotomy, rapidly replacing three times the blood volume deficit with intravenous crystalloid will increase hemorrhage and decrease survival. Sixteen anesthetized Yorkshire swine underwent splenectomy and stainless steel wire placement in the infrarenal aorta and were instrumented with pulmonary artery and carotid artery catheters. The wire was pulled, producing a 5 mm aortotomy and spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The animals had been alternately assigned to either an untreated control group (n = 8) or a treatment group (n = 8), which received 80 ml/kg lactated Ringer's solution intravenously. The volume of hemorrhage and the mortality rate were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in the treatment group receiving lactated Ringer's solution relative to the control animals (2142 +/- 178 ml versus 783 +/- 85 ml, and eight of eight animals versus zero of eight animals, respectively). From these data we conclude that, in this model of uncontrolled arterial hemorrhage resulting from abdominal aortotomy, rapidly administering lactated Ringer's solution intravenously significantly increases hemorrhage and death. 
Anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of severe B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome following bone marrow and organ transplantation. BACKGROUND. The B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome is an infrequent life-threatening complication of marrow or organ transplantation that is the consequence of profound immunosuppression. The results of treatment have been disappointing, although a small number of patients have been cured by chemoradiotherapy or antiviral agents after a reduction in the dosage of immunosuppressive therapy. We report here the results of treating this disorder with anti-B-cell antibodies. METHODS. Twenty-six patients in whom aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome developed after bone marrow (n = 14) or organ (n = 12) transplantation received 0.2 mg of CD21-specific and of CD24-specific antibodies per kilogram of body weight for 10 consecutive days in an open, prospective, multicenter trial. RESULTS. The treatment was well tolerated. All patients had transient neutropenia, apparently because the CD24 molecule is also expressed on granulocytes. The treatment was ineffective in seven patients with monoclonal B-cell proliferation. In contrast, 16 patients with oligoclonal B-cell proliferation had complete remission. Systemic remission also occurred in two other patients with oligoclonal proliferation who had central nervous system involvement, although they subsequently died because of progression of the central nervous system disease. In one patient who died early, clonality was not determined. Of the 16 patients who had complete remission, 2 with persistent immunodeficiency due to graft (marrow) rejection or acute graft-versus-host disease had a relapse, and the 1 with graft-versus-host disease subsequently died. Eleven patients were alive and disease-free after a median follow-up of 35 months (5 of 14 marrow recipients and 6 of 12 organ recipients). Four other patients in complete remission died of unrelated causes 4 to 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous administration of anti-B-cell antibodies may be effective in controlling diffuse, severe, oligoclonal B-cell proliferation not involving the central nervous system. 
Excision of cavernous angioma with preservation of coexisting venous angioma. Case report. The case of a patient presenting with dysphasic seizures due to a cavernous angioma coexisting with a venous malformation is reported. The cavernous angioma was resected with preservation of the venous malformation, as confirmed by postoperative studies. The patient was seizure-free following surgery. 
Effects of spinal kappa-opioid receptor agonists on the responsiveness of nociceptive superficial dorsal horn neurons. Spinal cord application of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists dynorphin (50 nmol) or (1S,2S)U-50,488H (0.19-1.9 mumol) produced changes in the excitability of some superficial dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. One-third of the cells exhibited expansion of their receptive fields as defined using mechanical stimuli following a spinal kappa agonist (dynorphin or U-50,488H); receptive field expansions were of the same order as those observed immediately after a conditioning electrical stimulus applied to a peripheral nerve. In addition, spinal U-50,488H produced changes in mechanical and thermal thresholds of the majority of superficial dorsal horn neurons. These changes were dose-dependent. Facilitation of responses occurred at lower doses and inhibition occurred primarily at higher doses, but these effects were not reversed by subsequent administration of naloxone. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that one action of increases in spinal dynorphin levels due to peripheral inflammation, tissue injury or nerve damage, is to contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability in superficial dorsal horn neurons. 
Thyroid cancer: a lethal endocrine neoplasm. This conference focuses on the controversies about managing thyroid cancer, emphasizing the possibility that the treatment of patients with potentially fatal thyroid cancer may be improved. Although the mortality rate from thyroid cancer is low, it is the highest among cancers affecting the endocrine glands (excluding the ovary). Exposure to radiation during childhood in the 1930s and 1940s increased the incidence of but not the mortality from thyroid cancer, because these tumors are mainly papillary cancers developing in young adults. These rates may change as the exposed cohort ages. Risk factors that increase mortality include older patient age and the growth characteristics of the tumor at diagnosis, the presence of distant metastases, and cell type (for example, the tall-cell variants of papillary cancer, follicular cancer [to be distinguished from the more benign follicular variant of papillary cancer], medullary cancer, and anaplastic cancer). Local metastases in lymph nodes do not seem to increase the risk for death from papillary cancer, but they do increase the risk for death from follicular and medullary cancer. In the latter, mortality is decreased by the early detection and treatment of patients with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2a. There are excellent tumor markers for differentiated cancer of the parafollicular and of the follicular cells (serum calcitonin and serum thyroglobulin levels, respectively). Measuring the calcitonin level allows early diagnosis of familial medullary cancer, whereas measuring the thyroglobulin level, although useful only after total thyroidectomy, allows early recognition of recurrence or metastases of papillary or follicular cancer. Initial surgery, protocols for follow-up, and the use of radioiodine for the ablation of any residual thyroid and the treatment of metastatic cancer are discussed. Because these tumors resist currently available chemotherapy regimens, possible ways to increase the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy are considered as are new approaches to treatment. 
Cancer risk after iodine-131 therapy for hyperthyroidism. Cancer incidence was studied in 10,552 patients (mean age, 57 years) who received 131I therapy (mean dose, 506 MBq) for hyperthyroidism between 1950 and 1975. Follow-up on these patients was continued for an average of 15 years. Record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register for the period 1958-1985 identified 1543 cancers occurring 1 year or more after 131I treatment, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.11). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for cancers of the lung (SIR = 1.32; n = 105) and kidney (SIR = 1.39; n = 66). Among 10-year survivors, significantly elevated risks were seen for cancers of the stomach (SIR = 1.33; n = 58), kidney (SIR = 1.51; n = 37), and brain (SIR = 1.63; n = 30). Only the risk for stomach cancer, however, increased over time (P less than .05) and with increasing activity administered (P = not significant). The risk for malignant lymphoma was significantly below expectation (SIR = 0.53; n = 11). Overall cancer risk did not increase with administered 131I dose or with time since exposure. The absence of any increase in leukemia adds further support to the view that a radiation dose delivered gradually over time is less carcinogenic than the same total dose received over a short time. Only for stomach cancer was a possible radiogenic excess suggested. 
Recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. Although most circulating T cells in normal subjects express both CD3 and CD5 antigens on the cell surface, a small number lack the CD5 antigen. Recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants develop increased numbers of CD3+ CD5- cells, particularly those who develop graft versus host disease (GVHD). This CD3+ CD5- population may rise transiently in patients who have received an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in patients following completion of intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These findings suggest that these CD3+ CD5- cells are a normal component of the regenerating lymphoid system after BMT or chemotherapy. 
Use of light reflection rheography for diagnosis of axillary or subclavian venous thrombosis. Noninvasive diagnosis of axillary and subclavian venous thrombosis or documentation of the post-thrombotic syndrome using modalities currently in use is not definitive. Light reflection rheography, which is a reflection of venous pressure changes in the extremity as recorded from the subdermal capillary plexus, was used to correctly diagnose axillary or subclavian venous thrombosis in 11 patients. A positive study was confirmed by phlebography in each instance. There were no instances of false-positive results. The methodology is simple, involving testing of the venous outflow from the upper extremity in response to exercise, application of venous congesting pressure, and measurement of the rate of venous outflow when the congesting pressure is released. Normal respiratory variations of an open venous system are also assessed by this noninvasive modality. The tracing obtained is easy to interpret and provides objective evidence of proximal venous occlusion. The test is not operator-dependent and the instrumentation is relatively inexpensive. We believe that light reflection rheography may be an exciting development in the noninvasive diagnosis of axillary or subclavian venous compromise and merits further trials. 
Congenital optic tract syndrome. We describe two patients with complete homonymous hemianopia who were unaware of their visual field defects. The clinical impression of an optic tract syndrome was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed absence of the corresponding tract in each case. The pathogenesis of congenital absence of the optic tract is unclear but it could represent either a primary failure of development or secondary atrophy due to focal injury during the perinatal period. 
Diagnostic implications of spectral and temporal analysis of the entire cardiac cycle in patients with ventricular tachycardia BACKGROUND. Available methods for analysis of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) have a low-positive predictive accuracy for identifying patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Identification of the spectral and temporal features in ECGs that distinguish patients prone to ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a prerequisite to implementing refinements in methods that increase the diagnostic power of the signal-averaged ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fast Fourier transforms and time-domain reconstructions based on inverse fast Fourier transforms were computed over the entire cardiac cycle of signal-averaged ECGs of sinus beats from 40 patients with myocardial infarction and sustained VT, 41 with infarction without VT, and 20 normal controls. Ventricular depolarization and repolarization were analyzed by procedures that obviate limited resolution due to short data segments and window functions. Spectral magnitudes of ECGs from patients in each group were compared, and the phase data were used for time-domain reconstructions to determine the temporal distributions of distinguishing frequency bands during the cardiac cycle. Magnitudes of 1-7-Hz frequencies were increased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001), and magnitudes of 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequencies were decreased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001) in the spectra of ECGs from patients with VT compared with patients without VT. Time-domain reconstructions demonstrated that 1-7-Hz frequencies were detectable throughout the QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave in ECGs from each group. The 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequency bands not only contributed to the terminal QRS and ST segment but were also detectable throughout the QRS complex of ECGs from patients with VT. CONCLUSIONS. Results define new spectral and temporal features in signal-averaged ECGs from patients with VT that are excluded from analysis by available techniques that limit the bandwidth or restrict interrogation to portions of the cardiac cycle. These findings provide an objective basis for developing new indexes for signal-averaged ECG analysis. 
Effect of theophylline on sleep and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To investigate the effect of theophylline on sleep and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we studied 12 male nonhypercapnic subjects with a mean +/- SEM age of 62.8 +/- 2.5 yr and a FEV1 of 1.36 +/- 0.11 L using a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. Sustained-action theophylline (250 mg three times or four times a day) or placebo was administered for 2 days, and the alternate drug was administered on the following 2 days. Sleep studies were performed on Nights 2 and 4 with spirometry at 9:00P.M. and 7:00A.M. Two puffs of metaproterenol or albuterol were administered at 10:00P.M. on both study nights. A theophylline level, drawn at bedtime (10:00 to 11:00P.M.), was 14.2 +/- 0.78 micrograms/ml on the theophylline nights and less than 2 on placebo nights. The morning FEV1 was significantly better during theophylline administration (1.27 +/- 0.12 versus 1.00 +/- 0.11 L, p less than 0.001). The mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) were also better during NREM sleep on theophylline nights. Neither the mean SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2 during REM sleep nor the apnea plus hypopnea index (events per hour of sleep) differed between placebo and theophylline nights. Theophylline administration did not impair the amount or architecture of sleep as neither total sleep time nor the fraction of time spent in Stages 1, 2, and 3/4 and REM differed between the two regimens. The number of arousals per hour of sleep was slightly less on theophylline nights (19.9 +/- 1.7 versus 24.9 +/- 2.7, p less than 0.05). 
Psychiatric illness and irritable bowel syndrome: a comparison with inflammatory bowel disease Structured psychiatric interviews and psychological self-report measures were administered to 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 19 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Significantly more of the patients with irritable bowel syndrome had lifetime diagnoses of major depression, somatization disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobic disorder. They had significantly more medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and most had suffered from psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, before the onset of their irritable bowel symptoms. 
Persistent extrapyramidal syndrome with dystonia and rigidity caused by combined metoclopramide and prochlorperazine therapy. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who experienced a persistent, generalized syndrome of dystonia and rigidity (tardive dystonia-parkinsonism) while being treated for vomiting with metoclopramide in combination with prochlorperazine. This syndrome was more severe than is typically seen in drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes and may have contributed to her death. The extreme severity of this disorder was probably related to the use of a combination of dopamine antagonists in a patient who had premorbid cerebral dysfunction. Although dopamine antagonists should always be used with caution in individuals with cerebral dysfunction, this particular combination of antiemetics should probably be avoided in such patients. 
Coronary angiography after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. PURPOSE: To review the status of emergency, urgent, routine, and selective angiography after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published from January 1985 to July 1990 were identified through MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: For emergency angiography, four major randomized studies were reviewed and data from nine studies that incorporated rescue coronary angioplasty were pooled for meta-analysis. For urgent angiography, two controlled trials were reviewed. Comparisons of routine and selective angiography were done using data from two dedicated, large-scale, controlled trials and the ancillary findings of four other studies of reperfusion that incorporated angiography. DATA EXTRACTION: The review emphasizes the findings from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Emergency coronary angiography is done primarily in preparation for primary or rescue angioplasty; the value of rescue angioplasty has yet to be assessed in a randomized trial, but technical success and reocclusion improve significantly after therapy with nonspecific plasminogen activators compared with relatively specific agents (success rate, 86% compared with 75%, respectively; P = 0.03; reocclusion rate, 10.9% compared with 26.8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urgent coronary angiography has value for treating recurrent ischemia, but patients who develop this complication after thrombolysis are likely to have a suboptimal outcome despite aggressive care. Studies support the use of either selective or routine angiography in uncomplicated patients after thrombolytic therapy; either approach is acceptable, but the former is more practical and may prove to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal follow-up for patients with evolving myocardial infarction who receive thrombolysis may incorporate coronary angiography at various stages. Although our ability to noninvasively detect reperfusion, reocclusion, or viable but ischemic myocardium is limited at present, available data may assist in selecting a catheterization strategy. 
Cerebral ischemic events associated with endocarditis, retinal vascular disease, and lupus anticoagulant. PURPOSE: A group of young patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events, endocardial lesions, and lupus anticoagulant is described in order to highlight the common clinical laboratory features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (10 females, age range 17 to 53 years [mean 38 years]) at onset of symptoms of cerebral ischemia who had evidence of the lupus anticoagulant syndrome and were being followed prospectively are reviewed. All patients had abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation test results, and most had anticardiolipin antibody at the time of presentation. Three of 14 had four or more American Rheumatism Association criteria for definite systemic lupus erythematosus and the remaining patients were considered to have primary lupus anticoagulant syndrome. RESULTS: The common features among these patients included at least one cerebral ischemic event at presentation (stroke or transient ischemic attack), or recurrent episodes suggesting cerebral ischemia (amaurosis fugax, recurrent severe migraine headaches), livedo reticularis, endocardial valvular lesions noted on echocardiography (11 mitral, two aortic valve) that were often associated with discrete vegetations, retinal vascular lesions, and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging scanning or angiographic evidence of multiple cerebral infarction. Venous thromboembolic events were uncommon (three of 14). Common laboratory studies included thrombocytopenia (10 of 14), positive direct Coombs' test result (11 of 14), and hypocomplementemia (11 of 14). Follow-up after initial treatment with either salicylates or anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for up to 10 years indicated that while many patients had recurrent symptoms suggesting cerebral ischemia, major stroke syndromes did not recur nor new episodes emerge. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple cerebral ischemic lesions and endocardial lesions, including valvular vegetations, suggests that these cerebral ischemic events represent cerebral emboli, and that these cerebral embolic events originate from vegetative lesions on the mitral or, less commonly, aortic valve, in association with lupus anticoagulant. 
Nonsurgical treatment of drooling in a patient with closed head injury and severe dysarthria. The purpose of this investigation was to measure the effectiveness of the antimuscarinic drug atropine sulfate in the treatment of chronic drooling in a patient with a history of severe closed head injury and resultant widespread oral neuromuscular and higher cortical disturbances. Results of the A-B-A-B-A-B withdrawal paradigm, chosen to demonstrate the functional relationship between drug therapy and the degree of drooling, revealed that administration of atropine sulfate reduced by more than 50% of baseline levels the amount of resting secretion, intraoral accumulation, and pharyngeal-laryngeal pooling of saliva, with negligible side effects. These results are discussed and compared to the alternative drug and surgical approaches to treatment that have been the primary focus of recent research on drooling. 
Cardiac reperfusion damage prevented by a nitroxide free radical. Experimental evidence is presented that directly links ischemia/reperfusion injury to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO)--a stable nitroxide radical that disproportionates superoxide radicals and oxidizes reduced metal ions required for OH. formation--was tested for its ability to prevent reperfusion damage in the isolated rat heart subjected to regional ischemia. Severe reperfusion arrhythmia--ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia--were prominent in control hearts, and their duration was significantly reduced by the presence of 0.4 or 1 mM TEMPO. TEMPO also repressed both postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase and OH. formation. TEMPO slowed the heart rate, but compensatory pacing did not alter the dramatic effect of the nitroxide on reperfusion arrhythmia. TEMPO was partially protective when introduced at the end of ischemia but had no effect when added 1 min into reperfusion. It was concluded that both reperfusion arrhythmia and cell damage were directly related to oxidative damage incurred during the critical first minute of reperfusion. TEMPO strongly protected against reperfusion injury by preventing the formation of OH. and not by decreasing heart rate or by direct suppression of arrhythmia. 
The role of endogenous opiates in athletic amenorrhea. We hypothesized that menstrual disturbances in female athletes arise from opioid-induced abnormalities in gonadotropin and/or prolactin (PRL) secretion. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and PRL levels in eumenorrheic and amenorrheic athletes during thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone tests at baseline, after naloxone infusions, after exercise to exhaustion, and after similar exercise during naloxone infusions. Contrary to our hypothesis, amenorrheic runners did not have significant alterations in basal, postexercise, or stimulated hormone levels compared with eumenorrheic runners. In addition, opioid blockade by naloxone did not enhance gonadotropin release by amenorrheic athletes. 
Pentamorphone for management of postoperative pain. The efficacy, duration, and safety of the synthetic opioid pentamorphone in the treatment of acute postoperative pain were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 72 patients given 0.08, 0.16, or 0.24 micrograms/kg of pentamorphone or a placebo intravenously in the recovery room after major abdominal or orthopedic surgery. Only patients given 0.24 micrograms/kg of pentamorphone experienced decreased pain intensity and increased sedation, both transient in duration. Although the two higher doses of pentamorphone delayed the patient's request for supplemental morphine, the total amount of morphine required within the first hour was not different between treatments. No acute cardiorespiratory changes were observed. Pentamorphone (0.08-0.24 micrograms/kg) was ineffective for treating acute postoperative pain after major surgery. 
Bilateral vestibular paresis: diagnosis and treatment. Patients with bilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction present a substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the otologist. Caloric irrigations that suggest bilateral weakness may mislead the clinician when considerable peripheral function remains. Rotary chair testing at several frequencies is helpful in confirming the degree of residual function and may identify patients who have a better prognosis in rehabilitation. Forty-nine patients with bilateral vestibular paresis were evaluated. The diagnosis was based on caloric responses of less than 5 degrees/sec in both ears and reduced gain on rotary chair trials. Oscillopsia occurred in the minority of patients (35%) and was rare unless severe paresis was present. Episodic vertigo occurred in 43%. All patients had abnormal posturography results, with vestibular dysfunction and severe dysfunction patterns predominating. The treatment outcomes of 22 patients who underwent vestibular rehabilitation are discussed. Prevention of bilateral vestibular paresis remains a high priority. 
A clinical and experimental study on all-trans retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Fifty patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). In vitro induced differentiation of primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the patients, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and L-CFU colony-forming assays, and karyotype analysis were performed over the treatment course. The very high bone marrow complete remission (CR) rate (94%) suggested that all-trans RA was superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of APL. The leukemic clone was reduced by RA-induced terminal differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity of leukemic cells. Relapse after CR in about 40% of patients was the major reason for the failure of the RA treatment. Patients who relapsed after a chemotherapy-maintained CR could be effectively reinduced to second CR by RA. However, if relapse occurred after a CR maintained by both RA and chemotherapy, the sensitivity of newly emerged leukemic clones to RA was greatly reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that RA should be replaced by conventional chemotherapy as soon as CR is achieved. Laboratory studies proved valuable in selecting cases for RA therapy and in predicting therapeutic effects and prognosis. 
Carcinomas with metaplasia and sarcomas of the breast. The clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric characteristics of 34 cases of mammary carcinoma with metaplasia were compared with those of 20 cases of pure sarcoma of the breast. All 20 of the latter tumors showed the pattern of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. There were 20 cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia, 7 cases of carcinoma with mixed epithelial (squamous) and mesenchymal metaplasia, and 7 cases of carcinoma with epithelial metaplasia (four mixed ductal/squamous and three pure squamous cell carcinomas). No patient with pure sarcoma had lymph node metastases develop; all nodal metastases were found in patients who had carcinoma with metaplasia, although in one case the carcinomatous component was seen only within a lymph node metastasis. Epithelial antigens were found not only within the epithelial elements of all cases of carcinoma, but also within the apparent mesenchymal elements of 44% of the carcinomas showing divergent differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of eight cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia showed aneuploidy/tetraploidy in six neoplasms. For patient management purposes, the distinction of pure sarcoma from carcinoma with metaplasia is important, but additional subclassification of carcinoma with metaplasia is of greater biologic than clinical interest. 
Granulocytic sarcoma of the ovary. An unusual case presentation. We report an unusual occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an ovarian mass in a 46-year-old woman with a history of dysplastic nevus syndrome. During workup of the ovarian mass, the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was made. A fine-needle aspirate of the ovarian mass showed granulocytic sarcoma. The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later. A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma. Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy. Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology. The association between dysplastic nevus syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in this case is discussed with reference to a review of the metachronous association between melanoma and leukemia as described in the literature. 
Oral leukoplakia and adolescent smokeless tobacco use. The recent increase in smokeless tobacco (ST) use has prompted investigators to assess the health effects of ST use. This study attempted to evaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia among adolescent users and to determine factors associated with its presence. During their annual physical examination, 1116 teenaged football players (567 black, 546 white) answered a 34-question survey and received an oral screening examination. Results indicated that 0.5% of nonusers, 1.5% of previous users, and 13% of current users had clinically evident oral leukoplakia. Factors statistically associated with higher leukoplakia rates included history of ST use, regular ST use, years of ST use, and the weekly quantity consumed. Factors not associated included use of alcohol, use of cigarettes, type of ST used, and hours of ST use. One brand of snuff was found to be associated with a relative risk of leukoplakia higher than that of another brand of snuff. Overall, in ST users oral leukoplakia was six times more likely to develop than in nonusers. Earlier ages of ST use may lead to greater periods of use (in years) and to possible increases in deleterious long-term health effects in current adolescents. 
Enteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention. 
Feeding regimens after pyloromyotomy. In a prospective randomized study three different feeding regimens after operation were compared in 74 babies with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: gradual regarding of feeds over 48 h (regimen 1), rapid regarding of feeds over 16 h (regimen 2), and initial starvation followed by full normal feeds at 24 h (regimen 3). No significant difference between the treatment groups was found either in episodes of vomiting after operation (regimen 1, 2.9 episodes in 21 patients; regimen 2, 3.6 episodes in 28 patients; regimen 3, 3.6 episodes in 25 patients) or in the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay (regimen 1, 59.3 h; regimen 2, 47.8 h; regimen 3, 56.7 h). We conclude that vomiting following pyloromyotomy is self-limiting and independent of the timetable or composition of the postoperative dietary regimen. 
Evaluation of the effect of perineuronal morphine on the quality of postoperative analgesia after axillary plexus block: a randomized double-blind study. A randomized, double-blind study was performed on 50 patients scheduled for elective hand and forearm surgery under axillary plexus block to evaluate the effect of perineuronal morphine on the quality of postoperative analgesia. Patients were divided into two groups. In group A (n = 25) 5 mg of preservative-free morphine in 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline was added to the local anesthetic solution (20 mL of 1% plain lignocaine, 20 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine). They also received an intramuscular placebo injection of 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline in the upper thigh. In group B (n = 25), 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline was added to the local anesthetic solution and patients received an intramuscular injection of 5 mg of preservative-free morphine in 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline in the thigh. The addition of morphine to the local anesthetic solution for the axillary block did not shorten the onset time of the block, improve the quality of postoperative pain relief, or provide longer lasting analgesia than that obtained with intramuscular morphine. 
Vascular renin-angiotensin system and neurotransmission in hypertensive persons. The existence of a vascular renin-angiotensin system and its role in modulating sympathetic activity were evaluated in forearm arterioles of hypertensive individuals. Isoproterenol (0.03, 0.01, 0.3 microgram/100 ml/min for 5 minutes each; n = 5) was infused into the brachial artery, and active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine forearm balance (venous-arterial differences corrected for forearm blood flow by strain-gauge plethysmography) were measured. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation and a dose-dependent active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine outflow, an effect blunted by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml/min). To evaluate the role of local angiotensin II on beta-mediated norepinephrine overflow, the experiment was repeated with captopril (2.5 micrograms/100 ml/min for 10 minutes; n = 5), which abolished angiotensin II release and significantly reduced norepinephrine overflow. To test whether angiotensin II facilitates both prejunctional norepinephrine release and its postjunctional action, we evaluated the effect of exogenous angiotensin II, infused into the brachial artery at low concentrations (0.001 microgram/100 ml/min), on forearm vasoconstriction and norepinephrine release induced by endogenous sympathetic activation (application of a lower body negative pressure: -10 and -20 mm Hg for 5 minutes, n = 10) and on the vasoconstrictor effect of local norepinephrine (0.0015, 0.005, 0.015, 0.05, 0.15 micrograms/100 ml/min for 3 minutes each; n = 6). Although angiotensin II increased the vasoconstricting effect and the norepinephrine release induced by lower body negative pressure, it failed to affect norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Our data indicate the existence in hypertensive individuals of a vascular renin-angiotensin system that seems to modulate sympathetic activity through the presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release. 
Impaired lipopolysaccharide-inducible tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes of patients with viral hepatitis. We investigated lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes from patients with various liver diseases. Tumor necrosis factor production was found to be significantly reduced in patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 17; 135 +/- 30 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; mean +/- S.E.M.) and patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 15; 212 +/- 22 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) compared with healthy control individuals (n = 47; 411 +/- 40 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively). This reduced tumor necrosis factor production was not only seen with an optimal stimulating concentration of lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) but also with suboptimal concentrations (0.1 ng/ml). In contrast to patients with chronic viral hepatitis, monocytes from patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis (n = 26; 444 +/- 49 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 7; 412 +/- 81 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) and alcohol-induced fatty liver changes (n = 5; 401 +/- 62 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) produced normal amounts of tumor necrosis factor when stimulated with an optimal concentration of lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide (0.1 ng lipopolysaccharide/ml)-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 15; 102 +/- 32 pg/ml) or non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 13; 97+/- 16 pg/ml) could not be induced to produce more tumor necrosis factor either when prestimulated with gamma-interferon (170 +/- 45 pg/ml and 149 +/- 32 pg/ml, respectively), a lymphokine known to activate monocytes, or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to reduce the suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 (148 +/- 40 pg/ml and 153 +/- 45 pg/ml, respectively. 
The burden of acute respiratory infection due to measles in developing countries and the potential impact of measles vaccine. Measles is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in developing countries. Hospital and community-based studies of ALRI have found that measles accounts for 6%-21% of the morbidity and 8%-93% of the mortality due to ALRI. Although live attenuated measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines in use today, measles has not been controlled in many parts of the world, primarily because the levels of vaccine coverage required to interrupt measles transmission have not been achieved. In addition, in some areas, a large percentage of cases of measles occur in infants who are younger than the age recommended for vaccination. Recent studies suggest that the Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine may be more immunogenic than other vaccine strains in young infants. A substantial proportion of ALRI could be prevented by increasing measles vaccine coverage and by the use of particular vaccine strains in younger children. 
Adrenal and ovarian steroid hormone responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment in polycystic ovary syndrome. It has been postulated that in polycystic ovary syndrome ovarian steroids can influence adrenal steroidogenesis. To test this hypothesis, basal and dexamethasone-suppressed-corticotropin-stimulated steroid hormone responses were compared among three groups of women before, during, and after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment for 3 months. The groups were characterized as follows: (1) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (greater than 400 micrograms/dl), (2) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (less than 300 micrograms/dl), and (3) normal ovulatory women. In response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, basal serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, estrone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone in all three groups were suppressed to similar levels. Basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in the group with high levels declined, but they did not reach the normal, unaltered concentrations in the other two groups. Two subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome in this group with high levels, who showed the greatest declines in basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (34%, 40%), also had evidence of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency before treatment, which was resolved by the end of treatment. In both groups with polycystic ovary syndrome, the increase in maximum incremental rise of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in response to a pharmacologic dose of corticotropin from a dexamethasone-suppressed baseline (adrenal androgen capacity) remained unaltered during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration. We conclude that ovarian steroids may promote excessive adrenal androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, may induce 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency as a mechanism for adrenal involvement in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and do not influence adrenal androgen capacity. 
Responsiveness of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma to tamoxifen. A Gynecologic Oncology Group study of second-line therapy in 105 patients. One hundred five patients with Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer whose disease had persisted or recurred after primary surgery and first-line chemotherapy were given tamoxifen (20 mg orally twice daily) and evaluated for response. Eighteen percent of the patients responded: 10% demonstrated a complete response (CR) and 8% showed a partial response (PR). Thirty-eight percent of the patients had short-term disease stabilization. CR had a median duration of 7.5 months, with the longest lasting 17 months. For patients with PR or stable disease, the median duration of response was 3 months (maximum duration, 9 months). When estrogen receptors of tumor tissue from patients demonstrating CR were evaluated, eight of nine (89%) had elevated estrogen receptor levels. This contrasts with patients who had stable or progressive disease as only 59% of them had measurable estrogen receptors (P = 0.16). 
Mucosal IgA recognition of Helicobacter pylori 120 kDa protein, peptic ulceration, and gastric pathology. The gastric IgA response to Helicobacter pylori was examined in 100 dyspeptic patients by means of immunoblotting of supernatants from antral biopsy and gastric mononuclear cell cultures. 76 of 78 patients with chronic gastritis, 2 of 8 with reactive gastritis, and 1 of 14 subjects with normal mucosa showed positive responses. Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori. 
Meniscal tears: MR and arthrographic findings after arthroscopic repair. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on 29 previously repaired menisci and one conservatively treated meniscus (total, 30 menisci). Intermediate- and T1-weighted MR sequences revealed persistent signal intensity extending to an articular surface (grade 3 signal intensity) in 27 of the 30 menisci. On T2-weighted images, seven of the 30 menisci were found to contain unequivocally higher signal intensity, defined by a full-thickness defect (grade 3 signal intensity involving two articular surfaces) increasing in signal intensity to a level equivalent to that of joint fluid. The MR imaging and arthrographic appearances of 23 of the 30 menisci were compared. Arthrographic examination revealed partial or complete healing in 13 menisci and tears in 10. The presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted MR images did not reliably predict a tear seen at arthrography. Unequivocally higher signal intensity on T2-weighted images is a useful sign in the prediction of a persistent meniscal tear (sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 92%; P less than .02). Since presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted images does not reliably predict a tear and unequivocal T2 increase in intensity has a sensitivity of only 60%, arthrography should be considered for assessment of the symptomatic, previously repaired meniscus. 
Reduced vascular compliance as a marker for essential hypertension. In 38 patients with established essential hypertension and 32 age-matched normotensive control subjects proximal and distal arterial compliance were determined by computer-based assessment of the diastolic decay of a brachial arterial tracing and a modified Windkessel model of the circulation. In the hypertensive subjects compared to the normotensive subjects mean arterial pressure was 25% higher (P less than .001), systemic vascular resistance 23% higher (P less than .01), proximal compliance 19% lower (P less than .01), and distal compliance 72% lower (P less than .001). The reduction in distal compliance was highly age-dependent. In the youngest age range (45 to 54 years) little overlap appeared between hypertensive and normotensive groups, whereas in the oldest subjects studied (65 to 75 years) distal compliance was comparably low in the two groups. Thus, distal vascular compliance provides a sensitive and specific marker for the abnormal vasculature associated with hypertension and may be particularly useful in identifying the disease in young individuals with borderline blood pressure. 
Intestinal injury after lumbar discectomy. In a review of 5,200 lumbar discectomies performed from 1974 to 1989, two patients sustained a ventral perforation of the disc space followed by isolated small intestinal injury. Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation. At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily. The patients had an uneventful recovery. The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine. Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury. After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections. Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration. A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication. 
Primary CNS lymphoma treated with osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption: prolonged survival and preservation of cognitive function. Combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy has had only modest efficacy in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma. Median survival of these patients, treated primarily with radiotherapy, is 13 months; 5-year survival is less than 5%. Thirty consecutive non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with primary CNS lymphoma were treated with barrier-dependent chemotherapy using intraarterial mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Follow-up included extensive neuropsychologic testing of all patients. Thirteen patients received cranial radiation 1 to 9 months before referral (group 1). Seventeen patients received initial BBB disruption chemotherapy with subsequent radiation only for tumor progression or recurrence (group 2). The difference in median survivals from diagnosis--17.8 months for group 1 and 44.5 months for group 2--was statistically significant (P = .039). Group 1 survival is comparable with the 20-month median survival of a historical series of patients (n = 208) treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Group 2 patient survival represents an advance in the survival of CNS lymphoma and was associated with preservation of cognitive function in six of seven nonirradiated complete responders observed for 1 to 7 years. Patient toxicity was manageable in this intensive therapeutic regimen. In this series, a plateau in survival curves suggests that a major portion of these patients may be cured without the neuropsychologic sequelae associated with cranial radiation. 
Modulation of neuropathic pain behavior in rats by spinal disinhibition and NMDA receptor blockade of injury discharge. When a peripheral nerve is severed, damaged sensory fibers emit a barrage of impulses that lasts for many seconds, or even several minutes ('injury discharge'). We have shown in rats that local anesthetic blockade of this discharge suppresses autotomy (a behavioral model of neuropathic pain). Correspondingly, mimicking prolonged injury discharge with electrical stimulation, especially of C-fibers, increased autotomy. These data support the hypothesis that injury discharge plays a role in the triggering of neuropathic pain. The mechanism of triggering autotomy was investigated using intrathecal injection of agents affecting glutamatergic transmission. A single intrathecal injection at the lumbar enlargement of the NMDA receptor blockers MK-801 and 5-APV, just prior to neurectomy, significantly suppressed autotomy. Blocking glycinergic inhibition just prior to neurectomy with a single strychnine injection strikingly enhanced autotomy. Strychnine enhancement of autotomy was prevented by prior injection of MK-801 or 5-APV. These results suggest that the expression of autotomy in rats, and by inference neuropathic pain in humans, is affected by injury discharge, possibly mediated by long-lasting, NMDA receptor-related, spinal disinhibition. 
Plasmapheresis. A therapeutic option in the management of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HATT) is an uncommon syndrome that is estimated to occur in 1-5% of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Early diagnosis requires careful clinical surveillance, and the management of these patients can be complex. Cessation of heparin therapy and substitution or addition of oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, dextrans, and prostacyclin analogues have been advocated. The authors are aware of only two case reports in the literature that examine the use of plasmapheresis as a therapeutic alternative. The authors report a case of a 53-year-old white man who developed HATT after a single protamine-reversed exposure to heparin. Controlled platelet aggregation studies performed before and after apheresis sessions documented a dramatic response and rapid normalization of platelet number and function in the patient. The authors conclude that plasmapheresis could be a valuable adjunct in the successful management of patients with HATT. When done in conjunction with platelet aggregation studies, an objective measurement of therapeutic efficacy can be achieved. 
Interleukin-2 induces early multisystem organ edema mediated by neutrophils. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an agent known to activate neutrophils (PMN) with thromboxane (Tx)B2 release, produces pulmonary edema within 6 hours of intravenous infusion. This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema. Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour. At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05). After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05). There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney. Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
Nutritional support in the critically ill surgical patient. Aggressive nutritional support in the critically ill surgical patient is essential if improved outcome is to be realized. An understanding of the metabolic alterations of trauma and sepsis provides the foundation for a nutritional prescription for the individual patient. Careful nutritional assessment; titration of fluid, electrolytes, and micronutrients; provision of adequate calories and nitrogen to meet metabolic needs; and the selective use of specialized formulations are important components of nutritional management in the ICU. 
Patellofemoral pain. An arthroscopic perspective. Patellofemoral pain should be approached as thoroughly as any other musculoskeletal disease. A careful patient history and physical examination are mandatory. These are followed by appropriate imaging studies such as radiographs, bone scans, CT scans, CT arthrograms, and MRI, as each individual case demands. Finally, arthroscopy is employed in its proper sequence. This article has been developed as an attempt to define a classification scheme of anterior knee pain and then to narrow this down to pain localized to the patellofemoral joint. The authors have attempted to isolate further the clinical entities to those that can be diagnosed and treated arthroscopically. Arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery allow recognition and treatment of these disorders with minimal invasiveness and patient morbidity. 
The elusive cause of instability in unstable angina. The causes of unstable angina are still largely unknown. However, some facts deriving from angiographic, postmortem, and pathophysiologic studies are well established. Angiographic findings: coronary thrombi and complicated stenoses are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina. Conversely, the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the development of collateral circulation is similar in both coronary syndromes. Postmortem findings: the following features are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina: (1) mural thrombi, which often represent out-growth from the inside of a fissured plaque; (2) inflammatory cells at the site of plaques and in perivascular nerves; and (3) contraction bands in smooth muscle cells of the media surrounding plaques. However, fissured plaques can be found in 10% of individuals dying of noncardiac causes, and fissured plaque may occasionally be missing under the coronary thrombus in unstable angina. Pathophysiologic findings: patients with unstable angina compared with those with stable angina exhibit: (1) higher levels of serotonin in the coronary sinus; (2) higher systemic levels of fibrino-peptide A; (3) higher urinary levels of thromboxane A2 metabolites; and (4) a greater coronary reactivity to constrictor stimuli. A critical analysis of these established facts is required to set the stage for a better comprehension of the causes which can cause a coronary segment to progress in a stuttering way toward acute persistent coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction. Plaque fissure is likely to be an important background thrombogenic stimulus in many cases. 
Antitumor effect of synthetic derivatives of lipid A in an experimental model of colon cancer in the rat. Colon carcinoma is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in industrialized countries. The patients generally die of the metastases. In a colon cancer rat model, the authors have shown that lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli induced the regression of carcinomatosis and cured 20%-30% of the rats. Some synthetic derivatives of lipid A, which are less toxic than lipopolysaccharides, were injected 14 days after the tumor cells. They induced the complete regression of peritoneal carcinomatosis consisting of numerous nodules measuring 1-5 mm in 20%-30% of rats. Only compounds with three or more hydroxymyristic acid residues were effective. In vivo effects were correlated with the capacity to induce the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but not with the capacity to induce macrophage-mediated cytolysis. It is therefore possible to synthesize weakly toxic derivatives of lipopolysaccharides retaining their antitumoral property in vivo. 
Diurnal variation of essential and physiological tremor. Evaluations were made of the diurnal variations of tremor power at rest, after fatigue and after mass loading, and plasma norepinephrine in patients with familial essential tremor and normal subjects. Diurnal tremor power rhythms for both essential and physiological tremor pursued identical temporal profiles. Plasma norepinephrine levels followed a congruent diurnal pattern with later peak values than the peak values of tremor power. Sympathetic nervous system activity is unlikely to be the cause of diurnal tremor power variation. The consistent diurnal rhythm of tremor power may affect dosage schemes of tremorolytic drugs. 
Measurement of in vivo urological tumour cell kinetics using multiparameter flow cytometry. Preliminary study. The in vivo labelling of urological tumour cells using the S phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) for histochemical studies is reported. The use of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) with BRdU labelling to study tumour proliferation offers significant advantages. It provides simultaneous measurements of the DNA ploidy (DI), the duration of the S phase (Ts), the potential doubling time (Tpot) and the total and aneuploid tumour labelling indices (LI) from a single specimen. Heterogenous tumour cell populations can be measured with high sensitivity. We report a preliminary study to evaluate the method in the measurement of the kinetics of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB). Nineteen patients with TCCB, 1 with leukoplakia of the bladder, 2 with renal carcinoma, 1 with prostatic carcinoma and 1 with a squamous carcinoma of the penis were studied. Of the bladder tumours, 3 were aneuploid, DI = 1.32, 1.58 and 1.89. BRdU uptake was detected in all tumours. The median LI was 1.5% (range 0.5-10.0). In 15/19 tumours the labelling profile was satisfactory for calculation of the Ts and Tpot. The median Ts was 6.2 h and the median Tpot was 17.1 days. This study demonstrates that measurement of multiple parameters of urological tumour proliferation in vivo is possible. These parameters require further assessment as indices of biological aggressiveness and clinical prognosis. 
Effects of heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure on Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time in experimental acute pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary hypertension in humans is characterized by shortening of the pulmonary artery acceleration time as measured by Doppler echocardiography, such that the higher the pulmonary artery pressure, the shorter the pulmonary acceleration time. Increases in heart rate are also known to produce decreases in the pulmonary artery acceleration time. To explore the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, and Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time, experimental acute pulmonary hypertension was created in nine Duroc swine, either by infusion of Sephadex beads with embolization of the pulmonary arterial circulation or by partially occluding the main pulmonary artery 8 to 10 cm distal to the pulmonic valve. Pulmonary artery Doppler flow velocity recordings and invasive pressure measurements were made at baseline and at paced atrial rates ranging from 60 to 160 beats per minute, in 20-beat increments. The results in this acute animal model reveal that increases in heart rate produced significant decreases in Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time at mean pressures below 25 mm Hg. However, with mean pulmonary artery pressures greater than 25 mm Hg, both heart rate and increases in pulmonary artery pressure had no significant effect on acceleration time. 
Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes. Appropriate management of the patient with transient focal neurological symptoms must start with accurate clinical diagnosis. Wider use of clear diagnostic criteria and symptom checklists, and better knowledge of the clinical features of the 'funny turns' which are not related to transient focal cerebral ischaemia could reduce the present variability in clinical diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks. More accurate clinical diagnosis contributes to better selection of the most appropriate investigation strategy for each patient. A basic minimum standard of investigation is outlined and perhaps provides a suitable template for audit. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks which are definitely in the carotid distribution may be eligible for entry in trials of carotid endarterectomy. Prudent use of duplex ultrasound studies of the carotid arteries in patients with appropriate symptoms is an effective way to reduce the costs of investigations and their complications (i.e. the number of strokes associated with cerebral angiography). Digital venous subtraction angiography has, by comparison, many disadvantages as a screening tool. Advances in management include: recent statistical overviews which have emphasized the need to consider blood pressure and plasma cholesterol reduction in a large proportion of patients, and the value of long term anti-platelet therapy in reducing the risks of stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in both males and females. The value of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke is being tested in current trials. 
Total knee arthroplasty at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was evaluated in 256 consecutive knees in a Veterans Administration hospital. Patient satisfaction and the effect of intercurrent illness were studied in addition to standard clinical and roentgenographic parameters. Evaluation of results show the superiority of condylar knee designs. In general, TKA was successful with a high degree of patient satisfaction. 
Molecular mechanisms of tubulointerstitial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Adult kidneys, which are principally composed of tubulointerstitium, do not normally regenerate or expand their working pool of functional cells at a very high rate. Loss of kidney tissue, however, can lead to some compensatory renal enlargement. The catalytic forces initiating such exchanges have not been fully articulated by current experimental endeavors. Increasing evidence, nevertheless, does suggest that factors other than simple changes in renal hemodynamics may be involved in this process. Different cellular elements in the tubulointerstitial microenvironment probably modulate changes in tubular enlargement or size through a complex cytokine network. Autocrine and paracrine stimulation of enlargement by different local growth factors also seem to play a pivotal role. After binding to cellular receptors, these factors activate signal transduction pathways resulting in expression of immediate early genes, which by themselves can synchronize the expression of subsequent genes through the medium of transacting factors. The renal enlargement response can also be modified by endocrine hormones that can activate such genes directly and/or stimulate other adjunctive processes, like receptor expression for the regional binding of growth factors. Furthermore, renal enlargement is under negative feedback of inhibitory factors like TGF beta. It is possible, for example, that special genes exist which are only expressed to arrest enlargement. It has been further suggested that activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter is a common denominator in renal enlargement. Recent findings, however, indicate that the activation of this antiporter is not always necessary, and might rather be a parallel event rather than a key phenomena in tubular enlargement. G0/G1 transition of tubular cells seems to involve similar factors in tubular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The factors which are responsible for the final determination of the enlargement pattern (hypertrophy vs. proliferation) are unknown. The separation between hypertrophy and hyperplasia, although suggested by striking differences in cellular regulation, may be somewhat artificial, since responses leading to tubular enlargement also exist in circumstances where hyperplasia and hypertrophy are combined events. Recently it has been proposed that growth factors stimulate gluconeogenesis in proximal tubular cells producing hyperplasia, whereas factors inhibiting gluconeogenesis might induce hypertrophy. Whether the common pathway message of this intriguing hypothesis is correct still requires further validation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The feeding pharyngostomy: an alternative approach to enteral feeding. We present a six-year retrospective review of feeding pharyngostomies as performed in this department. The indications, technique and complications of this procedure are discussed. 
Arteriographic findings in EDTA chelation therapy on peripheral arteriosclerosis. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study, 153 patients with claudication were each given either 20 infusions of Na2EDTA or 20 infusions of saline. Walking distances and ankle/brachial indices were measured before, during, and after treatment. In 30 patients, angiograms and transcutaneous oxygen tensions were obtained before, during, and after treatment. The patients' subjective evaluations of the effect of treatment were also recorded. It is concluded that EDTA chelation therapy has no effect in patients with intermittent claudication in the legs caused by arteriosclerosis. 
Mechanisms of hypertension in diabetes. Hypertension in insulin resistance states is generally attributed to hyperinsulinemia, with resulting increases in renal sodium retention and/or sympathetic nervous system activity. However, recent data from our laboratory suggest that cellular insulin resistance, rather than hyperinsulinemia per se, may lead to hypertension. The basic tenet proposed in this review is that the common mechanism involved in the development of hypertension in both type I and type II diabetes mellitus is a deficiency of insulin at the cellular level. Recent observations suggest that impaired cellular response to insulin predisposes to increased vascular smooth muscle (VSM) tone (the hallmark of hypertension in the diabetic state). For example, recently reported studies from our laboratory demonstrate that insulin in physiological doses attenuates the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine, serotonin, and potassium chloride. Thus, insulin appears to normally modulate (attenuate) VSM contractile responses to vasoactive factors, and insulin resistance should accordingly be associated with enhanced vascular reactivity. Abnormal VSM cell calcium [Ca2+]i homeostasis may be the nexus between insulin resistance and increased VSM tone. The genetically obese, hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant Zucker rat demonstrates increased vascular reactivity, reduced membrane Ca2(+)-ATPase activity, increased cellular Ca2+ levels, and a marked impairment in vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux compared to lean controls. Insulin stimulates membrane Ca-ATPase, blocks Ca2+ currents, and Ca2(+)-driven action potentials. Thus, an insulin-resistant state as exists in the Zucker rat may be associated with increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels and/or decreased production or activation of the VSM cell Ca-ATPase pump. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Systemic effects of collagen-impregnated aortoiliac Dacron vascular prostheses on platelet activation and fibrin formation. To minimize intraoperative blood loss a watertight knitted Dacron aortoiliac prosthesis has been developed by impregnation with bovine collagen. A potential disadvantage is that collagen may be associated with an increase in thrombus formation. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortoiliac operation as such on the coagulation mechanism during the first 10 days after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who underwent cholecystectomies served as controls. Three markers of the coagulation mechanism were monitored: beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. We found no significant differences in median beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels between patients in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis group and patients in the nonimpregnated prosthesis group. This indicates that collagen does not stimulate the coagulation cascade any more than conventional Dacron protheses do. In a comparison of patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction and patients who underwent cholecystectomies, the results indicated a significant increased platelet activation and fibrin metabolism in aortoiliac reconstruction group compared with the control group. Finally, we observed a significantly higher preoperative fibrin metabolism in patients with vascular disease than in control subjects. This difference is attributable to the high preoperative fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product values in patients with aortic aneurysms. 
Adenosine thallium 201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Pharmacologic coronary vasodilation as an adjunct to myocardial perfusion imaging has become increasingly important in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, in view of the large number of patients who cannot perform an adequate exercise test or in whom contraindications render exercise inappropriate. Adenosine is a very potent coronary vasodilator and when combined with thallium 201 scintigraphy produces images of high quality, with the added advantages of a very short half-life (less than 10 seconds) and the ability to adjust the dose during the infusion, which may enhance safety and curtail the duration of side effects. The reported sensitivity and specificity of adenosine thallium 201 scintigraphy for the detection of coronary artery disease are high and at least comparable with imaging after exercise or dipyridamole administration. 
Inhibition of the metabolism of atrial natriuretic factor causes diuresis and natriuresis in chronic heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone secreted by the heart that is degraded in vivo by endopeptidase 24:11 (atriopeptidase). UK 69,578 is a novel atriopeptidase inhibitor that raises plasma levels of ANF in animals and normal volunteers, with associated diuresis and natriuresis. This study examines the effects of UK 69,578 in patients with mild heart failure. UK 69,578 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 min in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study to six patients with stable (NYHA Class 2) chronic heart failure. The atriopeptidase inhibitor was well tolerated and no side effects were encountered. Mean baseline plasma ANF was elevated at 88 pg/mL (normal less than 50), and increased 2- to 5-fold after UK 69,578 administration. Plasma ANF did not change significantly following placebo. There was a marked diuresis after UK 69,578 compared to placebo. Urinary sodium excretion doubled for 4 to 6 h, but there was no significant rise in potassium excretion. There was no increase in plasma active renin concentration during the study period. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed no significant changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, or echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. However, invasive measurements using a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated falls in mean right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures after UK 69,578. There was no change in cardiac output. Thus, inhibition of endopeptidase 24:11 by UK 69,578 results in significant elevation of plasma ANF, with associated diuresis, natriuresis and venodilatation. The compound was well tolerated in these patients with mild chronic heart failure. 
Follicular accentuation of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in an HIV-seropositive man. Report of a case and review of the literature. Palpable purpura in a follicular localization developed in association with acute epididymitis in a white man who was seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Biopsy specimens revealed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with follicular accentuation. With antibiotic therapy the vasculitis resolved, but it recurred during repeated episodes of the epididymitis. Follicular accentuation of skin disease is often seen in HIV-seropositive patients. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a follicular localization may be the presenting skin manifestation of HIV infection. 
Clinical survey of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children in a district of Japan. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children is relatively rare. To clarify the clinical features of ischemic stroke occurring in infants and children, we evaluated 54 cases of cerebral infarction, excluding cases of moyamoya disease, in patients less than 16 years old at 24 clinics in the Tohoku (northeast) district of Japan. We observed two incidence peaks, one in little children and the other in junior high school students. Infection and minor head trauma were more frequently seen prior to ischemic strokes than was heart disease. The middle cerebral artery region, including the basal ganglia, was most commonly affected (49 patients, 91%) on computed tomograms. Angiography was performed in 48 patients (89%) and showed various types of occlusive lesions, mostly affecting the middle cerebral artery. Hemiparesis was the most common form of disability following ischemic strokes (48 patients, 89%). Surgical treatment was carried out in seven patients (13%). The clinical course of these cases showed that the recovery of children after a stroke tends to be better than that of adults, but that permanent disabilities, such as hemiparesis or mental retardation, occur commonly. Further investigation of juvenile cerebrovascular disease is important to prevent ischemic strokes in children. 
Sinus parasystole. Sinus parasystole is the expression of a protected nondominant sinus pacemaker, which is totally independent of the dominant rhythm. Two forms of sinus parasystole are described: (1) an active form, where both the dominant and the parasystolic pacemakers are located within the sinus node and (2) a passive form, where the basic rhythm is ectopic and the sinus pacemaker is protected as a result of complete retrograde SA block. Three cases of sinus parasystole are analyzed. In the active form of the arrhythmia the parasystolic sinus P waves are identical to those of the basic sinus rhythm. The diagnosis is suggested by variably coupled premature sinus P waves occurring with mathematically related intervals. This relationship between the parasystolic intervals can not be precise whenever complicating factors such as modulation occur. The recognition of active sinus parasystole is difficult, since the parasystolic P waves do not differ from basic P waves, so that the pattern resembles that of sinus arrhythmia or sinus extrasystoles. The passive form of sinus parasystole is more easily recognized due to the clear-cut difference between the dominant ectopic atrial waves and the "parasystolic" sinus P waves, which manifest with variable coupling intervals and reflect mathematically related intervals in between. 
Familial pulmonary hypertension in association with an abnormal hemoglobin. Insights into the pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension. A kindred with a familial hemoglobinopathy and familial primary pulmonary hypertension with autosomal dominant transmission has been identified. Affected family members were obvious from their cyanosis due to a reduced affinity for oxygen by the hemoglobin variant. The mother and one child had clinical pulmonary hypertension, whereas two siblings had cyanosis and preclinical pulmonary vascular disease as evidenced by abnormal perfusion lung scans and elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A in the face of normal pulmonary hemodynamics. In one, pulmonary hypertension could be induced with exercise. The studies on this family support the hypothesis that primary pulmonary hypertension may be initiated by abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular bed that predispose to in situ thrombosis. The possible common genetic transmission of the two diseases offers the speculation that the gene that confers predisposition to pulmonary hypertension may be located near the gene responsible for beta globulin. 
Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography of the temporal bone as an aid to surgical planning. Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography (3DCT) has been useful in planning surgical procedures involving craniofacial reconstruction, the pelvis, hip, spine, knee and shoulder. The clinical use of 3DCT in temporal bone surgery has not been evaluated. We used 3DCT to assess temporal bone anatomy in 9 patients. These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinflammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma. We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two-dimensional CT scanning (2DCT). While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3-D presentation of data. We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use. 
Structural alterations of microvascular smooth muscle cells in reduced renal mass hypertension. Loss of microvessels (anatomic rarefaction) occurs in chronic reduced renal mass (RRM) hypertension and is mediated via structural degeneration of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine if structural changes occur in VSM cells of the microvessels that remain in the tissue of rats with chronic RRM hypertension. Samples of cremaster muscles were taken from normotensive control rats and rats with acute (3-7 days) and chronic (14-28 days) RRM hypertension (75% reduction in kidney mass with 4% NaCl loading). The samples were fixed in situ and processed for light and electron microscopy. Ultrastructural morphology of VSM cells in terminal arterioles of control animals was normal. Although VSM morphology in many microvessels of RRM hypertensive rats was also normal, some vessels exhibited structural changes that were not present in arterioles of the normotensive animals. The most striking change was the appearance of more extensive dense bodies anchoring the contractile filaments around the outer membrane of the cells. Extreme vasoconstriction was observed in some arterioles of RRM rats as long as 2 weeks after salt loading. Focal areas of VSM cell proliferation were evident. Many of the changes occurring in RRM were detected as early as 1 week after the onset of hypertension. These observations suggest that renal mass reduction-salt loading hypertension is associated with early structural and functional changes in the VSM cells. 
Increased platelet aggregate formation in patients with chronic airflow obstruction and hypoxaemia. Platelet aggregate formation in vivo was assessed by means of the platelet aggregate ratio and from platelet release products (beta thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, thromboxane B2) in 23 patients with chronic airflow obstruction with and without hypoxaemia and in 10 control subjects without respiratory disease. Eight of the 11 hypoxaemic patients were having long term oxygen therapy. The platelet aggregate ratio was lower in the hypoxaemic patients (0.88 (SE 0.03] than in the non-hypoxaemic (0.97 (0.01] and control groups (1.00 (0.02], and there was a trend to lower aggregate ratios in the more hypoxaemic patients. Platelet release products in the peripheral venous blood were not increased in the patients or control subjects. Platelet behaviour is altered in chronic hypoxaemia and this enhanced platelet activity could contribute to the pulmonary vascular damage found in these patients through direct effects or mediator release. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
Sleep apnea in patients with acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To document sleep apnea in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. If apnea occurs in patients with myocardial infarction, hypoxemia induced by apnea might exaggerate insufficiency of oxygen supplied to the damaged myocardium. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: Critical care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients, average age 64 yrs (range 49 to 91). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient measurements were recorded on a polygraph using an apnea-monitor, pulse oximeter, pulmonary artery pressure monitor, and an ECG. All of the patients observed showed frequent apneic episodes. The apnea was especially frequent when the cardiac index was low. Capillary oxygen saturation of less than 90% (suggesting systemic hypoxia) was observed in 21 patients concomitantly with apnea. Occasionally, arrhythmias followed these episodes (premature supraventricular contractions [n = 10], premature ventricular contraction [n = 4], and ventricular tachycardia [n = 2]). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that sleep apnea is common in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. It may be a factor predisposing to, or even causing, sudden death in patients with acute phase of myocardial infarction. 
Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy: detection of abnormal gallbladder motor function in patients with chronic acalculous gallbladder disease. CCK cholescintigrams were performed in 374 patients with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, biliary colic, and a normal gallbladder sonogram and/or cholecystogram. The results of these examinations were correlated with the patients' final medical/surgical diagnoses. Twenty-seven patients recruited as control volunteers without objective clinical evidence of biliary disease also underwent CCK cholescintigraphy to determine if the degree of gallbladder contraction post-CCK differs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. Decreased gallbladder motor function was identified (maximal gallbladder ejection fraction response to CCK less than 35%) in 94% of patients with histopathologically confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis or the cystic duct syndrome and in 88% of patients clinically believed to have chronic acalculous biliary disease. Decreased gallbladder motor function does not distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic gallbladder disease. 
Prevalence of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] excess in coronary artery disease. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is composed of 1 low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle, to which 1 molecule of apolipoprotein (a) is covalently linked. Elevated levels of Lp(a) have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and Lp(a) has been shown to be highly heritable. Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of familial Lp(a) excess in patients with CAD. We determined plasma levels of Lp(a) in 180 patients (150 men and 30 women) with angiographically documented CAD before age 60 years, and in 459 control subjects (276 men and 183 women) clinically free of cardiovascular disease. In addition, Lp(a) levels were determined in families of 102 of the CAD probands (87 men and 15 women). No gender differences in Lp(a) levels were observed between men and women (patients or control subjects). Patients with CAD had higher Lp(a) levels than did control subjects (19 +/- 21 vs 13 +/- 15 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). The prevalence of Lp(a) excess (defined as greater than 90th percentile of controls) was 17% in patients with CAD (p less than 0.05). Lp(a) levels were not correlated with cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apolipoproteins A-I or B. There was a weak correlation between Lp(a) and triglycerides (r = 0.166, p less than 0.05) in patients and control subjects. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that Lp(a) was a risk factor for the presence of CAD in men, independent of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, or apolipoprotein A-I and B levels. Family studies revealed that Lp(a) levels are strongly genetically determined. 
Rubella prevention. Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP). These revised Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommendations for the prevention of rubella update the previous recommendations (MMWR 1984;33:301-10,315-8) to include implementation of a new two-dose schedule for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Current information about vaccine effectiveness, duration of immunity, vaccination in pregnancy, and progress in controlling congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is also included. 
Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B screening in a mental health institution. In 1982, the Ohio Department of Health Screening established guidelines for hepatitis B screening and vaccination for intermediate mental health care facilities. The present study was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these guidelines. Data from an intermediate mental health care institution in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, were used. The analysis considered the direct costs and benefits accrued over a 3-year period and a range of transmission rates. At a 3-year transmission rate of 0.030, the screening and vaccination policy cost $7300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $345,800 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). At a more likely 3-year transmission rate of 0.271, the screening and vaccination policy cost $300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $12,100 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). Either way, the active prevention policy compares very well with the amounts of money spent by the US Government on other life-saving programs. A general cost-effectiveness model is given that can be adapted for institution-specific analyses at other mental health care facilities. 
Complete repair of atrioventricular septal defect. We report our experience with 103 consecutive children who underwent repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect between 1971 and 1990. Ninety-one patients were less than 18 months old (mean age, 6.2 months; mean weight, 5.8 kg) and were repaired using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. There were 15 perioperative deaths. Twelve patients were older (mean age, 40.2 months; mean weight, 18.9 kg) and were repaired using moderate hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass. There were two perioperative deaths. Repairs were performed with the single-patch technique. Four younger patients required repeat repair to control residual mitral regurgitation. Two of the older children required late reoperation to replace one or both atrioventricular valves. Three younger children underwent pulmonary artery banding initially; 1 died after complete repair. Three older children underwent initial pulmonary artery banding; 2 died at definitive repair, and the survivor required pulmonary artery reconstruction, which was repeated subsequently. Since 1977 our policy has been to perform primary definitive repair whenever possible. Two patients died late from unrelated causes. At the most recent follow-up the majority of patients had no or minimal symptoms. We continue to advocate primary definitive repair whenever possible using the single-patch technique in symptomatic patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect. 
Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Crohn's disease is a perplexing panintestinal disease whose etiology is unknown. Symptoms and complications vary greatly from patient to patient. Despite the fact that no cure exists, thoughtful, well-planned therapy and appropriate timely intervention, where needed, can result in maintenance of a high quality of life for affected patients. 
Ballistic trauma to the abdomen: shell fragments versus bullets. Two-hundred ninety-nine patients who sustained penetrating ballistic trauma to the abdomen were divided into two groups: Group A consisted of 133 patients with shell fragment injuries from mortar artillery and Group B of 166 patients with bullet injuries from rifles and automatic or semiautomatic weapons. Both groups were analyzed retrospectively in order to compare the extent of injury and outcome. In Group A, the findings at laparotomy were negative in 15 of 133 patients (10%) compared with 9 of 166 patients (5%) in Group B (p less than 0.05). The most commonly injured abdominal organs in Group A were the colon (42%), liver (22%), small bowel (20%), stomach (14%), diaphragm (11%), spleen (10%), major vessels (9%), and kidney (9%). The abdominal organs commonly injured in Group B were the colon (50%), small bowel (41%), liver (33%), major vessels (20%), diaphragm (17%), stomach (15%), spleen (15%), and kidney (15%). Associated extra-abdominal injuries were present in 26% of Group A patients and in 21% of Group B patients (p less than 0.05). Major postoperative complications occurred in 7.5% and 8.4% of the patients in Group A and Group B, respectively (p less than 0.05). Perioperative mortality was 2.3% in Group A versus 7.2% in Group B (p less than 0.01). Our data suggest that high energy bullets to the abdomen cause higher tissue penetration and a greater blast effect than shell fragments. 
Recurrent aphthous ulcers in association with HIV infection. Description of ulcer types and analysis of T-lymphocyte subsets. This study was conducted to characterize the recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) found in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to examine evidence for increased severity of the ulcers with HIV disease, and to determine whether increased severity is associated with abnormalities of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. Seventy-five HIV-seropositive patients with RAU were followed for up to 2 years, and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 42. Minor, herpetiform, and major ulcer types were seen, but unexpectedly, 66% of the patients had the usually uncommon herpetiform and major types. These types were temporally associated with symptomatic HIV disease. Patients with major RAU were significantly more immunosuppressed than those with minor or herpetiform RAU in that they had fewer CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (p less than 0.05). The lesion of RAU is considered to represent a local breakdown in immunoregulation. The systemic immune imbalance seen with HIV disease may amplify the local defect and lead to more severe ulcers. 
Formation of neutralizing antibodies against natural interferon-beta, but not against recombinant interferon-gamma during adjuvant therapy for high-risk malignant melanoma patients. In an adjuvant clinical trial, 34 high-risk malignant melanoma patients were treated with natural interferon (IFN)-beta and recombinant IFN-gamma. Patients with tumor location on head, neck, and trunk received 3 million IU IFN-beta intravenously (IV) three times weekly for 24 weeks. Patients with tumor location on the extremities received subcutaneous (SC) injection of 2 million IU of IFN-beta distal the locoregional lymph nodes instead. All patients were given 50 micrograms IFN-gamma SC on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antibody formation was detected by coincubation of IFN and patients' serum and assessment of the inhibition of the cytopathic effect by a virus suspension. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. No antibodies against IFN-gamma were observed. The overall incidence of antibody formation to IFN-beta was 55.8% (19/34). Ninety-two percent of the SC-treated patients (13/14) and 30% (six of 20) of the IV-treated patients developed antibodies. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors were found to be significantly lower in antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients. The authors conclude that IFN-beta antibody formation is frequent and might influence IFN induced sIL-2R elevation in vivo. 
Repair of coarctation of the aorta in children: postoperative morphology. To determine the morphologic sequelae after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta, the authors retrospectively reviewed angiograms and hemodynamic and clinical data on 215 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta during a 13-year period. Ninety-seven patients (45%) underwent coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis; 92 (43%), subclavian-flap angioplasties; and 26 (12%), synthetic-patch repairs. Sixty-four patients (30%) had an "aneurysm," defined as a measurement ratio of repair site to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 1.5. Transverse-arch or isthmic hypoplasia or recoarctation was detected in 86 patients (40%) and was most commonly associated with septal defects or obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Pullback systolic pressure gradients at catheterization were significantly higher (P = .0001) in the patients with transverse-arch hypoplasia and recoarctation than in those with ratios of transverse arch to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 0.9. Significant postoperative arch obstructions can be predicted with measurement ratios on the basis of the diameter of the abdominal aorta. 
Can transcutaneous recordings detect gastric electrical abnormalities? The ability of transcutaneous recordings of gastric electrical activity to detect gastric electrical abnormalities was determined by simultaneous measurements of gastric electrical activity with surgically implanted serosal electrodes and cutaneous electrodes in six patients undergoing abdominal operations. Transient abnormalities in gastric electrical activity were seen in five of the six patients during the postoperative period. Recognition of normal gastric electrical activity by visual analysis was possible 67% of the time and with computer analysis 95% of the time. Ninety four per cent of abnormalities in frequency were detected by visual analysis and 93.7% by computer analysis. Abnormalities involving a loss of coupling, however, were not recognised by transcutaneous recordings. Transcutaneous recordings of gastric electrical activity assessed by computer analysis can usually recognise normal gastric electrical activity and tachygastria. Current techniques, however, are unable to detect abnormalities in electrical coupling. 
Cocultures: a new lead in embryo quality improvement for assisted reproduction. One of the contributory causes to poor PRs in assisted reproduction has been the decreased viability of transferred embryos and the transfer of four-cell embryos into an environment that naturally would be receptive only to 5-day-old blastocysts. In this paper, we have reviewed our own work and that of others on the role of tubal ampullary cells (cocultures) to mimic the in vivo environment to bring about improved embryo quality and an increased number of blastocysts for replacement in IVF patients. The establishment, maintenance, and behavior of human tubal cell lines is first presented, followed by their use as cocultures for fertilization and cleavage of embryos. The mode of action, specificity, and cryopreservation of ampullary cells are also discussed. The currently available results of pregnancies after cocultures are presented together with future aspects of research that are necessary to refine the coculture system. The ultimate aim is to mimic in vivo conditions in vitro, so that at least the PRs of assisted conception can be parallel to normal fecundity in the human. Therefore, a very attractive future includes the freezing of blastocysts generated from coculture, thawing, and replacing them in natural cycles. 
Mathematical modeling of antigen and immune complex kinetics during extracorporeal removal of autoantibody. The extracorporeal removal of circulating auto-antibodies by repeated plasma exchange or continuous lymph drainage is modeled by single-pool kinetics. Total amounts of antigenic determinants, k-valent antibodies and immune complexes are variables of the model. Factors influencing the course of therapy are included: production rate of antigen and antibody and their natural catabolism. This model can give useful formulae for clinical practice. The effect of treatment can be predicted from the relative depletion of antibody and the actual severity of the disease. Another formula shows how the changed catabolism of antigen after antibody binding can influence the amount of immune complexes. As an example, lymph drainage in myasthenia gravis is calculated using averaged data from three patients. 
Colonic fermentation of dietary fibre to short chain fatty acids in patients with adenomatous polyps and colonic cancer. Short chain (C2-C6) fatty acids are produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation of mainly dietary fibre. Butyrate (C4) possesses antineoplastic effects on human colon carcinoma cells, and epidemiological studies indicate that high fibre diets may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The role of dietary fibre during colorectal carcinogenesis might therefore be related to its fermentation to butyrate. Faecal concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and concentrations and ratios of the individual C2-C6 fatty acids did not differ between 16 healthy controls, 17 patients with colonic adenomas, and 17 patients with colonic cancer. Comparison of the molar production velocities (mmol/l.hour) of total and individual short chain fatty acids from glucose, ispagula, wheat bran, and albumin in six and 24 hour faecal incubations showed no differences. The ratio of butyrate production to total short chain fatty acid production from fibre, however, was reduced in patients with colonic cancer and adenomas compared with healthy controls (ispagula, six hours: 6.4, 7.6, and 11.5% respectively, p = 0.005 and 24 hour: 9.1, 9.9, and 15.4%, p = 0.002; wheat bran, six hours: 9.9, 10.2, and 14.7% respectively, p = 0.06 and 24 hours: 15.1, 16.8, and 21.0%, p = 0.01). It may be that the low ratios of colonic butyrate formation combined with low fibre diets increase the risk of colonic neoplasia. 
The natural history of HELLP syndrome: patterns of disease progression and regression. Despite much recent interest in HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), there is little published information about the natural history of this unique form of severe preeclampsia-eclampsia. The time course and pattern of laboratory abnormalities for 158 patients with HELLP syndrome managed in a single tertiary referral center between 1980 and 1989 were studied retrospectively. Despite considerable patient variation, most gravid women with HELLP syndrome had decreasing platelet counts until 24 to 48 hours after delivery. Conversely, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations usually peaked 24 to 48 hours post partum. In all patients who recovered, a platelet count greater than 1,000,000/mm3 was spontaneously achieved by the sixth postpartum day or within 72 hours of platelet nadir. An upward trend in platelet count and a downward trend in lactate dehydrogenase concentrations should be apparent in patients without complications by the fourth postpartum day. These data provide baseline information against which the course of individual patients can be compared and the infrequent, atypical case identified for interventive therapy. 
Splenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain. She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed. At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament. The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis. A short review of splenosis is presented. 
Immunohematologic characteristics of infection-associated cerebral infarction. We evaluated 50 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke to assess the prevalence of systemic infection preceding the neurological event. We analyzed the immunohematologic characteristics of patients with and without signs and/or symptoms of a preceding infectious process. Patients were examined less than or equal to 7 days after cerebral infarction and evaluated for fibrinogen, anticardiolipin antibodies, fibrin D-dimer (a fragment of cross-linked fibrin), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein S. Of the 50 patients, 17 had symptoms of infection beginning less than or equal to 1 month before the stroke (11 had upper respiratory tract infections, three urinary tract infections, two subacute bacterial endocarditis, and one pneumonia). Compared with patients without infection, patients with infection had significant increases in fibrin D-dimer concentration (5.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.7 +/- 0.9 log-transformed ng/ml, p less than 0.05) and cardiolipin immunoreactivity, IgG isotype (1.8 +/- 1.3 versus 1.1 +/- 0.9 log-transformed phospholipid units, p less than 0.04), and, when studied less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke, increased fibrinogen levels (459 +/- 126 versus 360 +/- 94 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, infection-associated cerebral infarction is common and is associated with substantial immunohematologic abnormalities. 
Postphlebitic syndrome and general surgery: an epidemiologic investigation. Of a random sample comprising 4581 subjects from The Copenhagen County, 3608 (79%) attended an interview and a general health examination. The subjects were defined as suffering from subjective postphlebitic syndrome if they claimed of lower extremity pain or cramps at rest and from objective postphlebitic syndrome if varicose veins, edema, lower extremity ulcers, or skin changes were present. By means of logistic regression analysis, subjective postphlebitic syndrome was found independently associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, increasing age, female sex, hormonal therapy, varicose veins, and previous major abdominal surgery. Objective postphlebitic syndrome was associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, former birthgiving, and high social status. The findings support the view that subclinical deep venous thrombosis in connection with previous surgery may give rise to symptoms in the lower extremities. 
Acute antihypertensive and renal effects of isradipine in hypertensive patients with normal and reduced renal function. The renal effects of a single oral dose of placebo v a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, isradipine, were investigated in 12 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Six patients (group A) had normal creatinine concentrations greater than 1.6 mg/dL. Patients maintained a constant daily intake of approximately 120 mmol of sodium and 50 mmol of potassium. Measurements were taken at 30, 60, and 90 min after drug administration. Results indicated that isradipine at a dose of 5 mg once daily produced significant antihypertensive and renal responses. In conclusion, there is therapeutic benefit with isradipine independent of the status of renal function. 
Pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension has its experimental counterpart in the two-kidney, one clip model (Goldblatt hypertension). From the study of this model, a general pathophysiological scheme has evolved suggesting that temporal stages in the development and maintenance of hypertension are regulated by complicated hormonal and neural interrelations. The central roles played by the renin-angiotensin system and the renal nerves is discussed as they relate to other hormones. In addition, the possible contribution of converting enzyme inhibitors to understanding the pathophysiology of this condition is discussed. 
Observation of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct using three-dimensional surface reconstruction imaging. Observation of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was hitherto possible only in cadavers or dry temporal bones; however, by applying three-dimensional surface reconstruction imaging, it is now possible to observe solid-looking images of this structure in living humans. When the width of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was measured in 58 people, it was found to be significantly narrower in the affected ears of patients with Meniere's disease than in normal ears. 
Bright pleural effusion and ascites on gradient-echo MR images: a potential source of confusion in vascular MR studies. Motion of fluids other than blood can cause flow-related signal enhancement on MR images, including MR angiograms. In order to study this problem, the appearance of ascites (20 patients) and pleural effusions (five patients) was assessed on MR images made during suspended respiration with flow-compensated gradient-echo sequences as well as T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Signal intensities of vessels, fluid collections, and muscle were measured and vessel/muscle and vessel/fluid contrast were calculated. Fluid motion was measured with a bolus tracking technique that tags a selected volume of fluid with an RF presaturation. Fluid collections had a bright signal in four of five patients with pleural effusion and in 15 of 20 patients with ascites. The average contrast ratio between bright components of the fluid collections and vessels was only 0.03 +/- 0.09. Bright fluid collections were seen on MR angiograms and could obscure blood vessels. Bolus tracking measurements of ascites revealed multidirectional flow, suggesting that its bright signal is related to motion that continues during suspended respiration. Fluid collections appeared dark on T1-weighted images in all patients, indicating that a short T1 relaxation time was not a cause of the high signal intensity. The results indicate that, despite breath-holding, ascites and pleural effusions can show bright signal intensity on gradient-echo images. Awareness of this phenomenon will avoid confusion between moving fluid collections and flowing blood and identify a source of image degradation on both gradient-echo and T2-weighted spin-echo MR acquisitions. 
Alpha 2-macroglobulin is not an acute-phase protein in the rat testis. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that Sertoli cells actively synthesize and secrete a nonspecific protease inhibitor in vitro; N-terminal sequence analysis, subunit structural analysis, and other biological studies revealed that this protein is the homolog of serum alpha 2-macroglobulin. We have now quantified the relative distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the reproductive compartments and their comparison with nonreproductive organs. In serum and all nonreproductive tissues examined, the concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin progressively decreased with advancing age. However, in both the testis and epididymis, the levels of this protein increased with the age of the animals. Serum alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were consistently higher than those in any other tissues until 60 days when the concentrations of this protein were the highest in the epididymis. The distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in various nonreproductive tissues from female rats was similar to that observed for male rats in that its levels tended to decrease with age. However, uterine levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin increased progressively with advancing age, whereas ovarian levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin remained relatively stable with an increase in animal age. As serum alpha 2-macroglobulin is an acute-phase protein in the rat, the response of this protein in the testis to induced inflammation was examined. The concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin in serum rose about 150-fold after injection of fermented yeast. By contrast, the levels of this protein in rete testis fluid, which is derived exclusively from seminiferous fluid, did not change in response to inflammation. These results suggest that there might be distinctive mechanisms that regulate this protein in the systemic circulation vs. the microenvironment behind the blood-testis barrier in the seminiferous epithelium. 
Pulmonary hypertension and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase after esophageal cancer operations. To evaluate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase in pulmonary impairment occurring after operation for esophageal cancer, 10 patients were randomized preoperatively into two equal groups. One group received a placebo infusion and the other, an infusion of the PMN elastase inhibitor ulinastatin. In the placebo group, the mean plasma PMN elastase level increased from 154 +/- 23 micrograms/L preoperatively to 449 +/- 56 micrograms/L at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01), whereas the mean plasma fibronectin concentration decreased from 490 +/- 70 micrograms/mL preoperatively to 265 +/- 81 micrograms/L on postoperative day 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly from 151 +/- 24 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 preoperatively to 284 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In the group given ulinastatin, 150,000 units every 12 hours from the start of the operation, the mean PMN elastase value at 6 hours postoperatively was lower (275 +/- 66 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01) and the fibronectin level on postoperative days 1 and 2, higher (p less than 0.05). A lower pulmonary vascular resistance was noted into day 2 (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that PMN elastase may participate in the development of postoperative pulmonary impairment. 
Echocardiographic demonstration of decreased left ventricular dimensions and vigorous myocardial contraction during syncope induced by head-up tilt. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during a head-up tilt test in 11 control subjects (group I) and 18 patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. In four patients (group II), the head-up tilt test was negative at baseline and after isoproterenol infusion. Syncope was induced during baseline head-up tilt in nine patients (group III) and after isoproterenol challenge in five (group IV). The echocardiographic variables assessed were left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic areas and percent fractional shortening. At the end of head-up tilt, end-systolic area decreased by 4.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.0 +/- 1.2 cm2 in groups III and IV, respectively, compared with 0.5 +/- 0.7 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 cm2 in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Similarly, end-diastolic area decreased by 5.5 +/- 2.6 cm2 in group III compared with 2.7 +/- 1.9 and 1.75 +/- 0.4 cm2 in group I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Additionally, at the end of the baseline study, fractional shortening was significantly greater in group III and group IV (43 +/- 5%) than in groups I and II (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, syncope induced by head-up tilt is associated with vigorous myocardial contraction and a significant decrease in left ventricular end-systolic dimensions. This left ventricular hypercontractility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of syncope induced by head-up tilt. 
Hepatitis B and C viruses and their interaction in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum taken from patients in a case-control study in Athens, Greece, was used to examine the interactive roles of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC. 
Multiple myeloma: increased circulating lymphocytes carrying plasma cell-associated antigens as an indicator of poor survival. In multiple myeloma (MM) an increase in circulating lymphocytes expressing plasma cell-associated antigens (PCAA) has been described. Its prognostic significance was evaluated in this study. The immunologic phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes was analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for B, T, natural killer lymphocytes, and PCAA (CD38, PCA1) in 52 MM patients at diagnosis, remission, and during relapse, 18 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 25 normal controls. No significant phenotypic alteration was observed in MGUS. In MM, the number of B lymphocytes was in the normal range at diagnosis and during the subsequent phases. A CD4/CD8 ratio decrease, during relapse, was due to both a CD4+ reduction and to an expansion of a subset of CD8+ activated suppressor lymphocytes. CD38+ and PCA1+ lymphocytes at diagnosis were significantly higher than in MGUS, and a further increase was observed during relapse, suggesting a correlation between PCAA expression and disease activity. The prognostic significance of increased PCAA was confirmed by a survival analysis of 32 patients evaluated at diagnosis using a CD38 cutoff of 0.45 x 10(9)/L positive lymphocytes. Median survival for patients with high values was only 14 months, whereas it was not reached at 32 months by those with low values (P less than .0007). 
Giant cell arteritis presenting as limb claudication. Report and review of the literature. Upper limb claudication and pulselessness is an uncommon presentation of giant cell arteritis (GCA), often resulting in delayed diagnosis. We describe such a case diagnosed by angiography, in which a temporal artery biopsy showed classic GCA, despite the absence of local signs or symptoms. A review of 26 similar cases revealed that in 81% of patients where the only manifestation of GCA was upper limb findings, temporal artery biopsy yielded positive findings. Steroid therapy clinically improved 24/26 patients. These findings suggest that a consideration of temporal artery biopsy early in the investigation will hasten diagnosis and appropriate therapy. 
Lack of C-erbB-2 protein expression in pulmonary carcinoid tumours. To determine if amplification of the C-erb-B2 proto-oncogene could be correlated with prognosis in carcinoid tumours, 49 pulmonary carcinoid tumours (26 typical, 23 atypical) were examined using a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal peptide of the C-erb-B2 protein sequence. No C-erb-B2 gene product could be shown: the demonstration of C-erb-B2 does not seem to help, therefore, in determining diagnosis or prognosis in pulmonary carcinoid tumours. 
CHARGE and Joubert syndromes: are they a single disorder? A patient with the CHARGE association (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defect, Atresia of the choana, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies or deafness) had intermittent hyperpnea and cerebellar hypoplasia; therefore, he had both the CHARGE association and Joubert syndrome. The 2 syndromes have not been previously linked. We discuss their similarities and review the literature. 
Femoral-distal bypass with in situ greater saphenous vein. Long-term results using the Mills valvulotome. During a 7-year period, 440 consecutive in situ saphenous vein grafts originating in the groin were performed in 371 patients, exposing the entire vein for valvulotomy with a modified Mills valvulotome. critical ischemia was the indication for bypass in 68%, and the distal anastomosis was to an infrapopliteal artery in 46%. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.0%. Postoperative surveillance identified 18 stenotic grafts (4.1%), which were revised while still patent (primary revised patency); 36 grafts (8.2%) underwent revision after graft occlusion (secondary patency). Five-year life-table analysis showed overall primary revised patency of 78%, secondary patency of 83%, limb salvage of 88%, and patient survival of 66%. Femoroperoneal and inframalleolar bypasses fared well. The presence of diabetes did not diminish late graft patency. In contrast to reversed vein grafts, long infrapopliteal in situ grafts had long-term secondary patency similar to shorter femoropopliteal bypass grafts (p greater than 0.05). These results, coupled with the versatility and simplicity of the technique as used in the present series, suggest that in situ vein grafting is the procedure of choice for long infrapopliteal bypass. 
Identifying risk factors in development of clinically significant post-shock-wave lithotripsy subcapsular hematomas. A retrospective study of 1,012 shock-wave lithotripsy treatments was performed to identify and analyze the risk factors for the development of six clinically significant post-extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) subcapsular hematomas. The patients studied had clinical signs and symptoms that on evaluation were confirmed as originating from a subcapsular hematoma. Common factors identified which we believe may put patients at increased risk for the development of subcapsular hematoma included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and obesity. 
Pain centers--organization and outcome. Pain treatment centers have evolved at a rapid rate, but they differ in their complexity and services provided. Patients, as well as primary care physicians, have difficulty in identifying the appropriate center for a specific problem. Guidelines for pain centers have recently been proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, along with an attempt at their accreditation. Outcome studies from pain centers have proliferated, with a wide range of treatment programs being reported. Comprehensive multidisciplinary pain centers using the rehabilitation medicine approach are effective in decreasing disability and increasing the productivity of patients with chronic, disabling pain. 
A universal ossicular replacement prosthesis: clinical trials of 152 cases. An ossicular replacement prosthesis is described that advances implant design in several respects. The head is a flattened egg shape, which eliminates pressure points against the pars tensa and provided balance on the stapes. Dense hydroxylapatite ceramic provides maximal biocompatibility. The shaft, of either Teflon or Plastipore, is easily cut to size and is replaceable to minimize wastage. Interchangeable partial or total shaft variants are provided. Trials in more than 200 patients have produced optimal results. Among 152 mature patients in 85% of the good-risk cases, the air-bone gap closed to within 20 dB and in 65% to within 10 dB; in 69% of all cases the gap closed to within 20 dB. Extrusion rates were 5% in good-risk cases and 7% overall. Long-term extrusions have not occurred. Inasmuch as cartilage interpositioning is unnecessary, the prosthesis is rapidly prepared and implanted by an easily mastered technique. 
Exercise training after cardiac transplantation. During the last decade, cardiac transplantation has become the accepted form of treatment for selected patients with end-stage heart disease, which usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. Although 5-yr survival is currently 85%, patients have complicated courses after surgery, with an ever present risk of infection and graft rejection. Because of physical inactivity and severe limitation of cardiac output preoperatively, these deconditioned patients are excellent candidates for medically supervised rehabilitative exercise training programs. Denervation of the myocardium, which occurs with cardiac transplantation, results in a loss of autonomic nervous system modulation of cardiac output, with reliance on circulating catecholamines and with a delayed heart rate and cardiac output response to the onset of exercise. Oxygen uptake kinetics are prolonged, and maximal oxygen uptake is reduced. Additional abnormalities in cardiac and pulmonary artery pressures and in ventilation during exercise have been described. The literature contains seven studies concerning the effects of exercise training in cardiac transplant recipients. Benefits resulting from training include increases in maximal oxygen uptake, peak exercise power output, anaerobic threshold, and lean body mass, reduced perceived exertion, heart rate, and blood pressure during submaximal exercise, and a lowered resting heart rate and blood pressure. There are no data to suggest that exercise training alters the incidence of infection or rejection or improves longevity or return to pre-illness lifestyle. 
The pseudotumor syndrome. Disorders of cerebrospinal fluid circulation causing intracranial hypertension without ventriculomegaly. We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as normally defined. The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. 
Corticobasal degeneration. A unique pattern of regional cortical oxygen hypometabolism and striatal fluorodopa uptake demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Corticobasal degeneration presents with an asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome, apraxia and combinations of supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, and an alien limb. Six patients aged 59-77 yrs, diagnosed on clinical criteria as having corticobasal degeneration, have been studied with positron emission tomography using tracers of dopamine storage capacity and oxygen metabolism. Striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake was reduced in an asymmetric pattern, caudate and putamen being involved in all cases. Uptake into medial frontal cortex was also impaired. Regional cortical oxygen metabolism was most significantly depressed in the superior and posterior temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital associated cortices. Within the frontal lobe, the hypometabolism was chiefly posterior. This unique combination of regional hypometabolism and disruption of the nigrostriatal system is discussed in relation to the clinical features of the disease and is compared with reported findings in other disorders of cognition and movement. 
Lymphoproliferative lesion of the hypoglossal nerve: case report. A rare case of a lymphoproliferative lesion in the hypoglossal nerve is reported. The patient, a 52-year-old woman, had symptoms identical with those of hypoglossal neurinoma. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion at the left cerebellomedullary angle. The tumor was removed, and histopathological studies revealed that the tumor consisted predominantly of lymphocytes. 
Relevance of common tests of cerebrospinal fluid in screening for bacterial meningitis. This study tests the hypothesis that if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a nucleated blood cell count (NucBC) of less than 6/mm3, CSF tests other than bacterial culture need not be performed to exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients not receiving antimicrobial agents. The results of tests performed on the first specimen of CSF obtained for a given hospital visit from children younger than 3 years of age, exclusive of newborn infants admitted to the hospital on their date of birth, were analyzed. Of 3356 CSF specimens evaluated, 122 were from patients with bacterial meningitis; 460 specimens were analyzed separately because the erythrocyte count was greater than 1000/mm3. A negative CSF screening test result was defined as a CSF NucBC less than 6/mm3. In facilitating the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, this screening test had a sensitivity of 98.4%, a specificity of 75.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The other CSF tests varied widely in screening effectiveness: a Gram-stained smear had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the screening relevance of CSF tests. The CSF NucBC and CSF segmented NucBC performed indistinguishably and superiorly compared with the CSF protein or glucose concentration and the ratio of CSF glucose to serum glucose concentration. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NucBC alone is superior to any combination of the other CSF tests. In a prospective study of 215 children younger than 3 years of age undergoing a lumbar puncture in our emergency department, 85% had empiric criteria identifying them as appropriate for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. The CSF NucBC was less than 6/mm3 in 70% of the 181 patients who would have been eligible for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. These data suggest that a strategy for the sequential testing of CSF could be adopted that would exclude unnecessary determinations and thereby save time, effort, and health care dollars. 
Medical problems of homeless and nonhomeless persons attending an inner-city clinic: a comparative study. The identification of homelessness as a national problem has focused attention on defining the needs of this sizable population. Existing studies on the medical problems of the homeless are largely descriptive and are limited by lack of comparison to nonhomeless persons. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a retrospective study of the medical problems of homeless and nonhomeless persons cared for in an outpatient clinic serving the medically indigent. Homeless persons (n = 150) were more likely to be identified as alcoholic and to be seen for cuts and gynecologic problems than nonhomeless persons (n = 154) (p less than .01). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of other illnesses considered to be prevalent in the homeless. This study is among the first that validates descriptive data on the health problems of homeless persons by using concurrent nonhomeless controls. It may help in designing programs to meet the medical needs of the homeless. 
Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision: the patient's perspective. Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision is currently accomplished using a variety of surgical techniques. A multi-institutional survey of patient perceptions of facial reanimation success was accomplished by mailing a questionnaire to 809 randomly selected members of the Acoustic Neuroma Association. Four hundred sixty patients who underwent 296 reanimation procedures responded. Facial to hypoglossal nerve anastomosis, tarsorrhaphy, and upper eyelid implants were most frequently performed. The patient's estimations of initial deficit, spontaneous recovery, and overall satisfaction with the reanimation procedures are discussed. 
Mass closure of the abdominal wound with delayed absorbable suture in surgery for gynecologic cancer. There has been a resurgence of interest recently in the optimal method of closure of the midline abdominal wound. The focus has been on the high-risk patient in particular. The controversy centers on interrupted versus continuous fascial closure and the choice of suture material. For three years on a gynecologic cancer service, running mass closure with delayed absorbable suture (Polyglactin) was used. Two hundred fifty-six patients were evaluable for analysis. The minimum follow-up time was two years. There was no wound dehiscence. Fourteen patients (5.5%) developed incisional hernias. The mass closure technique using delayed absorbable suture was effective in very-high-risk patients. 
Postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas. Most series dealing with external gastrointestinal fistulas cover experience of many years and include a heterogeneous sample of fistulas. We present our experience with 117 cases of postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas treated since 1980. Only fistulas caused by anastomotic leaks and operative injury to bowel are included. The overall mortality rate was 37%. The fistulas are classified into four types: type I-abdominal, esophagus, gastroduodenal (mortality rate, 17%); type II-small bowel (mortality rate, 33%); type III-large bowel (mortality rate, 20%), and type IV-all sites associated with a large abdominal wall defect (mortality rate, 60%). The main cause of death was intra-abdominal infection. Seventy-six percent of the patients required further operations. We conclude that despite the availability of all modern diagnostic and management facilities, postoperative external gastrointestinal fistulas treated during the 1980s continue to represent a surgical "disaster." Only prevention and improved methods in the management of the associated intra-abdominal infections could improve the results. 
High levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptors in hyperthyroid patients: correlation with serum thyroid hormones and independence from the etiology of the hyperthyroidism. The serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (s-IL-2R) and soluble CD8 antigens (s-CD8) were measured in 33 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 29 with toxic nodular goiter (TNG), 6 with toxic adenoma (TA), and 12 with hypothyroidism, as well as in 11 patients with infectious mononucleosis (known to have high s-IL-2R and s-CD8 levels) and 34 normal controls. Serum levels of T3 and T4, both total and free, and of TSH were simultaneously determined. s-IL-2R levels were significantly higher in all patients with hyperthyroidism (mean +/- SD, 3276 +/- 1273 U/mL for GD, 4183 +/- 1832 for TNG, and 1671 +/- 648 for TA) compared to normal control values (P less than 0.001 for GD and TNG and P less than 0.01 for TA), while in the euthyroid state they were within the normal range (535 +/- 240 U/mL). Hypothyroid patients had significantly lower s-IL-2R levels compared to normal controls (P less than 0.05). A positive correlation (P less than 0.001) between serum s-IL-2R levels and total/free T3-T4 levels was found in these groups of patients, while no correlation between s-CD8 levels and s-IL-2R/T3/T4 was found. These findings suggest an association between hyperthyroxinaemia and activation of human lymphocytes in vivo. 
Expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 in septic but not traumatic/hypovolemic shock in the baboon. Baboons were subjected to septic or traumatic/hypovolemic shock and their tissues were examined for the de novo expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1), using immunohistochemical techniques. In animals with septic shock induced with live Escherichia coli, there was widespread expression of ELAM-1, recognized by monoclonal antibodies H4/18 or ENA-1 in most tissues examined with strong staining in the lung, liver, and kidneys. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 expression was evident in capillaries, venules, small veins, arterioles, and arteries. In contrast, baboons with traumatic/hypovolemic shock had minimal levels of focal ELAM expression in all organs studied. Similarly evidence of neutrophil activation, measured by granulocyte elastase levels in the plasma was much more pronounced in animals with septic shock. The study documents that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-induced endothelial activation occurs in vivo in septic shock. Much higher levels of ELAM-1 expression and plasma granulocyte-elastase titer in septic shock, as contrasted with traumatic/hypovolemic shock, are consistent with the higher levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines, and LPS in sepsis. 
Prevention of perioperative deep vein thrombosis in general surgery: a multicentre double blind study comparing two doses of Logiparin and standard heparin. H.B.P.M. Research Group. A total of 1290 patients were enrolled in a randomized multicentre double blind study in order to investigate the use of two doses of a new low molecular weight heparin, Logiparin, in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in general surgery. Patients who were included had no contraindication to heparin therapy and had at least one of the recognized risk factors for DVT. Patients were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin (UH) 5000 units b.d., Logiparin 2500 units daily or Logiparin 3500 units daily. Each treatment was given subcutaneously 2 h before surgery and continued for 7-10 days. Daily 125I-labelled fibrinogen uptake tests (FUTs) were performed from day 2 to day 7 to detect DVT, and phleboangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis. The wound was examined on a daily basis to check for haematoma formation, and all patients were followed up for 1 month after operation. All three treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, weight, diagnosis and type of operation performed. The three major inclusion criteria in the trial were malignancy, age over 60 years and a history of varicose veins. Positive FUTs (UH = 4.2 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 7.9 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 3.7 per cent) and positive angiograms (UH = 3.0 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 5.6 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 2.3 per cent) were significantly more common in the Logiparin 2500 units daily group than in the UH and Logiparin 3500 units daily groups. The rates of major complications (severe haemorrhage, death, pulmonary embolism, reintervention) were similar in the three groups. 
Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting with ondansetron: a randomized, double-blind comparison with placebo. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common after recovery from general anesthesia. The antiemetic effect and safety of ondansetron, a selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, was determined in 36 patients suffering from nausea or vomiting during recovery from intravenous anesthesia by giving either a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (8 mg, n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) over 2-5 min in a randomized, double-blind manner. A "rescue" antiemetic was provided in case of continued vomiting or at the patient's request. Antiemetic efficacy was defined as no request for rescue antiemetic and/or no vomiting episode during the next 4 h. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between the groups. Administration of ondansetron or placebo had no significant effect on vital signs. Ondansetron was an effective antiemetic in 78% (14/18) and placebo was effective in 28% (5/18) of the patients. Laboratory studies 24 h later showed no signs of hematologic, hepatic, or renal alterations. Ondansetron at a dose of 8 mg administered intravenously over 2-5 min appears to be a safe and effective antiemetic for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting after intravenous anesthesia. 
Testicular injuries. We reviewed 91 testicular injuries in 86 patients (5 bilateral) as a result of blunt trauma in 72 patients and gunshot wounds in 14 patients. In 90 percent of the patients the injury was solitary. With blunt trauma initially conservative management led to the loss of the entire testis in 21 percent in comparison with only 6 percent of those explored promptly. The recent use of testicular ultrasonography has not differentiated intratesticular hematoma from rupture in the majority of cases of blunt trauma. Bilateral testicular injury occurred in 1 of 72 patients (1.4%) with blunt trauma versus 4 of 14 (29%) with penetrating trauma and affected the fertility in 3 of 4 patients on follow-up. 
Interleukin-3. Biologic effects and clinical impact. Human interleukin-3 (IL-3) is expressed in yeast and has a specific activity of 5 x 10(7) U/mg of protein. It exerts functional and proliferative effects on multiple hematopoietic cell lineages including the neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, monocytic, and thrombopoietic cell lines. IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) share common binding capacities on hematopoietic cells. Each of these agents has entered clinical trials. The clinical experiences with IL-3 alone and in combination with GM-CSF in a Phase I/II trial are summarized in this report. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the Dundee technique A total of 61 patients was subjected to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure was completed in 60 cases and converted to open operation in one (2 per cent). The morbidity rate was low (total 7 per cent, major 2 per cent, blood transfusion rate 5 per cent). The median duration of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiography was 135 min (range 65-270 min). The operation took less time to complete in patients with functioning gallbladders than in those with non-functioning fibrotic organs (median 120 versus 175 min). The majority of patients required opiate analgesia despite infiltration of the stab wounds with bupivacaine. The mean (s.d.) hospital stay was 2.9 (1.5) days. The median time to resume work or full activity after discharge was 11 days. 
Central motor pathways in patients with mirror movements. Central motor pathways were investigated in three patients with congenital mirror movements using magnetic motor cortex stimulation. Response thresholds, amplitudes and latencies were normal. The projection of the corticomotoneuronal pathways was assessed by placing the coil over the vertex and comparing the size of responses in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles evoked by clockwise and anticlockwise coil currents. In normal subjects, right FDI responses are larger with clockwise currents than with anticlockwise currents at the same stimulation strength and vice versa. In two out of three patients with congenital mirror movements, this sensitivity of response amplitude to coil current direction was reversed. The third patient with congenital mirror movements and a fourth patient with acquired mirror movements had responses which were normally sensitive to current direction. These findings support the hypothesis that some cases of congenital mirror movements may be due to abnormal projection of corticomotoneuronal pathways. 
A selective deficit for writing vowels in acquired dysgraphia Brain-damaged patients with acquired writing disorders provide important information about the normal processes of spelling and writing. Current models indicate that to produce a letter string, its 'abstract' representation is computed and stored in a temporary orthographic buffer, from which it is converted to a verbal code (if the word is to be spelled aloud) or to a physical letter code (if the word is to be written). The stored graphemic representations specify the identity and order of the component letters and their consonant/vowel status. Here I describe the spelling performance of two patients with a selective deficit in writing vowels. When writing words, the first patient omitted all vowels, leaving a blank space between consonants or consonant clusters, whereas the second produced errors that almost exclusively involved vowels. This pattern of performance supports the hypothesis that the consonant/vowel status of graphemes is differentially specified in the spelling process and may be selectively affected after brain damage. 
Double dissociation of short-term and long-term memory for nonverbal material in Parkinson's disease and global amnesia. A further analysis. The traditional concept of memory disorder is deficiency of the long-term (LTM) but not short-term (STM) component of memory. STM impairment with LTM sparing is seldom reported. The present study investigated STM and LTM for nonverbal material in three neurological conditions associated with memory impairment: bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (patient H.M.), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems. 
Melanosis and associated tumors in transgenic mice. Melanosis was found to various extents in a wide array of tissues of all 23 autopsied mice whose transgene consisted of the tyrosinase promoter fused to the simian virus 40 early-region oncogenic sequences. Pigmentation in a given animal was attributable to any or all of the following; an increase in numbers of some normally pigmented cells of neural crest origin (a result compatible with early stages of transformation); elicitation of melanin synthesis in some cells that normally have little melanin, or none at all (the latter possibly signaling metaplasia); unusual intercellular transfer of pigment granules from melanocytes into certain normally unpigmented epithelia and endothelia; and profusion of melanin-phagocytizing cells. Neoplasms, occasionally also containing melanin, arose in association with some of these melanotic tissues and included three choroid plexus tumors, three endocardial tumors, two peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas), two cochlear tumors, two pineal gland tumors, one salivary gland tumor, and one nasal mucosa tumor. These apparently originated independently of the ocular and cutaneous melanomas found in the same animals. The events involved in melanosis may thus contribute to neoplastic conversion. 
Seizures of fronto-orbital origin: a proven case. Distinguishing characteristics of seizures of frontal origin have not been clearly delineated. We describe a case of seizures of proven fronto-orbital origin to provide further definition of characteristics of seizures arising in that lobe. A 36-year-old man had medically intractable seizures since age 8 years. Clinically the seizures were stereotyped, with cessation of activity followed by turning of head and body to the right and then by struggling, kicking, and vocalizations indicating fear. Total seizure duration was approximately 30 s, with an apparent abrupt return of consciousness. The interictal scalp EEGs were similar to those of primary generalized epilepsy, with bisynchronous though asymmetric epileptiform activity anteriorly. Ictal scalp recordings were not localizing. Recordings from bilateral frontal and temporal subdural electrodes showed an electrical focus in the right fronto-orbital region which was confirmed by electrocorticography (ECoG) at the time of craniotomy. The right fronto-orbital cortex was resected and on pathologic examination showed gliotic tissue and intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules consistent with lipofuscinosis. The patient has remained seizure-free for 6 years after operation. 
Chylous ascites and lymphocyst management by peritoneovenous shunt. Although lymphocyst (retroperitoneal lymphocele) is not an uncommon complication after retroperitoneal surgery, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.6% to 48%, the occurrence of chylous ascites is a rare phenomenon. Most reports are anecdotal, and hospital records list the incidence of diagnosis as 0.001% of admissions. Diagnosis of chylous ascites is usually not difficult, inasmuch as aspiration and chemical analysis of the fluid yield the answer. Visualization of retroperitoneal fluid collection by computerized tomography or ultrasonography, however, does always raise the possibility of recurrence of tumor in cases where the primary operation was for cancer. Treatment of smaller lesions can be expectant. Respiratory exercises causing an increase in negative intrathoracic pressure may aid in the movement of fluid through the lymphatics. For larger collections, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition are also often enough, but surgery is sometimes required. Simple insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt, as in this patient, can be as effective as major operations such as identification and ligation of the offending lymphatic or marsupialization of the cyst. 
Accuracy of endosonography in the staging of rectal cancer treated by radiotherapy. Endosonography is the best available method for the pretherapeutic staging of rectal cancer. The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer. New interpretation criteria are needed for evaluation and follow-up of rectal cancer treated by radiotherapy. 
Increased activation of isolated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells in inflammatory bowel disease. Normal human lamina propria lymphocytes are in a heightened state of activation compared with peripheral blood with regard to cell-surface activation antigen expression (transferrin receptor, interleukin-2 receptor, 4F2) and the increased spontaneous secretion of immunoglobulins in vitro. This study evaluates the cell-surface expression of activation-associated antigens in different subpopulations of isolated colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells in inflammatory bowel disease. In pilot studies using three-color flow cytometry, autofluorescence was observed that was emitted by unstained lamina propria mononuclear cells, which interfered with both the sensitivity and the specificity of the analyses. Because a major portion of the intestinal lymphocyte populations of interest were autofluorescent, a method to remove autofluorescence signals was developed by designing a computer program for the subtraction of autofluorescence from the emissions of each individual cell. This technique increases both the sensitivity and specificity of flow-cytometric analyses of intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analyses with subtraction of autofluorescence on a single-cell basis, increased expression of lymphocyte activation antigens (interleukin-2 receptor, transferrin receptor, 4F2) was found on the cell surface of isolated intestinal B cells, T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therefore, markedly increased intestinal lymphocyte activation is a major immunological alteration in inflammatory bowel disease and includes all lymphocyte subpopulations investigated in this study. In addition, 5-aminosalicylic acid, which is used for the treatment of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease, inhibits the expression of cell-surface activation antigens on mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that lymphocyte activation may play an important role in underlying immune processes that lead to chronicity and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease and may implicate an additional mechanism for the therapeutic action of 5-aminosalicylic acid. 
A double-blinded, randomized trial of hydrocortisone in acute hepatic failure. The Acute Hepatic Failure Study Group. The Acute Hepatic Failure Study Group (AHFSG) has conducted a double-blinded, randomized evaluation of hydrocortisone in patients with acute hepatic failure. From July 1975 through August 1978, a 38-month period, 18 medical centers in the United States and one in Canada participated in this trial. A total of 64 patients were accessed and found eligible to participate in the study; two of them were subsequently eliminated from our analysis. Eighteen patients received placebo; 23 received 400 mg hydrocortisone per day, and 21 patients were administered 800 mg hydrocortisone per day. We did not observe any therapeutic effect of hydrocortisone, and the survival rates for placebo versus 400 mg and versus 800 mg hydrocortisone per day were 22%, 9%, and 24%, respectively. Fulminant hepatitis associated with drug hepatotoxicity or non-A, non-B hepatitis seemed to have a worse prognosis than fulminant B, although these differences were not significant. Serum alpha-fetoprotein had a modest prognostic value of survival and seemed to be limited to fulminant B. The AHFSG recommends, therefore, that corticosteroid use in acute hepatic failure with hepatic encephalopathy be discontinued. 
Management of patients aged over 60 years with supratentorial glioma: lessons from an audit. This audit of clinical management confirmed the poor prognosis for patients (n = 80) aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of supratentorial glioma. The median survival time after diagnosis was 9 weeks following steroids and 7 weeks after biopsy and steroids. Cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy improved median survival time by a maximum of 16 weeks, but there was significant morbidity in some patients undergoing craniotomy. Although 92% of the biopsied lesions were either glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, the median survival of these patients was similar to the 8% of patients confirmed as having intermediate grade astrocytoma. Patients presenting with minimal functional deficit (WHO grade I or II) had longer median survival times than those presenting in poor condition (WHO grade III or IV). In this series there was no relationship between management undertaken and clinical status of the patient. The 9% of the cohort that survived 1 year were treated in a variety of ways. This audit, together with results from other studies, suggests that a prospective clinical trial of different management regimes in elderly patients with supratentorial gliomas is needed. Since median survival time in the most intensively treated patients will be around 6 months, treatment evaluation must consider the quality of life provided. 
Diagnosis and treatment of cranial neuralgias. Both medical and surgical therapies may be used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Ordinarily, the treatment is medical; however, if a response to drugs is not forthcoming, or if the patient becomes toxic while taking medications or refuses to abide by an appropriate medical program, then surgical consultation should be obtained and the appropriate operation performed. The form and type of neurosurgical procedure will probably depend to a considerable extent on the expertise of the neurosurgeon and his training. Generally, in the elderly, the simplest procedure should be attempted first. It may be necessary to employ both medical and surgical procedures in the individual patient. The medical drug of first choice is carbamazepine. Atypical facial neuralgia is a general term used to cover a variety of head and face pains that are poorly defined and that may not deserve separate clinical status. The pathogenesis of the atypical facial neuralgias is uncertain, and multiple causation seems likely. Search for local inflammatory pathology, neoplasms, vasomotor phenomena, and depressive symptoms is indicated. Treatment should be guided by the findings. 
Helicobacter pylori in children with peptic ulcer and their families. Little is known about the source and spread of Helicobacter pylori, but transmission from infected family contacts has been suggested. We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H. pylori. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured. Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing. Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H. pylori. Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H. pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H. pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively). The children with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001). The reliability of serum anti-H. pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed. These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H. pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs. 
Noninvasive diagnosis of vascular trauma by duplex ultrasonography. Duplex ultrasonography was used prospectively in the initial evaluation of 198 patients with 319 potential vascular injuries of the neck and extremities. Patients who were unstable or who had obvious arterial trauma were excluded. Injury was caused by gunshot in 104 (53%), blunt trauma in 42 (21%), stab wound in 34 (17%), and shotgun in 18 (9%). Duplex ultrasonography correctly characterized and localized vascular injuries in 23 patients: arterial disruptions (13), intimal flaps (4), acute pseudoaneurysms (3), arteriovenous fistulas (2), and shotgun pellet arteriopuncture (1). Nineteen other patients had vasospasm (13) or external compression (6) without evidence of intrinsic vessel injury, these 42 studies had true-positive results. Twenty patients underwent arterial repair (13 on the basis of duplex ultrasonography alone), one had primary amputation, three required fasciotomy, and 18 were observed. Two patients with false-negative results had minor shotgun pellet arteriopunctures that were missed by duplex ultrasonography, but neither needed repair. One hundred fifty-three patients had true-negative results on duplex ultrasonography: all clinically had only proximity injuries and easily palpable distal pulses. The result of one duplex ultrasonography study was found to be false-positive on arteriography. The sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the overall accuracy was 98%. These results closely approximate those reported with the use of exclusion arteriography in the evaluation of similar vascular trauma patients. Furthermore, duplex ultrasonography has no interventional risks and is more cost-effective for screening such injuries than arteriography or exploration. Duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method of diagnosis in patients with potential peripheral vascular injuries. 
Positron emission tomography demonstrates that coronary sinus retroperfusion can restore regional myocardial perfusion and preserve metabolism. Positron emission tomography was used to image blood flow and metabolic tracers in risk zone myocardium after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion during synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion. Six control and seven intervention open chest dogs had occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Synchronized retroperfusion commenced 25 min later. Flow tracers (rubidium-82 and nitrogen-13 ammonia) were injected retrogradely. Three hours after coronary occlusion, fluorine-18 (F-18) deoxyglucose uptake in the control and treatment groups was compared. At 200 min of occlusion, infarct size was assessed. Retrograde flow tracer uptake was observed in the risk zone in the seven intervention dogs. Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose uptake in the risk zone was increased in five of the six intervention dogs but was reduced in five of the six control dogs. The risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was higher in the intervention than the control group (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.51; p less than 0.05). The endocardial subsegment risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was also significantly higher in the intervention group. Percent infarction in the risk zone was 70% lower in the group treated with synchronized retroperfusion than in the control group (18.4 +/- 22.6% vs. 61.2 +/- 25.4%; p less than 0.02). Thus, positron emission tomography revealed that retroperfusion could deliver oxygenated blood and maintain metabolism in risk zone myocardium. Infarct size was limited to 30% of that of control. In acute closure of the left anterior descending coronary artery, synchronized retroperfusion might be considered for maintaining viability of the jeopardized myocardium if the artery cannot be reopened rapidly. 
Lamina repair and replacement to control laminectomy membrane formation in dogs. This study examined the efficacy of lamina repair by the use of various techniques to prevent postlaminectomy scar formation in a canine system. Five-level noncontiguous laminectomies were performed on six adult canines. The most caudal (Site 1) was left uncovered and served as the control. Exposed dura at each of the remaining four levels was covered with one of the following: Site 2, free autogenous laminar bone graft; Site 3, polymethylmethacrylate; Site 4, Teflon-Proplast composite; Site 5, collagen gel. The dogs used in the study were killed 16 weeks after surgery. Three specimens were examined by plain roentgenography and computerized tomography, two specimens were examined histologically, and the remaining four specimens were graded according to scar volume and scar adherence, as detected during gross dissection of the postlaminectomy scar. No repair technique interfered with roentgenography evaluation. The least scar and fewest adhesions were present under the free bone graft repair site. The Teflon-Proplast composite and polymethylmethacrylate both limited the amount and adherence of scar. Collagen gel and control sites were indistinguishable in this study. It is concluded that lamina repair with a solid material covering exposed dura significantly reduces the formation of postlaminectomy membrane and scar. 
2-D echocardiography: emergent use in the evaluation of penetrating precordial trauma. Diagnosis of cardiac injury in stable patients suffering penetrating precordial trauma has relied on observation, subxiphoid window, or exploratory thoracotomy. Previous reports have stressed the need for an alternative noninvasive diagnostic test. Although the use of echocardiography (ECHO) in this patient population has been suggested, to our knowledge no report thus far has presented extensive experience with this technique. We present our experience over 3 years with 36 patients in whom emergent ECHO was used as part of their initial work-up. Injuries included single stab wounds (17), multiple stab wounds (14), and gunshot wounds (5). Four patients (11%) had jugular venous distention, and 12 (33%) were tachycardic. None had a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Four ECHOs (11%) were positive for pericardial effusion. No valvular abnormalities were detected. Three of the effusions were small and these patients were triaged to monitored beds and observed. All three effusions resolved on serial echocardiography. The fourth patient underwent an uneventful operative repair of a left ventricular laceration. Although the yield is low, emergent 2-D ECHO is a valuable tool in the triage of stable penetrating trauma patients when cardiac injury is suspected. Patients without effusion can be discharged or triaged to a ward bed. Small effusions can be observed in a monitored setting with serial examinations, while large effusions should be treated surgically. Echocardiography is less expensive than ICU admission and less invasive than either subxiphoid window or thoracotomy. There are no known complications associated with the procedure and it is recommended for emergent use when available. 
Mechanisms involved in the response to prolonged infusion of atrial natriuretic factor in patients with chronic heart failure. We examined the mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular and renal response to prolonged infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in patients with chronic heart failure. ANF infusion was titrated to produce a 30% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or a 20% increase in cardiac output, and this dose (average, 75 +/- 4 ng/kg/min) was then administered for 20 hours. The short-term response to ANF included significant reductions in central filling pressures, increases in cardiac output, modest increases in diuresis and glomerular filtration rates, significant reduction in plasma aldosterone levels, and a 3.6-fold increase in plasma cyclic GMP levels. During prolonged infusion, plasma cGMP levels and cardiac output gradually returned to baseline. Similarly, the initially increased diuretic effects were completely abolished during prolonged ANF infusion, although plasma alpha-hANF levels remained consistently elevated above baseline values (control, 198 +/- 38; titration, 2,760 +/- 596; 20 hours, 3,499 +/- 659 pg/ml). Four hours after beginning the ANF infusion, marked increases in hematocrit levels were noted (42.5 +/- 1.0% versus 45.3 +/- 1.4%, control and infusion, respectively, p less than 0.05); during this time, no change in total plasma protein concentration occurred, indicating extravascular shift of fluid and plasma proteins. No evidence was noted for activation of vasoconstrictor hormones during prolonged ANF infusion, although mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced throughout the infusion period. Plasma pro-ANF (31-67) levels, determined as a marker for endogenous ANF secretion, were significantly suppressed as were the reductions of central filling pressures. After ANF discontinuation, heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly above baseline values without evidence for sympathetic stimulation. We conclude that 1) prolonged infusion of ANF causes only transient increases in plasma cGMP levels but a sustained reduction of the cardiac release of ANF and that 2) the beneficial hemodynamic effects of ANF, that is, unloading of the ventricles, may be associated with or, in part, may be secondary to a shift of plasma constituents into the extravascular space. The latter may limit the therapeutic potential of ANF for long-term treatment. 
Rhodococcus equi infection in the patient with AIDS: literature review and report of an unusual case. Rhodococcus equi is an aerobic, intracellular, gram-positive rod-coccus that is partially acid fast. The organism is primarily a pathogen in animals and has only rarely been seen in immunocompromised humans. Its most common manifestation is a slowly progressive pneumonia that may cavitate. Infections are thought to be acquired via respiratory exposure to animals or soil. R. equi infections are difficult to treat, usually requiring prolonged administration of parenteral antibiotics and often necessitating surgical drainage. A case of cavitary pneumonia and recurrent bacteremia with R. equi in a patient with AIDS is reported, and the current literature on R. equi infections in humans is reviewed. 
Cognitive laboratory approach to designing questionnaires for surveys of the elderly. Data from surveys of the elderly are used by policy analysts to design health services programs. Consequently, the quality of survey data on elderly respondents has important implications for this growing segment of society: improving the quality of data should result in more cost effective programs for the elderly. However, studies suggest that the quality of responses from the elderly may be less than that for other respondents. Moreover, the increasing needs of policy analysts and health researchers for data have resulted in more complex survey questions that place a high cognitive burden on respondents. New methods for improving the design of these questionnaires are needed. This project investigated whether new techniques of questionnaire design, adapted from the theories and methods of cognitive psychology, could be effectively used in interviewing older respondents. The techniques used in this study, concurrent think-aloud interviews with followup probe questions, have been shown recently to be effective with younger respondents. Problems that elderly respondents have in comprehending survey questions, retrieving relevant information from memory, and using decision processes to estimate and provide answers were investigated. Questions on functional ability and social support were taken from the 1984 Supplement on Aging to the National Health Interview Survey. Analysis of respondents' think-aloud protocols and responses to probes suggest that the cognitive interview procedures were effective in identifying problems with the survey questions that would result in data of poorer quality and in suggesting the wording of questions that would be likely to result in answers of greater validity and reliability. Implications of these results for survey design and validation studies are discussed. 
Vagal stimulation and prevention of sudden death in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. The interest for the antifibrillatory effect of vagal stimulation has been largely limited by the fact that this concept seemed restricted to acute experiments in anesthetized animals. To explore the potentially protective role of vagal stimulation in conscious animals we developed a chronically implantable device to be placed around the cervical right vagus. An anterior myocardial infarction was produced in 161 dogs; 1 month later an exercise stress test was performed on the 105 survivors. Toward the end of the test the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 minutes. Fifty-nine (56%) dogs developed ventricular fibrillation and, before this test was repeated, were assigned either to a control group (n = 24) or to be instrumented with the vagal device (n = 35). Five dogs were excluded because of electrode malfunction. Compared with the heart rate level attained after 30 seconds of occlusion during exercise in the control test, vagal stimulation led to a decrease of approximately 75 beats/min (from 255 +/- 33 to 170 +/- 36 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the control group 22 (92%) of 24 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during the second exercise and ischemia test. By contrast, during vagal stimulation ventricular fibrillation occurred in only 3 (10%) of the 30 dogs tested and recurred in 26 (87%) during an additional exercise and ischemia test in the control condition (p less than 0.001 versus the vagal stimulation test; internal control analysis). Combined analysis of the tests performed in the control condition showed that ventricular fibrillation was reproducible in 48 (89%) of the 54 dogs tested. The protective effect of vagal stimulation was also significant in the group comparison analysis and even after exclusion of those four dogs in which ventricular fibrillation was not reproducible (92% versus 11.5%, control versus vagal stimulation, p less than 0.001). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing, the vagally mediated protection was still significant (p = 0.015) as five (55%) of nine dogs survived the test. This study shows that vagal stimulation, performed shortly after the onset of an acute ischemic episode in conscious animals with a healed myocardial infarction, can effectively prevent ventricular fibrillation. This striking result seems to depend on multiple mechanisms having a synergistic action. The decrease in heart rate is an important but not always essential protective mechanism. The electrophysiological effects secondary to the vagally mediated antagonism of the sympathetic activity on the heart are likely to play a major role. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices in men with alcoholic liver disease. A randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial. The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Variceal Sclerotherapy Group. BACKGROUND. Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices in patients with alcoholic liver disease. It has also been suggested that sclerotherapy might be effective in preventing initial episodes of bleeding and improving survival among such patients. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing prophylactic sclerotherapy and sham therapy in 281 men with alcoholic liver disease who had at least three variceal channels and no history of variceal bleeding. All the patients underwent endoscopy; 143 received sclerotherapy, and 138 received sham therapy. RESULTS. The two patient groups were well matched at entry with respect to the extent of liver disease and other clinical indexes, except that other medical illnesses were significantly more common in the sclerotherapy group. The study's data-monitoring board terminated the trial 22.5 months after it began because the rate of mortality from all causes was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy group (32.2 percent) than in the sham-therapy group (17.4 percent, P = 0.004), despite the fact that the men who received sclerotherapy had significantly fewer episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. The causes of death varied, and there is no obvious explanation for the excess mortality in the sclerotherapy group. After the termination of treatment, the excess mortality rate in the sclerotherapy group promptly declined. There were 53 episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (including 10 from esophageal varices and 9 from esophageal ulcers) in the sclerotherapy group and 40 episodes (including 19 from esophageal varices) in the sham-therapy group. Complications of sclerotherapy were frequent but seldom life-threatening. CONCLUSIONS. For unknown reasons, prophylactic sclerotherapy is associated with increased mortality among men with moderate-to-severe alcoholic liver disease and esophageal varices. Sclerotherapy should not be performed until after an initial episode of bleeding from esophageal varices has occurred. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This article describes the first 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomies emphasizing the two-handed technique that is currently used at Marietta Surgical Center, Marietta, Georgia. This procedure has become primarily an outpatient procedure with resumption of normal activities in 7 days (including athletics). Two patients in this series had complications. One patients was converted to an open procedure because of a common duct injury. The other patient developed a biloma 2 weeks following surgery and recovered uneventfully following paracentesis on an outpatient basis. 
Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction. Recently, considerable effort has been directed toward the application of Doppler methods for detecting diastolic dysfunction. Recordings of transmitral filling velocity as obtained from pulsed-wave Doppler have been extensively investigated as a noninvasive method for determining left ventricular diastolic filling properties. Although Doppler parameters appear to reflect volumetric transmitral flow, close correlations with invasive descriptors of diastolic performance have not been found. Furthermore, Doppler transmitral velocities are sensitive to changes in ventricular preload, afterload, and heart rate. However, at least two distinct Doppler spectral patterns have been identified that are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation and restrictive physiology. Thus, Doppler recordings have proven to be of value in identifying the presence and type of diastolic dysfunction, and in the future they may be helpful in following the response to therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this paper is to review the available information relating Doppler transmitral recordings with catheterization and clinical descriptors of diastolic function. Additionally, the aim is to provide an understanding of the value and limitations of these noninvasive measurements in identifying and treating patients with diastolic abnormalities. 
The role of endoscopic papillotomy in ascending cholangitis. The role of endoscopic papillotomy in calculous cholangitis is unclear. A retrospective review of 41 patients admitted to hospital with calculous cholangitis was carried out. There were 30 women and 11 men and their ages ranged between 49 and 98 years (mean age 77). All patients presented with abdominal pain, tenderness, chills, and fever. Clinical jaundice was present in 95 per cent of the patients. Initial endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 17 of the 41 patients. In 24 patients cholangitis persisted or recurred and further therapy was carried out. Surgery was successful in controlling sepsis in ten of the 24 patients. Repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in four of 13 patients. Surgery was successful in one of nine patients who had failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. Nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in only two of nine patients. Six patients died after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. We conclude that initial endoscopic papillotomy should be attempted in patients with calculous cholangitis. Surgical exploration of the common bile duct should then be carried out if initial endoscopic papillotomy fails to control cholangitis. 
Feeding strategies for the dysphagic patient: a nursing perspective. The goal of treatment for the dysphagic patient is to maintain safe oral feeding. Achieving this goal requires an individualized care plan using selected feeding strategies. This care plan will need to be altered as changes in the patient's condition occur. 
Fibreoptic bronchoscopy without general anaesthetic. We have used flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy using sedation and local anaesthesia in 50 children aged 2-19 years (median 10) using an Olympus BFP20 instrument. Indications were opportunistic pneumonias (n = 11), persistent atelectasis (n = 11), recurrent pneumonia (n = 7), miscellaneous lower airway disease (n = 7), recurrent wheezing (n = 3), haemoptysis (3), to diagnose infection or rejection of heart-lung transplants (n = 3), stridor (n = 2), suspected airway compression (n = 1), evaluation of tracheostomy (n = 1), and suspected foreign body (n = 1). In 43 cases (86%) the diagnosis was related to the primary indication. In five (10%) unrelated abnormalities were found, and five (10%) were normal. In 13 (26%) treatment was altered as a result of flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Complications were transient respiratory arrest (n = 2), hypoxia (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), and laryngospasm (n = 1). All complications were followed by complete recovery. Our results suggest that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is safe. Advantages over rigid bronchoscopy include greater visual range, fewer complications, and the avoidance of a general anaesthetic. Though invasive it can yield important diagnostic and therapeutic information. 
Characterization of an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-4) produced by the B104 rat neuronal cell line: chemical and biological properties and differential synthesis by sublines. A previous report from our laboratory described an approximately 30 kilodalton (kDa) insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) that inhibited the binding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) by its receptor and was secreted by a subline of the B104 rat neuronal cell line. To better understand the biology of this IGFBP, it was purified from media conditioned by these B104 cells, and the chemical and biological properties of the protein were examined. The IGFBP existed as a 24 kDa form and a 28 kDa form when the conditioned media were analyzed by ligand blot. Deglycosylation studies indicated the 28 kDa species was the N-linked glycosylated form of the 24 kDa IGFBP. Multiple forms at both mol wts were found using two-dimensional electrophoresis, suggesting that there were posttranslational modifications in addition to glycosylation. The amino acid sequence of the 12 amino-terminal residues was identical to that of rat IGFBP-4. Increased synthesis of IGFBP-4 by the subline contrasted with neglible production by other B104 cells. Blot hybridization with rat IGFBP-4 complementary DNA showed differential expression of a 2.6 kilobase transcript among B104 cell lines that correlated with quantities of IGFBP-4 secreted in media. The difference persisted even when the cells were xenografted into athymic nude mice. Purified IGFBP-4 inhibited the binding of [125I]IGF-I by its receptor and blunted stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation by IGF-I. These findings suggest a role for IGFBP-4 in neural cell function and indicate the B104 cell lines may be a useful model for further examination of IGFBP-4 biology. 
Phase III comparison of doxorubicin and dacarbazine given by bolus versus infusion in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Disseminated soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of uncommon malignancies generally treated in a uniform manner. This study questioned the impact of schedule on response rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma treated with the two-drug combination doxorubicin and dacarbazine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bolus therapy with doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (118 patients) or infusional therapy with doxorubicin at 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at 750 mg/m2 delivered by continuous intravenous infusion for 96 hours on days 1-4 (122 patients). Chemotherapy was to be repeated every 3 weeks. A unique feature of this cooperative group protocol was a provision for surgical resection of residual disease in patients with a partial response or with stable disease following chemotherapy. Similar overall response rates (17% in both treatment arms) and complete response rates (5% in both treatment arms) were observed. For patients receiving bolus therapy, the median response duration was 19.6 months for those in complete remission and 6.6 months for those in partial remission. For patients receiving infusional therapy, the median response duration was 12.6 months for those in complete remission and 9.3 months for those in partial remission. Examination of dose intensity received when combining treatment arms revealed a weak doxorubicin dose-response relationship. There was no difference in median survival times between the two treatment arms (bolus therapy, 10.6 months; infusional therapy, 10.5 months; logrank P = .97). Analysis of toxic effects favored infusional therapy. Significant reductions in cardiac toxicity (all events, P = .04; clinical events, P = .01) and nausea and emesis (P = .04) were seen in infusional therapy. Of 47 patients eligible for cytoreductive surgery following chemotherapy, 12 received surgery, and of those 12, eight were rendered disease free. The use of a 96-hour continuous intravenous infusion of doxorubicin-dacarbazine was comparable therapeutically with bolus dosing of these two agents and was better tolerated by the patients. 
Association between antiphospholipid antibodies and cardiac abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. PURPOSE: Although the antiphospholipid antibodies are well recognized to be associated with thrombosis, recurrent abortion, and thrombocytopenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their relationship with cardiac disease is less clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between anti-phospholipid antibodies and cardiac abnormalities in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 consecutive SLE patients and 60 healthy sex- and age-matched control subjects were evaluated in a case-control study. All participants underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography. Antiphospholipid antibodies levels were assayed in each patient. The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with and without echocardiographic abnormalities was compared. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, SLE patients had significantly more pericardial abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular dysfunction and verrucous valvular thickening, global valvular thickening with dysfunction, and mitral and aortic regurgitation. Among these abnormalities, antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly associated with isolated left ventricular (global or segmental) dysfunction (four of five positive; p less than 0.05), verrucous valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening (seven of nine positive; p less than 0.005), global valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening and dysfunction (five of six positive; p less than 0.02), as well as mitral regurgitation (16 of 19 positive; p less than 0.001) and aortic regurgitation (five of six positive; p less than 0.02). CONCLUSION: Valvular lesions and myocardial dysfunction are associated with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies. This study has important implications for the pathogenic role of anti-phospholipid antibodies in relation to these cardiac abnormalities. 
Mitochondrial encephalopathies: molecular genetic diagnosis from blood samples. Point mutations of mitochondrial DNA have been described in the muscle of patients with syndromes of myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibres (MERRF) and of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We have found the MERRF mutation in members of 6 British kindreds; 2 of these had unusual phenotypes but all index patients had myoclonus. The MELAS mutation was detected in 17 patients from 16 families, who had a wide range of clinical features that particularly affected the central nervous system; stroke-like episodes were observed in 10.3 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations did not have ragged red fibres on muscle biopsy, generally considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. In all 6 patients with the MERRF mutation, and 10 of 11 with the MELAS mutation, the genetic defect was easily detected in blood cells as well as muscle (blood samples were not available in 6 patients with MELAS mutations in muscle). Molecular genetic analysis of blood samples represents an inexpensive and reliable screening test for mitochondrial encephalopathies, and use of such techniques could influence diagnosis and genetic counselling in patients with seizure disorders and young-onset stroke. 
Pyroelectric vidicon thermography and cold challenge quantify the severity of Raynaud's phenomenon. Thermographic images of the hands of patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and of a group of normal subjects, recorded before and after cold provocation using a pyroelectric vidicon thermal imaging system, showed differences in thermal distribution patterns that were characteristic of primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), scleroderma (RS) and normal, and were exaggerated by cold provocation. The responses to cold challenge, assessed by computing the mean temperature of the hand as it recovered from cold challenge and plotting these values against time to produce a rewarming curve, were also characteristic of the patient and the normal groups, and gave an indication of the severity of circulatory impairment. Methods are described for the simple numerical characterization of these parameters. 
The low risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients dispensed corticosteroids. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with corticosteroids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was assessed in a cohort of 19,880 patients from the Michigan Medicaid billing database with dermatitis and/or asthma treated with corticosteroids during 1980 to 1984. The frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed within 60 days after each corticosteroid prescription. RESULTS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were exposed to corticosteroids was only 2.8 cases per 10,000 person-months. The rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was notably higher in patients receiving anticoagulants and those with a prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23.0 and 15.9 cases per 10,000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Because the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ambulatory patients treated with corticosteroids is so low, prophylactic therapy should be restricted to high-risk patients, if it is to be used at all. 
Caseating cutaneous granulomas in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia. A 34-year-old man with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, bronchiectasis, and chronic liver disease had a papular eruption on the trunk and upper extremities. A biopsy specimen revealed caseating granulomas, but special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy failed to reveal an infectious organism. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphocytes within the granulomas were almost exclusively of the CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the circulating lymphocytes showed normal numbers of CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD8+ T cells, whereas B cells were undetectable. Other examples of noninfectious granulomatous disease have been reported in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, but this is the first case of caseating cutaneous granulomatous disease to be reported in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia. 
High risk of human papillomavirus infection and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions among women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. We investigated the relationship of human papillomavirus (by cervicovaginal lavage and Southern blot), human immunodeficiency virus, and squamous intraepithelial lesions in 96 high-risk women in the Bronx, New York. Antibodies for human immunodeficiency virus were detected in 51 (53%) women. Of the 33 women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, 23 (70%) had human papillomavirus infection compared with 4 of 18 (22%) asymptomatic women who were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and 10 of 45 (22%) uninfected women (p less than 0.0001). The rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions was 52% (14 of 27) for women with both viruses detected, 18% (6 of 34) for women with either virus detected, and 9% (3 of 35) for uninfected women. Among symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, a strong association between human papillomavirus infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions was demonstrated (odds ratio, 12; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 108). Risk was highest for younger women from ethnic or racial minority groups. Advanced human immunodeficiency virus-related disease, with its associated immunosuppression, seems to exacerbate human papillomavirus-mediated cervical cytologic abnormalities. Public health measures are needed to provide Papanicolaou smear screening and appropriate clinical follow-up and treatment for women at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
The effect of the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis on renal blood flow in fetal sheep. Treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has been associated with oligohydramnios in the fetus. The presumed mechanism is a reduction in fetal renal blood flow. We examined the effect of meclofenamate administration on renal blood flow in chronically catheterized fetal sheep during normoxia and during moderate and severe hypoxia. Ten fetal sheep were made hypoxic twice at least 4 days after surgery: once in the presence and once in the absence of meclofenamate infusion. Renal blood flow and combined ventricular output were measured with radioactive microspheres. Prostaglandin synthesis blockade with meclofenamate caused no significant change in blood pressure, combined ventricular output, renal blood flow, or renal vascular resistance in either the normoxic or hypoxic animals. These data challenge the contention that prostaglandin activity protects the renal vascular bed of the fetus from vasoconstriction during hypoxia and they also do not support the hypothesis that prostaglandin synthesis inhibition causes oligohydramnios through reduction of fetal renal blood flow. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma of the male genitalia: management with radiation therapy. Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia is an infrequent complication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but it often is difficult to manage. A total of 19 men (mean age 39 years) with penile and/or scrotal lesions underwent radiotherapy at dosages of 600 to 3,000 cGy. in fractions of 150 to 800 cGy. Of the patients 6 achieved a complete and 10 a partial response, while 2 had no response and 1 died too soon after treatment to be evaluated. Recurrences were noted in 8 patients, 7 of whom received additional radiation (1 patient had 2 recurrences and both responded). Of the retreatments 3 effected complete and 4 partial responses. Over-all, of 25 evaluable treatment courses 9 complete (36%) and 14 partial (56%) responses yielded a total response rate of 92%. There was 1 complication, a skin ulceration. Radiation therapy is well tolerated and will result in effective palliation in the majority of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia. 
Imaging the pleura: sonography, CT, and MR imaging. A variety of imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the pleura and the pleural space. Standard radiographs are the most common. In this article, however, we review the use of three other imaging techniques: sonography, CT, and MR imaging. Sonography allows easy identification of pleural fluid and loculation and differentiation from pleural masses; CT is best for characterizing location and composition of pleural masses; MR is somewhat limited, but is best for imaging superior sulcus carcinoma. 
Bowel perforation and interstitial cystitis in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. A 13-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain, fever, dysuria, incontinence and pyuria and was subsequently diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with extensive gastrointestinal involvement and an associated interstitial cystitis. Despite aggressive therapy with high dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide she developed a small bowel perforation and subsequently died. The combination of bowel symptoms and interstitial cystitis seems unique to the population with SLE, while the separate complication of bowel perforation carries an extremely poor prognosis in this group of patients. 
Retinoid-induced ear malformations. Treatment of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats with retinoic acid or etretinate pregnancy day 8.5 to 9.0 resulted in craniofacial defects in 100% of the embryos. A morphologic investigation of the malformations occurring in the ear was performed. Outer ears were missing, microtic, low-placed, and dorsally situated. External acoustic meatus was short or absent. Middle ear structures were delayed in differentiation, middle ear ossicle primordia were hypoplastic and malformed, the stapedial artery and facial nerve were hypoplastic, and their relation to the stapes was variable. In the inner ear, the otic capsule was thick, the cochlea had fewer turns and the semicircular ducts showed poor differentiation. 
Increased survival, limb preservation, and prognostic factors for osteosarcoma. Preoperative intraarterial (IA) cisplatin (CDP) was administered to 92 patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. The ages of the patients ranged from 4 to 28 years. Sixty-four patients (70%) received 2 or 3 preoperative courses and 28 (30%) received 4 or more. Sixty-two specimens were available for pathologic examination to assess the degree of tumor necrosis. More than 90% tumor destruction was observed in 16 of 42 patients (38%) who received 1 to 3 preoperative courses as opposed to 17 of 20 (85%) who received 4 or more courses. Patients who received 4 or more courses had a 2-fold probability of achieving more than 90% tumor necrosis, and 68% underwent conservative surgery. Of those who received 3 or less courses, 23% underwent conservative surgery. Postoperatively, patients were treated with intravenous (IV) CDP alternating with doxorubicin (ADR) (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Pulmonary metastases developed in 36 patients, bone metastases in 2, and local recurrence in 6. Two patients died of cardiac failure without evidence of disease. Thus, 46 patients (50%) were continuously free of disease 18 to 78 months after diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that male sex, low grade preoperative chemotherapy-induced necrosis, and nonosteoblastic histologic condition were prognostic factors predictive of recurrence, while male sex and large tumor size were prognostic factors predictive of death. These results are comparable with those reported by other centers and are superior to our previous experiences that yielded survival rates of 5% to 10%. A substantial number of patients also had the opportunity to achieve tumor removal with conservative surgery. 
Effect of caffeine on ibuprofen analgesia in postoperative oral surgery pain. Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeine acts as an analgesic adjuvant when combined with acetaminophen, aspirin, or their mixture. Our objective was to determine whether similar enhancement of analgesia could be demonstrated when caffeine is combined with ibuprofen. On a double-blind basis, a single oral dose of ibuprofen (50, 100, or 200 mg), a combination of ibuprofen, 100 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, a combination of ibuprofen, 200 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, or placebo was randomly assigned to 298 outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars. With a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 8 hours. All active treatments were significantly superior to placebo, and the caffeine effect was significant for every measure of analgesia. Relative potency estimates indicated that the combination was 2.4 to 2.8 times as potent as ibuprofen alone. The combination also had a more rapid onset and longer duration of analgesic action. The analgesic adjuvancy of caffeine clearly extends to combinations with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than acetaminophen or aspirin. 
Reduction of myocardial infarction after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting for failed coronary angioplasty with use of a normothermic reperfusion cardioplegia protocol. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting is necessary in 2.7% to 13.5% of patients undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Myocardial infarction develops in 11% to 49% of these patients, with 18% to 46% of infarcts resulting in new Q waves. Since February 1987 a revised protocol for myocardial preservation has been used in 19 patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty. Cardioplegia is induced with a normothermic blood cardioplegic solution. Multiple maintenance doses of cold (4 degrees C) blood cardioplegic solution are then delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. Before the aortic crossclamp is removed, normothermic reperfusion cardioplegic solution is delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. This group was compared with all patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty before February 1987. These 45 patients received cold induction of cardioplegic solution, multiple maintenance doses of cold cardioplegic solution, and no reperfusion cardioplegic solution. The prevalence of myocardial infarction in the group receiving cold cardioplegic solution was 65% versus 26% in the group receiving normothermic cardioplegic solution (p less than 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified the use of the normothermic cardioplegia protocol (p less than 0.005), nontotal occlusion of the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.03), and presence of collateral flow to the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.04) as being independently associated with absence of myocardial infarction. 
A prospective study of hospitalization with gallstone disease among women: role of dietary factors, fasting period, and dieting. BACKGROUND: Dietary risk factors for the development of gallstones have not been clearly established. We analyzed data from a population-based prospective study to determine dietary risk factors for hospitalization with gallstone disease. METHODS: We evaluated the role of dietary constituents, fasting, and dieting on subsequent hospitalization with gallstone disease among 4,730 women, ages 25 to 74 years, who participated in the first follow-up of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Baseline dietary variables were established through a 24-hour dietary recall and a medical history. Proportional hazards models were used to calculate the effects of dietary variables while controlling for baseline risk factors. RESULTS: After an average of 10 years follow-up, gallstone disease was confirmed by hospital records among 216 women who denied gallstone disease at the baseline examination. The hazard rate of hospitalization with gallstone disease increased with increasing overnight fasting period and with dieting. Intake of fiber showed a small protective effect. The effect of energy intake was significant only among women younger than age 50 years at baseline. Results were not affected by adjustment for known risk factors for gallstone disease or other dietary factors. CONCLUSION: A long overnight fasting period, dieting, and low fiber intake may increase the risk of hospitalization with gallstone disease. 
Helicobacter pylori in children with peptic ulcer and their families. Little is known about the source and spread of Helicobacter pylori, but transmission from infected family contacts has been suggested. We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H. pylori. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured. Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing. Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H. pylori. Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H. pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H. pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively). The children with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001). The reliability of serum anti-H. pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed. These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H. pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs. 
Does body posture affect the incidence and mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux? We studied eight patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease to compare the frequency and mechanism of reflux in the upright and supine positions. Simultaneous oesophageal manometry and pH studies were performed on two separate days in each subject in the fasting and postprandial periods. The frequency of reflux tended to be higher in the upright position. The most prevalent mechanism of reflux in either position was transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was higher in the upright than in the supine position. There was no difference in the total reflux time, acid clearance time, and number of reflux episodes lasting longer than five minutes in the two positions. We suggest that daytime reflux (upright) may be as important as night time (supine) reflux in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis and needs to be considered when treating patients with reflux disease. 
Association between infection with Helicobacter pylori and risk of gastric cancer: evidence from a prospective investigation. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the association between gastric cancer and prior infection with Helicobacter pylori. DESIGN--Case-control comparison of prevalence of IgG antibodies to H pylori in blood samples collected prospectively, before diagnosis of gastric cancer in the cases. Presence of H pylori antibody (greater than 10 micrograms IgG/ml) determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SUBJECTS--29 men with a subsequent diagnosis of gastric cancer and 116 aged matched controls selected from over 22,000 middle aged men participating in two ongoing cohort studies (the British United Provident Association study and the Caerphilly collaborative heart disease study), who had provided blood samples during 1975-1982. RESULTS--20 of the 29 cases (69%) and 54 of the 116 controls (47%) were positive for H pylori specific antibody. The median specific IgG concentration was significantly higher in the cases than controls (90 micrograms/ml v 3.6 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.01). The estimated odds ratio for the risk of gastric cancer in those with a history of infection with H pylori was 2.77 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 7.97, 2p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS--H pylori infection may be an important cause of gastric cancer; between 35% and 55% of all cases may be associated with such an infection. 
Temporal profiles of urinary excretion of NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity in humans. We studied the temporal profile of urinary NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity (NT G-34-IR) excretion in order to evaluate the dynamics of gastrin secretion. The temporal profile of urinary NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects represented three peaks corresponding to each meal. In contrast, the profile in antrectomized patients and patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represented a flat pattern. Urinary NT G-34-IR excretions during fasting 2-h periods in antrectomized patients and TPN patients were about one-sixth and one-third, respectively, of basal NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects (53.1 +/- 13.9 pmol/h). Total urinary NT G-34-IR excretion during 24 h both in antrectomized patients (220 +/- 35 pmol/24 h) and TPN patients (390 +/- 68 pmol/24 h) was also significantly lower than in normal subjects (1985 +/- 403 pmol/24 h). The present study showed that the main source of urinary NT G-34-IR is the gastric antrum, that the main factor fluctuating its excretion is food intake, and that long-term TPN reduces basal gastrin secretion. Urinary NT G-34-IR would be a useful indicator for total gastrin secretion. 
Myringoplasty in children. This series examines the results of myringoplasty in children using the overlay technique. Controversy still surrounds the issue of proper timing of surgery on the basis of preoperative assessment of tubal function. Results of this technique in children, using contralateral ear status as the primary predictor of success, found an overall success rate of 78%. Age appears to be a significant factor because children 10 years old and younger were found to have a higher incidence of surgical failures. 
Evolution of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT and brain mapping in a patient presenting with echolalia and palilalia. A 78-yr-old woman presented with transient echolalia and palilalia. She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for 2 yr. Routine laboratory examination showed hypotonic hyponatremia, but was otherwise unremarkable. Brain mapping revealed a bifrontal delta focus, more pronounced on the right. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with technetium-99m labeled d,l hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO), performed during the acute episode showed relative frontoparietal hypoactivity. Brain mapping performed after disappearance of the echolalia and palilalia, which persisted only for 1 day, was normal. By contrast, SPECT findings persisted for more than 3 wk. Features of particular interest in the presented patient are the extensive defects seen on brain SPECT despite the absence of morphologic lesions, the congruent electrophysiologic changes and their temporal relationship with the clinical evolution. 
Atrial natriuretic polypeptide inhibits hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Vascular remodeling is central to the pathophysiology of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Recent evidence suggests that vasoconstrictive substances, such as angiotensin II (AII), may function as a vascular smooth muscle growth promoting substance. To explore the role of the counterregulatory hormone, atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in this process, we examined the effect of ANP (alpha-rat ANP [1-28]) on the growth characteristics of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. ANP (10(-7) M) significantly suppressed the proliferative effect of 1% and 5% serum as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell number, confirming ANP as an antimitogenic factor. In quiescent RASM cells, ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) significantly suppressed the basal incorporations of 3H-uridine and leucine by 50 and 30%, respectively. ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) also suppressed AII-induced RNA and protein syntheses (by 30-40%) with the concomitant reduction of the cell size. Furthermore, ANP also significantly attenuated the increase of 3H-uridine and leucine incorporations caused by transforming growth factor-beta (4 x 10(-11), 4 x 10(-10) M), a potent hypertrophic factor. These results indicate that ANP possesses an antihypertrophic action on vascular smooth muscle cells. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by 24-h treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not inhibit ANP-induced suppression on 3H-uridine incorporation. Based on the observation that ANP was more potent than a ring-deleted analogue of ANP on inhibiting 3H-uridine incorporation, we conclude that the ANP's inhibitory effect is primarily mediated via the activation of a guanylate cyclase-linked ANP receptor(s). Indeed 8-bromo cGMP mimicked the antihypertrophic action of ANP. Accordingly, we speculate that in addition to its vasorelaxant and natriuretic effects, the antihypertrophic action of ANP observed in the present study may serve as an additional compensatory mechanism of ANP in hypertension. 
Combination chemotherapy for advanced adenocarcinoma of the cervix. A patient with advanced adenocarcinoma of the cervix was treated only with cisplatin and mitomycin C (MMC). The regimen achieved a complete response, confirmed by chest radiograph and computed axial tomography scan, lasting 50 months. The patient is alive with recurrent disease 59 months after diagnosis. No severe drug-related toxicity occurred. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Routine programmed electrical stimulation in survivors of acute myocardial infarction for prediction of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up: results, optimal stimulation protocol and cost-effective screening Of 3,286 consecutive patients treated for acute myocardial infarction, electrophysiologic testing was performed in 1,209 survivors (37%) free of significant complications at the time of hospital discharge to determine their risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in 75 (6.2%). Antiarrhythmic therapy was not routinely prescribed regardless of the test results. During the 1st year of follow-up, 14 infarct survivors (19%) with inducible ventricular tachycardia experienced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in the absence of new ischemia compared with 34 (2.9%) of those without inducible ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.0005). During the extended follow-up period (median 28 months) of those with inducible ventricular tachycardia, 19 (25%) had a spontaneous electrical event; 37% of these first events were fatal. These results suggest that the most cost-effective strategy for predicting arrhythmia will be obtained by restricting electrophysiologic testing to infarct survivors whose left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40% and using a stimulation protocol containing four extrastimuli. Electrophysiologic testing is the single best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up in infarct survivors. The majority (94%) with a negative test benefit from the more reliable reassurance that all is well, whereas the 25% risk of electrical events in those with inducible ventricular tachycardia justifies a prospective trial of effective prophylactic antiarrhythmic interventions. 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Abdominal wall tenderness: a useful sign in chronic abdominal pain. The outcome in 72 patients with obscure abdominal pain and a positive Carnett's (abdominal wall tenderness) test, seen in one firm's surgical outpatient clinic between 1975 and 1983, was sought by a combination of hospital note retrieval and general practitioner questionnaire. Full follow-up data to date or death were available for 58 (81 per cent) patients and partial follow-up for 14 patients. The study showed that the patients generated a good deal of investigation and a number of surgical procedures but that seldom were their symptoms attributable to serious pathology. Familiarity with the test, taken in the context of a proper history and examination, has been found helpful in assessing such patients and saves the inconvenience, expense and occasional hazard of investigation, and even surgery. 
Characteristics of cirrhosis undiagnosed during life: a comparative analysis of 73 undiagnosed cases and 149 diagnosed cases of cirrhosis, detected in 4929 consecutive autopsies. In 4929 consecutive autopsies performed during a period of 4 years, 222 cases (4.5%) of cirrhosis were found, of which 149 (3%) were detected while the patients were alive (diagnosed cirrhosis) and 73 (1.5%) were not detected while the patients were living (undiagnosed cirrhosis). Fifty-three of the 73 undiagnosed patients appeared to be completely without signs of cirrhosis (silent cirrhosis). In the diagnosed group, 70% of patients died from hepatic causes, in contrast to 16% in the undiagnosed group. At autopsy, the following complications of cirrhosis were found more frequently in the diagnosed group than in the undiagnosed group: ascites (41% vs. 8%), oesophageal varices (44% vs. 10%), splenomegaly (52% vs. 29%). The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly in the two groups (12% vs. 8%). It is concluded that cirrhosis without obvious signs occurs relatively frequently, and that no sensitive non-invasive screening methods are available at present. 
Cerebrovascular accident complicating acute myocardial infarction: incidence, clinical significance and short- and long-term mortality rates. The SPRINT Study Group. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, the antecedents, and the clinical significance of clinically recognized cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA-TIA) complicating acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1981 to 1983, a secondary prevention study with nifedipine (SPRINT) was conducted in 14 hospitals in Israel among 2,276 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the study, demographic, historical, and medical data were collected on special forms for all patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction in 13 of these 14 hospitals (the SPRINT registry, n = 5,839). Mortality follow-up was completed for 99% of hospital survivors for a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range: 4.5 to 7 years). RESULTS: The incidence of CVA-TIA was 0.9% (54 of 5,839). The latter rate increased significantly only with age, from 0.4% among patients up to 59 years old to 1.6% among those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Multivariate analysis identified age, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke as predictors of CVA-TIA during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Patients with CVA-TIA exhibited a complicated hospital course, with a 15-day mortality rate of 41%. Subsequent mortality rates in survivors at 1 and 5 years were 34% and 59%, respectively. Rates at the same time points in patients without CVA-TIA were 16%, 11%, and 29% (p less than 0.01). In a multivariate analysis that included age, gender, congestive heart failure, history of previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension, CVA-TIA was independently associated with increased 15-day mortality (covariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 4.32), as well as subsequent 1-year (OR = 3.29; 90% CI, 1.70 to 6.36) and long-term (mean follow-up = 5.5 years) mortality (OR = 2.46; 90% CI, 1.30 to 4.69). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction, CVA-TIA was a relatively infrequent complication of acute myocardial infarction. Factors independently favoring the occurrence of CVA-TIA were old age, previous CVA, and congestive heart failure. CVA-TIA occurring during acute myocardial infarction independently increased the risk of early death threefold as well as the risk of long-term mortality in early-phase survivors. (2.5-fold). 
The inheritance of alcohol consumption patterns in a general population twin sample: I. Multidimensional scaling of quantity/frequency data. Quantity/frequency data on alcohol consumption were obtained by mailed questionnaire from 2,903 same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic Australian twin pairs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was applied to these data. A three-dimensional solution was required to account for the observed pattern of twin concordances for alcohol consumption. These results suggest separate determination of abstinence, frequency of consumption and quantity consumed when drinking, rather than inheritance of a single continuum of overall consumption level. 
In-flight esophageal variceal bleeding en route for liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. Esophageal variceal bleeding owing to portal hypertension is a potential threat in pediatric patients awaiting liver transplantation. We report a case of a three-year-old boy with severe congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli's disease, and portal hypertension who developed a life-threatening variceal hemorrhage for the first time in his life during commercial air transport to a liver transplantation center. Factors precipitating variceal bleeding are discussed, particularly those resulting from changes in altitude. It is recommended that prophylactic treatment for variceal bleeding be at least considered in children awaiting liver transplantation prior to prolonged air transportation. Because of differences in capabilities of treatment providers in various locales, and because there are as yet no conclusive data, the treatment of choice must be decided on an individual basis. Equipment for treating in-flight hemorrhage should be available. 
Leiomyosarcoma of the trachea. Case report. Leiomyosarcoma of the trachea is a rare primary tumor of the upper airway. Twelve cases have been reported in the English-language literature. Our experience with a patient with leiomyosarcoma of the cervical trachea is presented. The classic symptoms, diagnosis, and surgical management of this case are contrasted with those of the previously reported cases. The surgical technique used for our patient, primary tumor resection with skin grafting and placement of a Montgomery Laryngeal Stent, is a unique and effective treatment. 
Midterm follow-up of young patients fused in situ for spondylolisthesis. To evaluate the results of posterolateral fusion alone (66 patients) and combined posterolateral and anterior fusion (39 patients) in situ, 105 consecutive patients younger than 25 years of age with spondylolisthesis, retrospectively were examined clinically and radiologically. The follow-up rate was 98% after a mean of 8.2 years (range, 2.0-15.3). Pre- and postoperative progression of slip was rare (6% and 1%, respectively), and no prognostic factors were found. The definite pseudarthrosis rate was 6%. In patients with low- and high-grade slip, 67% and 88% (respectively) were satisfied at follow-up, suggesting that the indication for operative treatment in patients with low-grade slip is relative. 
Radioimmunoassay of insulin-like growth factors in cyst fluid of central nervous system tumors. Tumor cells are characterized by abnormalities in growth and metabolism, including the autocrine secretion of certain growth factors. The authors have previously shown the presence of insulin-like growth factor receptors in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and in this study examine whether CNS tumors are capable of autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factors in situ. To investigate the production of insulin-like growth factors I and II by CNS tumors, the authors have developed specific radioimmunoassays for these growth factors. In situ production of insulin-like growth factors was studied by immunoassay of CNS tumor cyst fluid aspirated at the time of surgery from 12 cystic tumors: seven primary brain tumors, four metastatic tumors, and one spinal schwannoma. For immunoassay, cyst fluid was treated overnight with acetic acid, then insulin-like growth factors were separated from binding proteins by a refined solid-phase technique, then dried and reconstituted in immunoassay buffer. Normal human serum and cerebrospinal fluid served as controls. Insulin-like growth factor I was detected in all 12 tumors studied. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor II was detected only in three low-grade astrocytomas, the spinal schwannoma (which had the highest insulin-like growth factor II level of all tumors studied), and three metastatic lung cancers. These results suggest that CNS tumors may be capable of autocrine production of insulin-like growth factors in situ. Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the type of insulin-like growth factors produced by different types of CNS tumors. Preferential production of insulin-like growth factors may be an important marker of tumor differentiation and useful as a diagnostic tool. 
Cardiac angiosarcoma with ruptured right atrium diagnosed by echocardiography. A 41-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of right-sided chest pain. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination revealed a ruptured right atrium and a localized pericardial effusion. Color Doppler echocardiography and contrast echocardiography showed blood flow from the right atrium into pericardial effusion, which was confirmed at emergency surgery. The pathologic specimen from the right atrium showed a spindle cell angiosarcoma. 
Experimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging. Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules. 
Histology of aural polyp as a predictor of middle ear disease activity. This study compares the histology of aural polyp with the subsequent clinical course of the middle ear disease. All cases of aural polyps that presented to the department during 1988 and 1989 were included. Patients who had previous ear surgery were excluded as were cases where the operation was part of clearance of known cholesteatoma rather than polypectomy alone. We found that the histology of the aural polyp was not a precise predictor of the presence or absence of cholesteatoma, nor of the subsequent course of the middle ear disease. 
Effect of dialysis membrane and patient's age on signs of dialysis-related amyloidosis. The Working Party on Dialysis Amyloidosis. This 12 center study was designed to assess factors affecting the development and progression of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis in long-term dialysis. A total of 221 patients who were on hemodialysis for more than five years, and who were treated the entire time only with AN69, a biocompatible, highly permeable membrane, or cuprophane, a less permeable, poorly biocompatible membrane (Cell) were evaluated for time on dialysis, development of carpal tunnel syndrome, and cystic bone lesions. X-ray documentation was taken in a minimum of four of the six following joints: both hips, wrists and shoulders. The data demonstrate that patients treated solely by AN69 membranes display signs of bone amyloidosis less frequently than do those treated by Cell membranes. Age at onset of dialysis was found to have a striking correlation with the development of carpal tunnel syndrome and bone amyloidosis, while no significant influence was found for hyperparathyroidism, sex or year of first dialysis. 
Color Doppler sonography in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction: patterns of temporal response to papaverine. Most studies of duplex Doppler sonography for the assessment of erectile dysfunction involve determination of peak systolic velocities 5 min after intracavernosal injection of papaverine. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the timing of Doppler measurements of flow after papaverine injection for establishing the presence of arterial and venous abnormalities. Color Doppler sonography was performed in 75 patients for evaluation of vasculogenic impotence. After intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine, measurements of peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were obtained in each cavernosal artery at 5-min intervals for a total of 30 min. A peak systolic velocity of less than 25 cm/sec was used as the threshold for arterial insufficiency. An end-diastolic velocity of greater than 5 cm/sec was used to predict venous incompetence. Scanning was performed for direct assessment of dorsal venous flow. Thirty patients were subsequently evaluated by cavernosometry and cavernosography. In most patients (76%), maximum response to papaverine was achieved within the first 5 min. In eight patients, significant increases in systolic velocity were seen only after 5 min. In 10 patients, significant changes in end-diastolic velocity between 5 and 30 min resulted in diagnostic reclassification. Data acquisition for 30 min significantly improved the sensitivity (95%) and specificity (83%) for the prediction of venous incompetence in patients with correlative cavernosography. Transient, early dorsal vein flow was noted in normal subjects. Persistent dorsal vein flow had an 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for venous incompetence. Our results suggest that, when using color Doppler sonography, gathering data for 30 min may improve the prediction of vasculogenic impotence. 
Total coronary occlusion: a different animal? Provided collateralization is adequate, a chronic total coronary occlusion clinically imitates a 90% stenosis but is exempt from the risk of myocardial infarction. For angioplasty of vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion, technical difficulties and clinical risks are balanced against projected subjective benefit and amount of viable myocardium concerned. The primary success rate is approximately 65% and complications are rare because abrupt vessel reclosure may be common but is harmless. New Q wave infarction in that context has not been reported. The duration of occlusion is the most important predictor of success. The length of the occluded segment is also important. Recurrence averages 68% (21% reocclusion and 47% restenosis) and happens typically within 6 months. The high recurrence rate is due to competitive pressure exerted by collateral vessels and an often suboptimal local result. Even if the primary success rate of angioplasty in vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion can be improved by advanced technology and skill, the clinical yield will remain low compared with that of angioplasty of stenoses. Because low yield procedures must be low risk and low cost, there are definite limits to how sophisticated, risky and expensive new techniques can become. Derivatives of conventional balloon systems are likely to remain the equipment of first choice, perhaps complemented by mechanical drills. Although chronic total coronary occlusions are no clinical menace in contrast to stenoses, they frequently deserve revascularization and are the reason to select bypass surgery over angioplasty. These factors justify endeavors to improve recanalization techniques that help to refine coronary angioplasty of nontotal lesions, because total occlusion, albeit a different animal, is of the same species. 
Chronic abacterial prostatitis and hyperthermia. A possible new treatment? A group of 45 patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis or prostatodynia underwent 6 weekly, 1-hour sessions of local deep microwave hyperthermia (42.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) to the prostate. All patients had a long history of symptoms typical of the condition. They all failed to respond to a variety of conventional treatments administered over several years by various specialists. Each patient served as his own control before and after the hyperthermic treatment. The results of this study are encouraging: 25% showed a sustained and complete loss of symptoms and 50% had a partial response; the remaining 25% reported no improvement. These results open up new possibilities in the treatment of this condition, which has so far responded poorly to conventional therapy. 
Clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias. The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias and to assess the major sources of error related to the management of two tachydysrhythmias: atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. In this descriptive study, 142 critical care nurses each completed four computerized clinical simulations (two atrial flutter and two ventricular tachycardia). Simulation performance was measured by proficiency score (comparison with expert performance), patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected before the first intervention. Mean proficiency scores were 51% for atrial flutter and 35% for ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35% of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death. Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources of error. Medication errors were the cause of death in 87% of the simulations ending in patient death. These results document the need for emphasis on dysrhythmia management in the critical care curriculum. 
Quadrantic visual field defects. A hallmark of lesions in extrastriate (V2/V3) cortex. We report 2 patients with homonymous quadrantic visual field defects. The first patient experienced scintillations in the left lower quadrant, leading to the discovery of an astrocytoma in the cuneus of the right occipital lobe. Postoperatively she had a left lower quadrantanopia that precisely respected the horizontal meridian. The second patient presented with a left lower quadrantanopia, sparing the central 10 degrees of vision that also respected the horizontal meridian. An astrocytoma was resected from the right upper peristriate cortex. We must explain how a lesion in extrastriate cortex produced a homonymous field defect with a sharp horizontal edge in these 2 patients. Areas V2 and V3 are each divided along the horizontal meridian into separate halves flanking striate cortex. Consequently, the upper and lower quadrants in extrastriate cortex are physically isolated on opposite sides of striate cortex. We propose that a lesion involving V2/V3 may be sufficient to create a visual field defect. Although the lesion may have irregular margins, if it crosses the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate cortex, it will produce a quadrantic visual field defect with a sharp horizontal border because of the split layout of the upper and lower quadrants in V2/V3. 
Hypoechoic lesions in fatty liver. Quantitative study by histomorphometry. Ten patients with fatty liver changes were subjected to liver biopsies. In seven, ultrasonography showed focal hypoechogenicity within a "bright" liver, generally interpreted as focal sparing. Three patients had hyperechoic areas surrounded by "normal" parenchyma usually felt to represent local fat accumulation without diffuse involvement. Morphometric analysis was used to determine the total area occupied by fat (area density) and the number of lipid droplets (numerical density) per microscopic field in lesional and perilesional specimens. Compared with respective perilesional values, hypoechoic lesional numerical densities were significantly lower in 6 of 7 patients; the three hyperechoic samples had significantly higher values. In most cases, lesional and perilesional area densities were not significantly different. These hypoechoic focal lesions are believed to be merely areas in which a similar quantity of fat is contained in fewer droplets, and focal hyperechogenicity is believed to result from a larger number of fat-filled vacuoles with respect to that of the surrounding parenchyma. Variation in the number of solid-liquid interfaces causes the ultrasonic contrast between these lesions and the similarity fatty liver parenchyma surrounding them. 
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring in the perioperative period: relationship of preoperative status and outcome. We have used continuous ambulatory electrocardiography in the perioperative period to monitor 108 patients with known cardiovascular disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. There was a high incidence of ischaemic ST segment changes and ventricular arrhythmias. For the group as a whole, anaesthesia and surgery were followed by increased ventricular ectopic activity, but did not worsen myocardial ischaemia. However, the mean duration of ischaemic ST segment changes was increased significantly in those patients with treated hypertension. Of the risk factors considered, preoperative ischaemia and peroperative systolic arterial pressure were significant correlates with postoperative myocardial ischaemia. 
Diagnostic value of measurement of serum type I procollagen carboxy terminal peptides in patients with scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. We have evaluated the radioimmunoassay for type I procollagen carboxy terminal peptide (type I C-peptide), which is liberated from type I procollagen during its conversion to collagen, in the serodiagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. The mean (SD) serum concentration of type I C-peptide in 39 normal subjects was 41.7 (19.7) ng/ml. The mean serum values and the positive ratio of type I C-peptide in 11 patients with stages II and III scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach were 91.2 (41.9) ng/ml and 54.5%, respectively. In 10 patients with other types of gastric carcinoma, the mean type I C-peptide values were not significantly different from the normal value. Serum type I C-peptide values reflected the clinical course of scirrhous gastric carcinoma in five patients who underwent either operation or chemotherapy. The measurement of serum type I C-peptide concentrations could provide a useful way of diagnosing and monitoring scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. 
Effects of time required for reperfusion (thrombolysis or angioplasty, or both) and location of acute myocardial infarction on left ventricular functional reserve capacity several months later. The purpose of this study was to determine whether reperfusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or both, would improve left ventricular (LV) function when it is measured several months later at rest or maximal bicycle exercise, or both. Radionuclide angiography was performed in 44 patients 5 months (range 6 weeks to 9 months) after AMI to assess function, and tomographic myocardial thallium-201 imaging was performed at maximal exercise and delayed rest to determine whether there was any evidence of myocardial ischemia. As expected, no patient had chest pain or redistribution of a thallium defect during the exercise test, because patients had undergone angioplasty (n = 28) or coronary bypass graft surgery (n = 5) where clinically indicated for revascularization. The LV ejection fraction was plotted as a function of the time elapsed between the onset of chest pain and the time when coronary angiography confirmed patency of the infarct-related artery (achieved in 91% of 44 patients by rt-PA [n = 31] or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [n = 9] ). Functional responses differed markedly between patients with anterior (n = 20) versus inferior (n = 24) wall AMI. LV ejection fraction during exercise correlated with time to reperfusion in patients with an anterior wall AMI (r = -0.58; standard error of the estimate = 11.9%; p less than 0.02) but not in patients with an inferior AMI (r = 0.10; standard error of the estimate = 13.1%; difference not significant. 
Cryosurgery in 50 cases of tongue carcinoma. From March 1975 to October 1985, 50 patients with primary tongue carcinoma were treated by cryosurgery. Forty-seven had squamous cell carcinoma, and 3 had other types of malignant tumors. The TNM clinical classification showed 12 patients with T1 lesions, 35 with T2, and 3 with T3. All patients were treated by cryosurgery in the outpatient clinic under local anesthesia. Three weeks after the primary tumors were controlled cryosurgically, 48 patients underwent radical neck dissections. All patients were observed for 3 to 10 years. After cryosurgery, the primary lesion disappeared in 45 (90%) patients; 5 were not controlled. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.9% (23/32) and 72.3% (13/18), respectively. The recurrence rate in this series was 10% (5/50). Cryosurgery for tongue carcinoma was shown to be effective and safe. 
Successful combined operation for Takayasu's arteritis. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis complicated with aortic regurgitation and severe stenosis of the left coronary ostium and the innominate artery. Simultaneous surgical treatment of aortic valve replacement, coronary ostium endarterectomy, and aortosubclavian artery bypass using saphenous vein were performed. We discuss the choice of simultaneous operation and the option of surgical treatment for coronary ostium lesion due to Takayasu's arteritis. 
Morphologic features and nuclide composition of infarction-associated cardiac myocyte mineralization in humans. Low dietary Mg results in Ca loading of cardiac myocytes, which increases the likelihood of myocyte calcification in the event of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and possibly increases myocyte vulnerability to necrosis. Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite. 
Nd:YAG laser and photodynamic therapy for esophageal and endobronchial tumors under general and local anesthesia. Effects on arterial blood gas levels. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the respiratory and acid-base metabolism response to endoscopic laser surgery for obstructive tumors, as related to the duration and different types of endoscopy, anesthesia, and laser treatment. DESIGN: The design was a case-control, cohort analytic, nonrandomized controlled survey of case series before and after endoscopic procedures. SETTING: A referral-based surgery and oncology practice at one hospital's laser center. PATIENTS: We studied a sequential sample of 82 patients in the age range from 35 to 92 years, with malignant and benign, primary and metastatic, partially and completely obstructing esophageal (15 patients) and endobronchial (67 patients) tumors. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 229 diagnostic, laser treatment, and follow-up endoscopic procedures was performed under general or local anesthesia (46 esophagoscopies and 183 bronchoscopies). The latter group consisted of 29 cases of general and 154 cases of local topical anesthesia. The last group involved 37 diagnostic and toilet bronchoscopies, 86 cases of YAG-laser tumor ablation, and 31 cases of PDT. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Direct-reading electrode measurements of arterial blood, sampled before and immediately after the endoscopic procedure, revealed statistically significant (p less than 0.001) increases in PaCO2 (200 of 229 cases) and decreases in pH (195 of 229 cases) and PaO2 (215 of 229 cases). These findings were similar after bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy, general and local anesthesia (only the decrease in pH was less pronounced in the latter case), and explorative endoscopies and different laser treatments and did not correlate with the total duration of the procedure within the wide time range of 7 to 210 minutes. The initial preoperative level of PaCO2 was considerably higher and the level of PaO2 was significantly lower in patients with endobronchial tumors, as compared to patients with esophageal cancer. A strong, inverse linear relationship was found between the perioperative changes in PaO2 and its initial level and between PaCO2 and pH changes. CONCLUSIONS: The PDT for esophageal and endobronchial malignancies is no more harmful for acid-base metabolism and respiratory functions than YAG-laser tumor ablation or any other common, nonlaser endoscopic procedure. 
Comparison of restorative proctocolectomy with and without covering ileostomy in ulcerative colitis. The experience of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis is reported in 16 consecutive patients with no covering ileostomy (group 2) in comparison with 15 patients with a covering stoma (group 1); in each group a J pouch was constructed. All patients had pre- and postoperative clinical and manometric evaluations of the functional result up to 12 months. There were no deaths or permanent failures. The number of early complications was four in each group. Re-ileostomy was needed in one patient of group 1, and an ileostomy was constructed in three patients of group 2. At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy. It is concluded that a covering ileostomy may be unnecessary in restorative proctocolectomy, at least in suitable cases with no technical difficulty at the time of operation. 
Does the retrocecal position of the vermiform appendix alter the clinical course of acute appendicitis? A prospective analysis. Ninety-four adult patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis were prospectively studied during a 2-year period. Patients were divided into retrocecal (group 1; n = 27 [29%]) and anterior (group 2; n = 67 [71%]) groups according to the position of the appendix. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in duration of symptoms, presenting signs and symptoms, and initial white blood cell count. Furthermore, retrocecal appendicitis was not associated with a higher rate of perforation or increased morbidity. We conclude that the retrocecal position of the appendix does not alter the presentation of appendicitis. 
Paired comparisons of efficacy of intravenous and oral procainamide in patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thirty-eight patients who had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia during baseline programmed electrical stimulation underwent electrophysiologic testing after both intravenous and oral administration of procainamide. Each had presented clinically with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or out of hospital cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction. In 23 patients (61%) (Group I) the arrhythmia became noninducible during an intravenous infusion of procainamide. Oral procainamide was subsequently administered and retesting was carried out after dose titration to match plasma concentration at the end of the intravenous study. Among the 23 patients in Group I the mean (+/- SD) plasma procainamide level was 7.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml after intravenous dosing and 7.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/ml after oral dosing (p = 0.09). In 15 (65%) of the 23 patients, sustained ventricular arrhythmia was inducible on oral therapy with comparable plasma procainamide levels (intravenous = 6.3 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml, oral = 7.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml). The other eight patients (35%) had concordant responses to repeat testing with comparable intravenous (mean 9.0 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml) and oral (8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml) plasma procainamide levels. In the additional 15 patients (Group II) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible on intravenous procainamide therapy and the patients were retested on oral therapy with similar plasma concentration (p = 0.05). In seven patients (47%) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was noninducible on treatment with oral procainamide (mean plasma level 7.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml) after failure of intravenous procainamide (mean plasma level 10.3 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml). 
Effect of risk status on treatment criteria. Implications of hypertension trials. When deciding whether to treat a patient with hypertension, clinicians must balance the benefit of treatment against its adverse effects. In the absence of an interaction, the multiplicative model of risk implies that the absolute benefit of treatment is related to the underlying risk of an adverse outcome. Thus, each additional risk factor multiplies the absolute benefit of treating hypertension. Analyses of data from subgroups in clinical trials of hypertension treatment suggest that this model is usually valid. In contrast, the adverse effects of treatment are usually unrelated to other risk factors. Thus, the cutoff point for treatment differs in different individuals: setting a single treatment threshold and goal for the entire population is not appropriate. Patients who are at high absolute risk because of prior coronary artery disease or other risk factors have a greater potential absolute benefit, and such patients deserve a low threshold and goal, such as a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg. Conversely, persons at low risk, such as white women without other risk factors, do not require such aggressive management. 
Virological investigations of acute encephalopathy in India A total of 740 consecutive children aged between 6 months and 12 years who presented with acute encephalopathic illnesses during a three year period were assessed both clinically and by laboratory investigations. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined for the presence of cells or other abnormal substances, and any organisms were cultured. Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable. Japanese encephalitis is an important cause of acute childhood encephalopathy in this region. Clinical features of the illness may be mimicked by several disorders which require specific treatment. Thirty four of the 92 died (37%). 
Cladosporium trichoides cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a liver transplant recipient. Report of a case. Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis (also referred to as cerebral chromomycosis), one of the diseases caused by the dematiaceous (black) fungi, is most commonly caused by Cladosporium trichoides (referred to by some as Xylohypha bantiana) and is a rare disease, with 31 culture-proven cases reported to date. Although most cases have occurred in immunocompetent hosts, recent experimental evidence suggests that host immunosuppression may predispose patients to the disease. The authors report a case of fatal cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a liver transplant patient, the first to occur in a transplant patient of any type, to the best of the authors' knowledge. This case provides support for the hypothesis that immunosuppressed patients may be at increased risk for development of this disease. 
Endoprosthetic replacement for stage IIB osteosarcoma. Over an eight-year period, 100 patients with IIB osteosarcoma have been managed. Eighty-one were treated with limb-salvage procedures, 78 of which involved reconstruction utilizing endoprostheses. Only 19 patients received amputation as the primary treatment for local control. Since 1984, all patients received preoperative and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. Those patients who received chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in five-year survival over those who did not (57% and 32%, respectively, p = 0.014). The functional results were good overall, with excellent results seen in distal femoral reconstruction. Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%). Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable. The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%. Local complications were manageable. A statistical analysis revealed that the relative risk of patient death was 2.5 times higher than prosthesis failure for the 78 patients with endoprosthetic reconstruction. The intermediate-term results, with a median follow-up period of 43 months, remains encouraging. 
Quinapril: a new second-generation ACE inhibitor. Quinapril is a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite, quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61 percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril. Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and enalapril. A small number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have been treated with quinapril. Preliminary data indicate that quinapril is an equally effective therapeutic alternative to presently available ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF. 
Astroviruses as a cause of nosocomial outbreaks of infant diarrhea. During a 16-month study period at a children's hospital, 32 children developed nosocomial gastroenteritis caused by astroviruses. Twenty-five of these occurred during 2 epidemic outbreaks in medical and surgical infants' wards. From the community, 13 confirmed cases were admitted during the study period. Both community-acquired and nosocomial cases occurred during autumn, winter and early spring. The attack rates during outbreaks ranged between 7 and 62% and were highest among children with underlying gastrointestinal diseases. Diarrhea and vomiting were the most common clinical manifestations. The median duration of symptoms was 4 days and that of virus excretion was 5 days. Hospital infection with astroviruses is common and usually affects children less than 2 years of age. The probable mode of transmission is spread via contaminated hands. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for secondary prevention of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Asymptomatic men (N = 114) 50 years of age or older had screening for colorectal neoplasia with flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy regardless of the sigmoidoscopic result. Our study objective was to determine the prevalence of patients having isolated adenomatous polyps in a proximal colonic segment in the absence of a distal index neoplasm within reach of the sigmoidoscope. Through the combined use of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, adenomatous polyps were detected in 47 of 114 individuals (41%). A total of 88 adenomas was found. Seventeen patients had isolated neoplasms in proximal colonic segments in the absence of distal adenomas. These patients represented 15% of screened subjects (17 of 114) and 20% of individuals who lacked adenomas on sigmoidoscopy (17 of 84). The majority of proximal neoplasms were small (less than 1.0 cm), tubular adenomas. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for screening asymptomatic men for neoplasia. However, it remains to be determined if a 20% miss rate (for those with a normal sigmoidoscopic examination) is significant and whether small proximal adenomas are worth finding. 
Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. 
Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography for diagnosis in chronic ischemic heart disease. Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography is frequently employed for the diagnosis of chest pain syndromes. Its value and limitations in this regard have been well studied, but proper utilization of the technique requires an understanding of five critical concepts: 1) Radionuclide angiography is superior to treadmill exercise testing and probably equivalent to thallium scintigraphy, although the published series did not use current methods. 2) The true specificity of radionuclide angiography is about 80%, intermediate between the early optimistic estimates and the later pessimistic ones. 3) The peak exercise ejection fraction is the preferred test parameter for diagnosis, although exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and electrocardiographic changes should also be considered. 4) Although radionuclide angiography is clearly helpful for noninvasive diagnosis, significant numbers of patients will continue to fall in an uncertain category. 5) The proper application of the technique requires recognition of its limitations and careful attention to technical details. When properly applied, this modality can make an important contribution to clinical decision making. 
Serum bupivacaine concentrations following wound infiltration in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy. Serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured in 12 children who underwent elective herniotomy and who received analgesia in the form of wound infiltration. Mean (SD) peak concentration was 0.36 (0.14) micrograms/ml and time to peak concentration was 14.6 (7.2) minutes after infiltration of 1.25 mg/kg of bupivacaine. These concentrations are lower than those associated with other local anaesthetic blocks and well below potentially toxic levels. Wound infiltration provides a simple, effective and safe method of providing postoperative analgesia for hernia repair in children. 
Infections with Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2) in neurosurgical patients. During a 20-month period at Temple University Hospital, three cases of infection with bacteria of the Ve group--Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2)--were seen in neurosurgical patients. Two of the patients, including one with what is thought to be the first reported case of meningitis due to C. luteola, had complications caused by prosthetic material. A review of the literature revealed 14 well-described cases of infection with C. luteola or F. oryzihabitans, the majority of which were cases of bacteremia or peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis. The presence of foreign material and the use of corticosteroids may predispose to and influence the course of disease. As prosthetic material becomes even more widely used, the incidence of infection with bacteria of the Ve group will likely increase and the manifestations of the infections will probably become more varied. 
Postirradiation sarcoma. Analysis of a nationwide cancer registry material. Thirty-three cases of postirradiation sarcoma (PIS) from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry were analyzed. The most frequent first primary tumors were cancers of the breast (seven cases) and female reproductive organs (13 cases). Five patients had a childhood cancer. The median total radiation dose at the site of the PIS was 3600 cGy (1600 cGy to 11200 cGy). The median interval from start of radiation therapy to detection of PIS was 13.2 years (3.4 to 22.8 years). The PIS was of soft tissue origin in 25 of 33 cases. The most frequent histologic types were osteosarcoma (ten cases, including four extraskeletal tumors), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (ten cases), and fibrosarcoma (six cases). The overall crude 5-year survival rate was 29% (calculated from the start of treatment for PIS), and for patients initially treated with either radical surgery or combined marginal surgery and postoperative irradiation it was 67%. The authors conclude that there is a chance for cure for radically treated patients with postirradiation sarcoma that emphasizes the importance of regular long-term follow-up of cancer patients. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. I. Biochemical and morphologic investigations. During a 4-year period (1984 to 1988), 50 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were subjected to investigations that aimed to identify and characterize children with mitochondrial disorders. Biochemical and morphologic investigations of quadriceps muscle biopsy tissue were done, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain function, enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of at least two of five criteria: (1) abnormal results of oximetry, (2) abnormal results of spectrophotometry, (3) enzyme histochemical evidence of cytochrome x oxidase deficiency, (4) deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, and (5) abundant ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria. With the combined biochemical and morphologic investigation, 20 of the children were found to have mitochondrial disorders. In an additional 10 children a mitochondrial disorder was neither excluded nor verified. Mitochondrial disorders are thus an important cause of central nervous system and neuromuscular disease in children with hyperlactatemia. 
Granulomatous peritonitis and appendicitis of food starch origin. Two patients with food starch granulomatous reactions, one a necrotising granulomatous peritonitis after the perforation of a gastric ulcer and the other a non-necrotising granulomatous appendicitis, are described. The possibility of food starch induced inflammation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Effect of digitalis glycosides on norepinephrine release in the heart. Dual mechanism of action. The effect of ouabain on exocytotic and nonexocytotic norepinephrine release was investigated in perfused rat and guinea pig hearts. The overflow of endogenous norepinephrine and its neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. DOPEG served as the indicator of free axoplasmic norepinephrine concentrations. The overflow of the norepinephrine cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) was determined by radioimmunoassay and NPY was used as marker for exocytotic release. Electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion resulted in exocytotic norepinephrine release in rat and guinea pig hearts. Ouabain caused an increase in stimulation-induced norepinephrine overflow from rat and guinea pig hearts by 40%. However, overflow of NPY was decreased by 40%, indicating a reduced exocytosis rate. Ouabain increased both norepinephrine and NPY overflow, suggesting enhancement of exocytosis, when neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake1) was blocked by desipramine or when presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors were inhibited by yohimbine. The results demonstrate an interaction of ouabain with both calcium-dependent exocytosis and uptake1 of norepinephrine. Under calcium-free conditions, ouabain or potassium-free perfusate resulted in norepinephrine release from hearts when the axoplasmic norepinephrine concentration was elevated by the reserpinelike agent Ro 4-1284. This release was independent from neural activity, not accompanied by NPY overflow, and suppressed by the uptake1 blocker desipramine. These findings are in keeping with carrier-mediated nonexocytotic norepinephrine release that is caused by reversal of the transport direction of the uptake1 carrier. During myocardial ischemia nonexocytotic norepinephrine release was accelerated and enhanced by inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase before ischemia. This study demonstrates the potential of digitalis glycosides to interact both with transmitter exocytosis and with the neuronal catecholamine transport system by Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibition. Interaction with the catecholamine transport system involves both inhibition of norepinephrine inward transport and induction of norepinephrine outward transport, resulting in nonexocytotic norepinephrine release. 
Effects of dynamic cardiomyoplasty on left ventricular performance and myocardial mechanics in dilated cardiomyopathy. We tested the hypothesis that dynamic cardiomyoplasty produces beneficial changes in the functional mechanics of the dilated, failing left ventricle. Chronic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced in seven mongrel dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (260 beats/min) for 3 to 4 weeks. After completion of the induction period, dynamic cardiomyoplasty was performed with the left latissimus dorsi muscle, paced synchronously with the R waves of the electrocardiogram (Medtronic SP1005). Instruments included an aortic flow probe, a left ventricular Millar pressure catheter, and piezoelectric sonomicrometric crystals on the left ventricle for measurements of wall thickness and minor and major axis dimensions. Data were obtained with the stimulator off and on. Statistical comparisons were made with Student's t test for paired data. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty increased the cardiac output of the failing heart (966 +/- 124 versus 1166 +/- 112 ml/min; p less than 0.01). Systolic shortening of both minor and major axis dimensions increased (3.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01, and 4.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.9 mm, p less than 0.05, respectively). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased by 16% (18 +/- 1 versus 15 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Although skeletal muscle contraction increased the pressure development in the left ventricular chamber, mean systolic wall stress was diminished by concomitant changes in left ventricular dimensions (116,144 +/- 11,530 versus 101,268 +/- 7464 dynes/cm2, p less than 0.05). At end-systole, wall thickness increased (11.8 +/- 1.1 versus 12.7 +/- 1.1 mm, p less than 0.01), minor axis dimension decreased (51.3 +/- 1.4 versus 49.2 +/- 1.8 mm, p less than 0.01), and major axis dimension also decreased (85.6 +/- 3.3 versus 79.0 +/- 2.3 mm, p less than 0.05). Our detailed evaluation of left ventricular chamber mechanics suggests that dynamic cardiomyoplasty may have a role in ameliorating the functional and mechanical derangements associated with progression of dilated cardiomyopathy both by augmenting cardiac performance and by diminishing determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption. (All values are expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean.). 
Transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract: evaluation of prognostic factors by histopathology and flow cytometric analysis. Prognostic factors in transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract were assessed with histopathological examination and flow cytometric analysis in a series of 127 patients operated upon between 1976 and 1988. In particular, we evaluated the usefulness of flow cytometry to identify patients who require adjuvant treatment among those with low grade and low stage disease (51% in this series). A multivariate analysis was done on 92 cases, considering patient age and sex, stage, grade and number of lesions (unifocal versus multifocal), site (renal pelvis versus ureter), presence of vesical tumors, recurrences along the urinary tract or in the bladder, type of operation and nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy (diploid versus tetraploid/aneuploid tumors). Only the stage (p = 0.001), grade (p = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, the DNA pattern (p = 0.031), as well as the number of lesions (p = 0.061) were determinant for prognosis. In regard to the subgroup of 41 patients with grade 2 or less, stage P1 or less tumors, no significant difference in survival was demonstrated between diploid and nondiploid tumor patients. However, 7 of 10 patients from the latter group are still under observation. Therefore, our conclusions may have to be modified in the future. 
Comparison of 40 milliliters of 0.25% intrapleural bupivacaine with epinephrine with 20 milliliters of 0.5% intrapleural bupivacaine with epinephrine after cholecystectomy. To determine the influence of the volume of local anesthetic injected for intrapleural analgesia, 40 patients undergoing cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to two groups of 20 patients each. One group received 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine injected intrapleurally postoperatively. The other group received 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine. The onset time of analgesia was nearly the same in both groups and within 25 min all patients were nearly pain free. Our data demonstrate that 100 mg of bupivacaine with epinephrine elicits effective analgesia after cholecystectomy. There are only minor differences between 20 and 40 mL with regard to pain relief. The authors conclude that the volume of local anesthetic within the range of 20-40 mL in an adult has little influence on the extent or duration of intrapleural analgesia. 
Acute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. 
Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. In 68 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage the effect of heparin treatment beginning on the second, fourth or tenth day was investigated. Early (day 2) low-dose heparin medication significantly lowered the incidence of pulmonary embolism. An increase in the number of patients with rebleeding was not observed. The results indicate that the early use of heparin in these patients is safe and can be recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. 
Maple syrup urine disease. Complete defect of the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex due to a deletion of an 11-bp repeat sequence which encodes a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in a family with the disease. Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. 
Injury of the Achilles tendon: diagnosis with sonography. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of sonography for the assessment of injury to the Achilles tendon. After anatomic investigations in three human cadavers, we performed a clinical study in 24 healthy volunteers and 73 symptomatic patients referred for achillodynia or signs of heel thickening or both in whom a clinical diagnosis of acute total rupture was excluded. High-resolution real-time sonography was performed and the results were compared with final clinical diagnoses (55 patients) and surgical findings (18 patients). Fifty-two of the patients had been involved in various sporting activities (long-distance runners, jumpers, and basketball players), three patients had familial hypercholesterolemia, five patients had systemic inflammatory disease, and 13 patients had no known underlying cause. Anatomic investigation demonstrated accurate assessment of tendon structure and thickness. Sonograms were abnormal in 53 patients (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.83), and the extent of structural disorders of the tendon could be assessed properly. Abnormalities occurred in the form of tendon swelling (45%), abnormal tendon structure (42%), rupture (15%), and peritendinous lesions (47%). No changes were detected in low-grade disease of short duration, which suggests symptoms caused by functional disorders. Sonography is valuable in the diagnosis of various lesions of the Achilles tendon and its surrounding tissue. Furthermore, it can be used to estimate the degree of tendon abnormality and to differentiate between functional and morphologic conditions. 
Quantitative thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography during maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine for assessing coronary artery disease. The diagnostic value of maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with intravenously administered adenosine in conjunction with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of coronary artery disease was investigated in 101 consecutive patients who had concomitant coronary arteriography. Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-quantified polar maps of the thallium-201 distribution. Significant coronary artery disease, defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis, was present in 70 patients. The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary artery disease using quantitative analysis was 87% in the total group, 82% in patients without myocardial infarction and 96% in those with prior myocardial infarction; the specificity was 90%. The sensitivity for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients without infarction with single-, double-and triple-vessel disease was 76%, 86% and 90%, respectively. All individual stenoses were identified in 68% of patients with double-vessel disease and in 65% of those with triple-vessel disease. The extent of the perfusion defects, as quantified by polar maps, was directly related to the extent of coronary artery disease. In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 SPECT during adenosine infusion has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease, localizing the anatomic site of coronary stenosis and identifying the majority of affected vascular regions in patients with multivessel involvement. 
Nursing and public policy. What is the high ground? To be effective in public policy formation, nurses must establish standards of care and advocate changes in financing and healthcare organization for persons who are not well served. The author delineates four areas (out-of-hospital prenatal and postnatal care; care of chronically mentally ill adults and severely emotionally disturbed youths; care for the elderly, especially in nursing homes; and care of the disabled and the chronically and terminally ill) where nurses should be the authority for much of the care provided. The author concludes that evolving dissatisfaction with the healthcare system means that nurses have the opportunity to make major contributions to the organization of all parts of the system, as it is ultimately put together, if they do the research and advocacy that is needed. 
Selection criteria for successful immediate breast reconstruction. To evaluate the factors leading to success in immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, 176 consecutive immediate reconstructions done with implants or expanders over a 5-year period were analyzed. None of these 176 had "complete muscle coverage." There were only five failures: four with implant loss (one involving radiation) and one removed electively. The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders. There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants. Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed. It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of "complete muscle coverage." It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection. Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed. 
Role of anteroventral third ventricle and vasopressin in renal response to stress in borderline hypertensive rats. The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat. In response to acute environmental stress (air jet), the borderline hypertensive rat exhibits a diuretic response, whereas the parental strains exhibit an antidiuretic response (spontaneously hypertensive rat) or no change in urine flow rate (Wistar-Kyoto rat). This study sought to investigate the role of the periventricular tissue surrounding the anteroventral third ventricle and vasopressin release in the diuretic response of the borderline hypertensive rat to acute environmental stress. Sixteen-week-old borderline hypertensive rats who had consumed a 1% NaCl diet for 10-12 weeks were given either electrolytic lesions of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle or sham lesions. When exposed to acute environmental stress 4 weeks later, the increase in volume of dilute urine seen in the sham-lesion rats was not observed in the lesion rats. Plasma vasopressin concentration was decreased by acute environmental stress in the sham-lesion rats (15.2 +/- 4.0 to 10.9 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in the lesion rats (12.3 +/- 2.0 to 13.4 +/- 4.0 pg/ml). In a separate group of intact borderline hypertensive rats, a constant intravenous infusion of vasopressin prevented the diuretic response to acute environmental stress. The results suggest that acute environmental stress produces a diuresis in the borderline hypertensive rats via a decrease in plasma vasopressin concentration that is dependent on the integrity of the periventricular tissue of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle. 
Endocardial fibroelastosis in infants with hydrops fetalis. Endocardial fibroelastosis, defined as an endocardium in excess of 30 microns thick, was found in 10 out of 34 cases of hydrops fetalis in a review of 1589 perinatal necropsies carried out between 1976 and 1989. The infants comprised 16 cases of rhesus haemolytic disease, of whom three had endocardial fibroelastosis, and 18 cases of non-rhesus hydrops, of whom seven had endocardial fibroelastosis. Intrauterine congestive heart failure was thought to have been the probable cause of hydrops in eight of the 10 infants with endocardial fibroelastosis. None of an age matched control group without endocardial fibroelastosis had evidence of congestive cardiac failure. These observations support the hypothesis that endocardial fibroelastosis is an endocardial response to chronic prenatal myocardial stress. 
Inspiratory muscle dysfunction and chronic hypercapnia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease A prospective evaluation of the prevalence of CO2 retention and its relationship to lung mechanics and inspiratory muscle strength was carried out in 311 clinically stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Of these patients 32.8% had hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than or equal to 43 mm Hg). PaCO2 was directly related to lung resistance (RL; r = 0.53) and inversely related to FEV1 (r = 0.53) and to an expression of the dead space/tidal volume ratio (1 - VD/VT) (r = 0.48). RL was found to be a major determinant of the mean intrathoracic pressure swing developed during inspiration (PI) at rest (r = 0.85). Maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) was found to improve the predictive value for PaCO2 of several mechanical loads, with RL/PImax the best predictor (r = 0.57). The prevalence of hypercapnia increased from virtually 0 to 100% with increases in the RL/PImax value and was higher in the obese subjects at intermediate RL/PImax values, probably because of the burden placed on the respiratory muscles by chest wall mass loading. Our results show that chronic alveolar hypoventilation is likely to develop in COPD patients who have a combination of high inspiratory loads and inspiratory muscle weakness. hypercapnia may be one strategy available to avoid overloading of the inspiratory muscles leading to fatigue and possible irreversible failure. 
Evaluation of light microscopy to localise the site of haematuria. Red cell morphology was examined by light microscopy in 122 urine specimens from 99 patients with haematuria in an attempt to define the site of origin. Altogether 84% of glomerular bleeding and 91% of non-glomerular bleeding was correctly assigned according to diagnoses determined by renal biopsy in 51 patients and clinically in 48. The test should be interpreted with caution as both false positive and false negative results were observed, some in the same individual with unchanged pathology at different times. No advantage of phase contrast over bright field microscopy was apparent even when examining uncentrifuged urines. 
Relative predispositional effects (RPEs) of marker alleles with disease: HLA-DR alleles and Graves disease. A method is described to reveal the relative predispositional effects (RPEs) (predisposing, protective, or neutral) of the HLA alleles or of any other marker system that is associated with a disease. When the disease is associated with two or more alleles of a locus, the RPE method identifies the associations sequentially according to their strength; thus the problem that a strong association with one allele can create misleading deviations in the frequencies of other alleles is alleviated. Using this method, we have examined the relative effects of HLA-DR alleles in susceptibility to Graves disease in the Caucasian population. The well-established positive association with DR3 was confirmed as the strongest effect. In addition, a negative association was found between DR5 and Graves disease. The reduced frequency of DR5 among patients is statistically significant and is not a result of the increase in DR3. Finally, when patients were divided according to the presence or absence of eye disease, the latter showed a significant increase in the frequency of DR4. With family data, linkage to HLA of Graves disease was established in both Caucasian and Chinese families by the sib-pair method. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric carcinoma among Japanese Americans in Hawaii BACKGROUND. Helicobacter pylori are gram-negative spiral bacteria that are associated with chronic gastritis, a known precursor of gastric carcinoma. Persons at high risk for gastric carcinoma have been shown to have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS. We studied the relation of H. pylori infection and gastric carcinoma in a cohort of Japanese American men living in Hawaii. The 5908 men were enrolled and examined from 1967 to 1970. By 1989, 109 cases of pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma had been identified. The store serum of each patient with gastric carcinoma and of each matched control subject were tested for the presence of serum IgG antibody to H. pylori. RESULTS. Ninety-four percent of the men with gastric carcinoma and 76 percent of the matched control subjects had a positive test for H. pylori antibodies, for an odds ratio of 6.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 17.3). As the level of antibody to H. pylori increased, there was a progressive increase in the risk of gastric carcinoma (P for trend = 0.0009). The association was strong even for men in whom the diagnosis was made 10 or more years after the serum sample was obtained (odds ratio, 10.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 44.8). CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is strongly associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma. However, most persons infected with H. pylori will never have gastric carcinoma. Therefore, other factors that increase the risk of gastric carcinoma among persons infected with H. pylori need to be identified. 
Intracranial vascular abnormalities: value of MR phase imaging to distinguish thrombus from flowing blood. The interpretation of conventional spin-echo and gradient-echo MR images of intracranial vascular lesions can be complex and ambiguous owing to variable effects on image intensity caused by flowing blood or thrombus. MR phase images, obtained simultaneously with conventional-magnitude images, are useful for evaluating proton motion (i.e., blood flow), and therefore can simplify the diagnosis of the presence or absence of thrombosis within a vascular structure or lesion. Fourteen patients with a variety of intracranial vascular abnormalities (aneurysms, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, neoplasms adjacent to venous sinuses, and vascular malformations) were evaluated with conventional MR and phase imaging for the presence of blood flow. The phase images correlated with angiography in all cases. Phase imaging was not necessarily better than conventional spin-echo imaging in all cases, but it simplified the evaluation of thrombus vs blood flow in many. In three of five aneurysms, the phase images were diagnostic for evaluating lumen patency whereas the conventional images were ambiguous. Phase imaging was advantageous for detecting tumor invasion of the venous sinus when venous blood was enhanced by gadopentetate dimeglumine. A laminar flow phantom experiment determined the lower limits of sensitivity of phase imaging to be 0.5 cm/sec in the slice-select and 2.5 cm/sec in the read gradient directions. Phase imaging is a simple, reliable technique that can distinguish thrombosis from flowing blood within intracranial lesions. It is easily performed and adds no additional time to the MR examination. 
A behavioral taxonomy of obese female participants in a weight-loss program. To create a behavioral classification of obesity, 2-wk baseline food diaries were obtained from 236 obese women entering weight-loss programs. Subjects monitored food intake along with the social, environmental, and emotional context in which each meal occurred. Variables representing situation-specific eating behaviors were statistically extracted from greater than 11,000 eating episodes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified five distinct groups of subjects on the basis of similarity of eating patterns. The five groups were (1) moderately healthy eating habits, (2) chronic food restrictors, (3) alternating diet-binge eaters, (4) emotional overeaters, (5) unrestricted meal overeaters. The five groups differed on questionnaire measures of emotional adjustment and eating behavior but did not differ on dropout rates, amount of weight lost, or exercise compliance. The chronic food restrictors had significantly less lean body mass, lower resting metabolic rates, and higher waist-to-hip ratios than did the unrestricted meal overeaters. 
Economic impact of diagnosis-related groups and severity of illness on reimbursement for central nervous system infections. Because the federal government's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification system for prospective payment has not been widely applied to hospitalized pediatric patients, we analyzed the effectiveness of one DRG category (central nervous system infections) for a single year at a medium-sized children's hospital to control for patients' severity of illness and for hospital reimbursement. Several independent measures of severity of illness (length of stay, duration of fever, Physiologic Severity Index) showed that patients with bacterial meningitis and those with encephalitis (DRG 20) were more ill than those with aseptic meningitis (DRG 21) (p less than 0.001 for each measure). Cost analysis revealed that the hospital was only partially reimbursed for its charges (shortfall of $95,547) and that patients with Medicaid or no insurance accounted for 22% of discharges but 88% of losses. Reimbursement by DRG would have increased payment for DRG 21 but decreased that for DRG 20. If DRGs were applied to pediatric central nervous system infections and used in a prospective payment system, they would accurately predict disease severity between but not within groups, and significant financial losses for children's hospitals would still occur. 
Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery: a case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery is a known but unusual complication of renal transplantation usually occurring in the first month. Reported here is a case of acute renal artery thrombosis in a well functioning long-term renal allograft in which there was clear angiographic evidence of a normal renal artery two years earlier. 
Lateral rhachotomy for thoracic spinal lesions. Capener's "Lateral Rhachotomy" was modified by additional excision of the pedicle, articular facets, part of the lamina, and a posterior half of the vertebral bodies on one side through a transpleural approach to the thoracic spine, and a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine. The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely. This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass. The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura. In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion. Using "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy," it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision. In the present report, the authors described their "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy" procedure, and reviewed the case material. 
Peripheral mucoepidermoid tumour of the lung. Mucoepidermoid tumours of the bronchial tree are uncommon neoplasms, which are believed to arise from terminal ducts of the proximal tracheobronchial tree. The first case of a peripheral mucoepidermoid tumour of the lung is reported. 
Mitral valve repair in the extensively calcified mitral valve annulus. Mitral valve replacement in patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus is associated with an increased risk of ventricular rupture. Until now techniques of mitral valve repair have not been applied to patients with a heavily calcified mitral valve annulus. We present 12 patients who underwent extensive decalcification of the annulus with subsequent mitral valve repair between 1987 and 1990. Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV. All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency. There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events. Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients. All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement. 
Efficacy of danazol in the control of hormonal migraine. Of 131 women with hormonally related migraines unresponsive to standard medication, 67 (51.1%) noted profound relief after a 12-month, phased study using danazol for migraine prevention. The first three phases consisted of two-month cycles: dietary control and acetazolamide, the addition of danazol and danazol discontinuation. Eighty-three women (63.36%) reported control of their hormonal migraines while using danazol. In phase IV, 81 women whose headaches were controlled by danazol restarted danazol for an additional six months. Sixty-seven (82.7%) reported continued success with this medication. Danazol proved highly successful in the control of women's cyclic migraine. Its effectiveness remained consistent throughout the treatment course. In the prophylactic treatment of women's hormonal migraine, 400 mg of danazol administered daily for 25 days each month can prove effective when standard medical therapy fails. Furthermore, the response to danazol supported the concept that hormonal migraine should be treated as a distinct clinical entity. 
Orientation and moment arms of some trunk muscles. The orientations and moment arms of nine trunk muscles: latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi, obliquii, rectus and transversalis abdominis, quadratus lumborum, and iliopsoas were obtained on embalmed specimens. Each muscle was considered as one or several, linear or curvilinear, lines of action. Origins, insertions, and points along the length of main bundles were digitized for each muscle using a three-dimensional digitizer. The results obtained from seven male specimens are presented and will permit more refined biomechanical models. 
Prophylaxis of nasolacrimal duct obstruction after major sinus surgery using a silicone stent. Damage to the nasolacrimal duct during major sinus procedures results in troublesome symptoms of epiphora and acute infection. Prophylactic stenting of the lacrimal apparatus using a silicone stent is described as a means of preventing such complications. 
Renal disease, epidermal necrosis, and epithelial cell antibodies. OBJECTIVE--To describe the association between epithelial cell IgM, which has previously been associated with an increased incidence of loss of renal graft in children, with a novel cutaneous eruption and unexplained native renal disease. DESIGN--Observational study on children with epithelial cell antibody presenting with unexplained renal or skin disease. SETTING--General paediatric department and regional paediatric nephrology unit. PATIENTS--Six children (five girls, one boy), who presented to the unit in 1989-90. RESULTS--Three children, two of whom had a history of a hyperpigmented rash, presented with hypertension, proteinuria, and impaired renal function. Renal biopsy specimens from two of these children showed severe arteriolar endothelial cell swelling with arteriolar occlusion. These children fully recovered after treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The third child developed end stage renal failure and required dialysis. Three other children presented with an unusual cutaneous eruption but no evidence of renal disease. Histology of the skin lesions showed acute epidermal necrosis and features consistent with a viral infection. CONCLUSIONS--The aetiology and pathogenesis of the epithelial cell antibody are unknown. These cases indicate that it may have a role in native kidney disease and focal epidermal necrosis. Clinical and histological features suggest that the antibody may be associated with a viral infection. 
Placement of an ileal loop urinary diversion back in continuity with the intestinal tract. The use of ileum from a previously constructed urinary conduit for lengthening the small bowel has not been previously reported. We describe a patient with the short-bowel syndrome from previous small-bowel resections, radiation enteritis, and an ileal urinary diversion. The ileal conduit was revised because of recurrent hyperammonemic encephalopathy and apparent stricture of the ureteroenteric anastomosis. In an attempt to increase intestinal length, the ileal conduit was replaced by a colon conduit and the ileum was placed back in continuity with the intestinal tract. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and her chronic diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic derangements resolved. The ileal loop segment regained a normal intestinal appearance on radiographic studies. We suggest that when revision of an ileal urinary diversion is required restoration of the ileum into the intestinal tract may be of particular benefit to patients with the short-bowel syndrome. 
Screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms in patients undergoing coronary angiography. In screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms, an intracranial intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), posteroanterior view, was obtained in 72 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography for workup of angina pectoris. In cases where an aneurysm was suspected from IA-DSA, conventional intracranial angiography was obtained. Five asymptomatic unruptured aneurysms were detected in four of these cases. The aneurysms ranged from 4 to 16 mm in diameter. There were no complications associated with the coronary angiography nor with the additional intracranial IA-DSA, which required less than 5 minutes to perform in all cases. The value of performing intracranial IA-DSA in patients undergoing coronary angiography to screen for unruptured asymptomatic aneurysm is discussed, as is the possible racial differences in the frequency of aneurysms. 
Effect of omeprazole on duodenal ulcer-associated antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori. This study set out to investigate the effects of omeprazole or ranitidine on the progression of antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori in patients with active duodenal ulcer. A double-blind, double-dummy trial was performed in 270 patients, 241 of whom were studied histologically for the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 10 mg every morning, omeprazole, 20 mg every morning, or ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for four weeks. Endoscopy was performed on entry and at weekly intervals during the study; at least two antral biopsies were taken on each occasion to assess the activity and degree of chronic inflammation, as reflected by the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and mononuclear cell infiltration, respectively. Biopsy specimens also were assessed histologically for H. pylori. The sex, age and maximal acid output were comparable in the three treatment groups. The percentages of patients showing an improvement in the activity of gastritis in the four consecutive weeks of treatment were 9%, 40%, 51%, and 53% for omeprazole, 10 mg (N = 78); 14%, 42%, 49%, and 53% for omeprazole, 20 mg (N = 81); and 2%, 23%, 30%, and 33% for ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day (N = 82) (life table analysis gave P less than 0.01 for both omeprazole regimens compared with ranitidine). The degree of chronic inflammation showed similar changes. The density of H. pylori decreased significantly after treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg or 20 mg, (both, P less than 0.00001) but not with ranitidine. 
Amplified expression of three jun family members inhibits erythroleukemia differentiation. Several different proto-oncogenes have been shown to influence cellular differentiation. One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression. 
Histological study of white blood cells and their association with lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration. The number of white blood cells per mm2 has been determined in serial histological slides taken from punch biopsies of skin from the goiter region in patients with varicose veins. In eight patients the varicose veins were complicated by lipodermatosclerosis of the skin, and in a further six there was a history of ulceration. In uncomplicated varicose veins there was a median of 6 white blood cells per mm2, in patients with lipodermatosclerosis there were 45 white blood cells per mm2, and where there was a history of ulceration, 217 white blood cells per mm2. No change in white blood cell content was observed after the venous pressure was raised for 30 min by sitting the patient with the lower limb dependent. White blood cell infiltration of the skin is associated with lipodermatosclerotic changes caused by venous insufficiency. 
Fatal varicella in an adult: case report and review of the gastrointestinal complications of chickenpox. An unusual and fatal case of primary varicella in an adult is presented. Involvement of the small intestine first manifested as abdominal pain and later progressed to gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent dissemination of the infection. Although it has previously been speculated that gastrointestinal bleeding can result from infection with the varicella-zoster virus, the data from this case include histologic and cultural evidence that supports the clinical observations. The literature has been reviewed, and the management of this patient has been critically evaluated. 
Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. 
Detection of human T-cell leukemia virus type I proviral sequences from fixed tissues of seropositive patients. Fixed lymphoma tissues from 11 patients seropositive for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies were analyzed for proviral sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. Typical adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (ATLLs) from nine patients were positive for HTLV-I sequences. In contrast, one of two lymphomas with immunophenotypes atypical for ATLL was negative for HTLV-I. This HTLV-I DNA-negative lymphoma, although present in an HTLV-I-seropositive patient, was therefore reclassified. The HTLV-I tax gene was always detected in the ATLL tissues, whereas segments of the pol gene were not detected in half the cases. These studies demonstrate that fixed non-ATLL specimens can be distinguished from ATLL specimens. 
"Ex vivo" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The "ex vivo" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). 
Bacterial invasion of the biliary system by way of the portal-venous system. It has been suggested that bacteria in the intestine gain access into the biliary tract by entering the portal-venous blood. We have tested the hypothesis of hematogenous infection of the biliary system in cats. The animals were treated in three different groups: group A (no biliary obstruction), group B (acute biliary obstruction) and group C (chronic biliary obstruction). A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was infused into the splenic vein of cats at three different dosages (10(7), 10(5) and 10(3) with sham controls. In the unobstructed biliary system, the mutant E. coli was isolated from the bile 30 min and 90 min after the infusion of 10(7) and 10(5) E. coli, respectively. No bacteria were found in the bile with the infusion of 10(3) E. coli and in the control animals. Bile flow was significantly reduced with the infusion of bacteria. The biliary excretion of E. coli in group B was similar to that in group A. In group C, the bile output in the first hour was very high but declined rapidly. E. coli was excreted into the bile at all three dosages of infusion after 30 min. Histological sections of the liver showed that the infused bacteria entered the sinusoidal blood and that some were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. The portal-venous blood was considered an important route of bacterial invasion into the biliary system, and the penetration of bacteria was facilitated in biliary obstruction. 
Pediatric musculoskeletal MR imaging. In a review of the indications and uses for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pediatric musculoskeletal system, MR evaluation of conditions unique to the pediatric musculoskeletal system were emphasized. Indications for MR imaging of the pediatric musculoskeletal system include evaluation of bone marrow, neoplastic processes, and periarticular disorders. 
Limitations of balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency. 
Immunohistochemical expression of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in gastric carcinoma. Immunohistochemical localization for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was studied in the gastric tissues from 115 patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. We compared two groups: 57 patients who died of recurrence or metastases within 2 yr (group I) and 58 patients who survived 5 yr or more after resection (group II). The staining patterns were classified into negative, apical, and/or cytoplasmic type and stromal type. Thirty-three cases (58%) of group I showed a stromal type, whereas only 17 cases (30%) of group II showed the same type. In undifferentiated type carcinoma, the stromal type was seen in 20 cases (65%) of group I and seven cases (23%) of group II. However, in differentiated type carcinoma, there was only a small difference in the appearance of stromal type between group I (50%) and group II (37%). The immunohistochemical localization for CA19-9 in the tumor tissues, particularly in undifferentiated carcinoma, will be useful in predicting the prognosis of the patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. 
Stomal recurrence after laryngectomy: interrelated risk factor study. This study was designed to identify pathogenic factors in recurrent carcinoma at the tracheal stoma. The charts of 444 patients with laryngeal cancer who were treated surgically between 1976 and 1988 revealed stomal recurrence in 15 (3.4%). Eighty percent of the patients with stomal recurrence had tumors in the subglottis. In comparison to patients with different sites involved this was significant (p less than 0.001). Other variables examined and analyzed included primary stage, previous treatment, neck pathologic status, neck treatment, age, sex, postoperative adjunctive therapy, and timing of tracheotomy. Tumor involvement of the subglottis is the single most important variable in stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Previous conservation laryngeal surgery and preoperative/emergency tracheotomy are not related to stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Mean length of survival for patients with stomal recurrence of carcinoma in our series was 8.9 months. Two patients were successfully treated with extensive surgical resection. The dismal prognosis of stomal recurrence of carcinoma suggests that management of this condition should focus on prevention. Treatment of patients with tumors of the subglottis should include attention to the paratracheal region and superior mediastinum, in conjunction with laryngectomy immediately after initial diagnosis. 
Lung function abnormalities at 6 months of age after neonatal intensive care. Respiratory function was studied in 46 preterm infants (median gestational age 28 weeks) at 6 months of age. Respiratory function was assessed by measurement of thoracic gas volume, airways resistance (from which specific conductance was calculated), and functional residual capacity. To determine the effect of the duration of neonatal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) on respiratory function, the infants' results were divided into three groups: group A, no IPPV; group B, IPPV for less than seven days; and group C, IPPV for more than seven days. Measurements of thoracic gas volume and functional residual capacity were similar to published reference ranges and there were no significant differences between the three groups. Measurements of airways resistance and specific conductance were higher than published reference ranges (mean airways resistance of group A, 34 cm H2O/l/sec; B, 34.1 cm H2O/l/sec, and C, 30.4 cm H2O/l/sec) but there was no significant difference between the three groups. The 95% confidence intervals of the difference of the means between groups A and B were -6.94 to 6.73 cm H2O/l/sec and between groups A and C -3.8 to 11.0 cm H2O/l/sec. Our results suggest that factors other than neonatal ventilation may be more important in the pathogenesis of chronic lung function abnormalities in preterm infants. 
Transesophageal echocardiography: a simple method for monitoring the patency of ventriculoatrial shunts. Technical note. A new method for evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt is described, and early experience with it is reported. Transesophageal echocardiography can demonstrate a cerebrospinal fluid leak in the right atrium through the atrial tip of a shunting device. This capability was an incidental discovery, and since then the accuracy of the technique in evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt has been prospectively studied in 20 observations of 16 patients. The method proved to be accurate in 90% to 100% of cases. It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography offers a rapid and accurate assessment of ventriculoatrial shunt function, is well tolerated, and is easy to perform. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: Lutrepulse for injection. A multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the ability of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone to restore physiologic ovulatory function in women with diminished or absent pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. In 109 women with primary and secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Lutrepulse [gonadorelin acetate] for Injection) was extremely effective, resulting in ovulation in 91% and 96% of patients, respectively. Overall complications of intravenous line placement ranged from 0% to 11% (mean = 7%). A 12% incidence of multiple pregnancy was noted, and a single case of ovarian hyperstimulation was reported in a woman who also received clomiphene citrate. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment appears to be of at least comparable efficacy to human menopausal gonadotropins, with the added benefit of reduced overall risks for the patient with hypothalamic amenorrhea. 
Liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats. DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups). ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients. 
Which asymptomatic patients should undergo routine screening carotid duplex scan? The benefits of obtaining a routine screening carotid duplex scan have not been established for patients with peripheral vascular disease but no signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease. We retrospectively reviewed all carotid duplex scans (4,000) performed at our institution between 1985 through 1989 and found for analysis 91 scans in 78 patients who underwent a screening duplex scan because of the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with carotid bruits, abnormal carotid pulses, and focal or nonspecific neurologic symptoms were excluded. Thirty-three percent of these patients had carotid stenosis of 16% to 50%, 14% had carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, and 5% had stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. Individual risk factors for atherosclerosis, including elderly age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a recent or past history of cardiac or vascular surgery, did not predict the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis. However, all 11 of the patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50% were 68 years of age and older, and this age range, in combination with the various risk factors, increased the incidence of significant carotid artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%) to as high as 45%. We conclude that routine screening carotid duplex scan is indicated in elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 68 years) with peripheral vascular disease, even in the absence of any signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease, when other atherosclerotic risk factors are present. 
The Carney complex with ocular signs suggestive of cardiac myxoma. We treated a patient who had ophthalmic findings of the Carney complex that led to a search for and the discovery of asymptomatic cardiac myxoma. Substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with the complex because of the occurrence of cardiac myxoma. Facial and eyelid lentigines, conjunctival and caruncle pigmentation and eyelid pigmentation may precede signs or symptoms of cardiac myxoma. A study of the patient's primary relatives disclosed manifestations of the complex transmitted in a manner consistent with mendelian autosomal dominant inheritance. 
Epidemiology of chronic venous ulcers. A metropolitan population of 238,000 in Perth, Western Australia, was screened for chronic ulceration of the leg. Patients with a chronic leg ulcer and a venous abnormality comprised 57 per cent of all patients with a chronic leg ulcer, giving a prevalence of 0.62 per 1000 population. There was an increasing prevalence with age; 90 per cent of patients were 60 years and older. This group comprised 16.7 per cent of the population, and had a prevalence of 3.3 per 1000. Although chronic venous ulcers were more common in women there was no difference in age related prevalence. In 36 per cent of patients with a venous abnormality, there was at least one other aetiological factor contributing to chronic ulceration of the leg; 96 per cent had either a history of deep venous thrombosis or a condition known to predispose to deep venous thrombosis. 
Loss of heterozygosity for alleles on chromosome II in cervical carcinoma. The HeLa cell (a cervical carcinoma cell line) tumor-suppressor gene has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular genetic studies of nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids derived from normal chromosome 11 x HeLa cell fusions. In the present study, 33 primary cervical carcinoma samples were analyzed using chromosome 11-specific polymorphic DNA markers. The RFLP analysis indicated a somatic loss of chromosome 11 heterozygosity in 10 (30%) of the primary tumors. Preferential loss of the long arm of the chromosome was observed in two of the primary tumors. In addition, at least eight-fold amplification of sequences in the q13 region, including those coding for the fibroblast growth factor-related gene (int-2), was observed in one of the primary tumors. These results suggest a possible role for gene(s) localized to chromosome 11, possibly that localized to the long arm in the development and/or progression of cervical carcinomas. 
Flow cytometric deoxyribonucleic acid analysis in stage I renal cell carcinoma. Tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content was analyzed by flow cytometry in 60 consecutive patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma. Of 59 evaluable tumors 27 (46%) were homogeneously diploid, 1 (2%) was tetraploid and 31 (52%) were aneuploid. Of the 32 nondiploid tumors 25 were heterogeneous concerning ploidy. One of the 27 patients with diploid tumors had metastases compared to 5 of the 32 patients with nondiploid tumors (not significant). There was a significant difference in survival between patients with diploid and nondiploid tumors (p = 0.043). Neither nuclear grade, tumor cell type nor tumor size correlated with survival. Analysis of DNA content seems to predict survival significantly for patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma. 
Composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysm of the ascending aorta: results in 100 patients. One hundred consecutive patients with the Marfan syndrome underwent composite graft repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm between September 1976 and June 1989. Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality. Marfan aneurysms with a diameter of 6 cm or greater should be repaired with the Bentall composite graft procedure, even if the patient is asymptomatic. 
Vascularised fibular graft for congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Long-term results. Five children with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia treated by free vascularised fibular grafts were followed up until skeletal maturity. The ipsilateral fibula was used in four cases, the contralateral fibula in one. All our cases achieved bone union, but leg length discrepancy, atrophy of the foot and ankle stiffness were frequent complications, due perhaps to the many previous operations. Vascularised fibular grafting might achieve better results if it were done as the primary procedure. 
Optical urethrotomy under local urethral anaesthesia. A series of 46 patients underwent 76 optical urethrotomies under local urethral anaesthesia in the out-patient clinic; in 70% of patients the strictures were controlled by local anaesthetic urethrotomy alone; 61% felt either no pain or mild pain during the procedure; 72% expressed a preference for local anaesthesia should the procedure have to be repeated and 82% were happy with the result of their treatment. Optical urethrotomy under local urethral anaesthesia produces results comparable to those reported by others using general anaesthesia. If large numbers of patients are to be treated, possibly repeatedly, then out-patient urethrotomy may result in more efficient use of resources. 
Current treatment of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests result from the sudden onset of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the absence of a new myocardial infarction. Individuals who survive cardiac arrest are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death. To prevent recurrent cardiac arrest, effective treatment must be provided during hospitalization after the initial episode. Caring for the survivor of cardiac arrest requires a detailed clinical investigation to define the underlying cardiac anatomy and left ventricular function and to elucidate the mechanism and characteristics of the patient's arrhythmia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy, such as drugs or a nonpharmacological intervention (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), is then selected based on these considerations. In addition, ischemia is treated aggressively with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, when appropriate, with surgical coronary artery revascularization. 
Differential expression of epidermal growth factor-related proteins in human colorectal tumors. Amphiregulin (AR) and cripto are proteins that are structurally related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). AR is also functionally related to this family of growth regulatory molecules and is able to bind and activate the 170-kDa EGF receptor (EGFR). Human EGFR-3 (HER3)/ERBB3 is a recently identified protein related to the EGFR that is widely expressed in breast carcinomas and is a candidate receptor for EGF-like growth factors. Differential expression of these putative ligands and receptors in transformed cells suggests that they may function in an autocrine manner to regulate tumor cell growth. Specific mRNA transcripts for TGF-alpha [4.8 kilobases (kb)], AR (1.4 kb), cripto (2.2 kb), and HER3 (6.2 kb) were expressed in a majority of human colon cancer cell lines. HER3 mRNA was detected in 55% of primary or metastatic human colorectal carcinomas but in only 22% of normal colon mucosa and 32% of normal liver samples. In contrast, cripto and AR mRNA were expressed in 60-70% of primary or metastatic human colorectal cancers but in only 2-7% of normal human colonic mucosa. Immunostaining also detected AR protein in primary and metastatic colorectal tumors but not in normal colon or uninvolved liver. These findings suggest that cripto and AR may be useful markers to discriminate between normal and malignant colonic epithelium and may provide a selective growth advantage for colorectal carcinomas. 
Helicobacter pylori infection in healthy people: a dynamic process? Epidemiological studies using serological tests have shown that a large proportion of healthy people have antibodies against Helicobacter pylori (anti-Hp). It is uncertain whether the presence of anti-Hp indicates active infection or only past exposure to the micro-organism. In this study we determined anti-Hp with a specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 100 healthy volunteers who were at the same time investigated for active H pylori infection by means of the 13C-urea breath test. Forty nine per cent had a high anti-Hp titre, but only 24% had active H pylori infection. Our study suggests that a considerable number of healthy people previously infected with H pylori have spontaneously eliminated this microorganism. We suggest that the inability of ulcer patients to eliminate H pylori may be important in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. 
The state of the p53 and retinoblastoma genes in human cervical carcinoma cell lines. Human cervical carcinoma cell lines that were either positive or negative for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences were analyzed for evidence of mutation of the p53 and retinoblastoma genes. Each of five HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines expressed normal pRB and low levels of wild-type p53 proteins, which are presumed to be altered in function as a consequence of association with HPV E7 and E6 oncoproteins, respectively. In contrast, mutations were identified in the p53 and RB genes expressed in the C-33A and HT-3 cervical cancer cell lines, which lack HPV DNA sequences. Mutations in the p53 genes mapped to codon 273 and codon 245 in the C33-A and HT-3 cell lines, respectively, located in the highly conserved regions of p53, where mutations appear in a variety of human cancers. Mutations in RB occurred at splice junctions, resulting in in-frame deletions, affecting exons 13 and 20 in the HT-3 and C-33A cell lines, respectively. These mutations resulted in aberrant proteins that were not phosphorylated and were unable to complex with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. These results support the hypothesis that the inactivation of the normal functions of the tumor-suppressor proteins pRB and p53 are important steps in human cervical carcinogenesis, either by mutation or from complex formation with the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. 
Renal cell carcinoma in children. Six cases of renal cell carcinoma in children between seven and nineteen years of age are reported. These patients differ from those with Wilms tumor chiefly in the age of presentation and response to chemotherapy. Radiographically, renal cell carcinoma cannot be distinguished from Wilms tumor. While the natural history of renal cell carcinoma appears to be similar in children and adults, it may have a more favorable prognosis below the age of ten years. 
Delayed excitatory reaction following interaction of cocaine and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine). A case report is presented in which a patient receiving the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, developed a delayed excitatory reaction following administration of topical cocaine spray during anaesthesia for vocal cord surgery. The pharmacological basis of the drug interaction is discussed. 
Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct, depressive, anxiety, and other disorders. OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology. Little is known about the comorbidity of this disorder with disorders other than conduct. Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders. DATA COLLECTION: The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder. FINDINGS: The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders. These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses. Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies. Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Alterations in myocyte shape and basement membrane attachment with tachycardia-induced heart failure. Chronic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) results in left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for LV failure in this setting are not known. LV force production is dependent on the coupling of myocytes to the extracellular matrix, which is mediated through the basement membrane. This study was designed to determine whether alterations in myocyte geometry and basement membrane attachment are associated with LV failure in a pacing-induced model of cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographic measurement of LV function was performed in six pigs after 3 weeks of pacing-induced SVT (240 beats/min) and in eight sham-operated controls. Myocytes from these hearts were isolated, and attachment studies to specific components of the basement membrane were performed using laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV. The SVT group when compared with the control group showed a significant reduction of LV fractional shortening (14 +/- 2% versus 31 +/- 2%, respectively; p less than 0.05), increased end-diastolic dimension (50 +/- 1 versus 35 +/- 1 mm, respectively; p less than 0.05), and lengthening of isolated myocytes (196 +/- 18 versus 142 +/- 9 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). Myocyte attachment to laminin (50 micrograms/ml) was significantly decreased at 60 minutes in the SVT group compared with the control group (18.2 +/- 4.5 versus 60.9 +/- 4.5 cells/mm2, respectively; p less than 0.05). Similar reductions in myocyte attachment to fibronectin and collagen IV were observed. Ultrastructural examination of LV sections revealed focal disruptions of the basement membrane-sarcolemmal interface and a reduced number of sarcolemmal festoons in SVT hearts compared with control hearts (0.8 +/- 0.6 versus 2.8 +/- 0.8/4 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). These alterations in myocyte morphology and basement membrane attachment may contribute to the LV failure associated with chronic SVT. Further, these structural changes may play a significant role in the progression of ventricular dysfunction as well as recovery from chronic SVT. 
Selective cytotoxicity of low-density lipoprotein to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after photoperoxidation with 8-methoxypsoralen. Lymphocyte-containing plasma subjected to photolysis in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (methoxsalen, 8-MOP) has previously been shown to be effective against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and the AIDS-related complex. The mechanism of this effect was thought to involve photoreaction of 8-MOP with DNA, based on certain in vitro experiments. The results of this study suggest a different mechanism. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from fresh human plasma was photosensitized by addition of 8-MOP and exposure to UV light (mp-LDL), and the reactions of the LDL lipids and the chemical actions induced by these reactions were monitored. In a separate procedure, LDL was peroxidized with hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase (p-LDL). mp-LDL and p-LDL were then tested in cytotoxicity assays on HuT-78 helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These results indicate that (a) LDL in plasma in the presence of very low concentrations of 8-MOP (200 ng/mL) can be peroxidized by UV light; (b) this photoperoxidized LDL is cytotoxic to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in a dose-dependent manner; but (c) it does not kill normal lymphocytes under similar conditions. The findings also suggest alternative therapeutic strategies for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as direct utilization of peroxidized LDL. 
Monosialoganglioside in subarachnoid hemorrhage [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Jul;22(7):957] We studied 119 patients with disturbance of consciousness following subarachnoid hemorrhage, due mostly to verified aneurysm rupture, admitted to five Italian neurosurgical departments over 18 months. Level of consciousness as assessed by score on the Glasgow coma Scale ranged from 8 to 14 before the beginning of treatment; level of consciousness was assessed again 7, 14, and 21 days later. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with monosialoganglioside or placebo according to a double-blind experimental design. The two treatment groups were homogeneous at entry with regard to the main clinical parameters. Both groups improved, but the rate and degree of improvement were greater in the monosialoganglioside-treated group. The difference was significant on days 14 (p = 0.04) and 21 (p = 0.02). Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that monosialoganglioside reduces brain edema and provides nonspecific neuronal membrane protection. 
Antenatal therapy to minimize neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage is an important problem, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Attempts to reduce this complication require an understanding of its pathogenesis. In this chapter a model was proposed, consisting of a series of events resulting in rapid changes of cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure and leading to rupture of the unique fragile vessels of the germinal matrix and intraventricular regions. Understanding the beneficial physiologic changes induced by such agents such as phenobarbital and vitamin K and that such pharmacologic therapy must be started during the antenatal period has resulted in significant reductions of severe grades of IVH. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results using these two drugs alone and in combination. Other potentially beneficial drugs such as indomethacin should be investigated. Although the benefits of such therapy may improve perinatal outcome, the emphasis in our discipline should be the continued attempt to prevent the delivery of these VLBW infants. 
Clinical and CT correlates in the diagnosis of intracranial tumours. The correlation between clinical and CT findings in cerebral tumours was prospectively studied in 1191 consecutive referrals for cerebral CT. CT revealed a mass lesion in 51 cases (4.3%): 32 neoplasms, five haematomas and one abscess. The diagnostic specificity of CT for neoplasmic tumours was 86% (32 of 37). The clinical suspicion of a cerebral neoplasm was correct in 25 cases (78%) and the clinical localisatory hypothesis was correct in 20 cases (63%) of the neoplasms. A cerebral tumour was found in 5% (11 out of 226) of patients investigated for their first seizure and in 1% (two of 207) investigated for headache without clinical signs. 
Anorectal physiology testing. A survey of availability and use. Survey forms were sent to all members of the Coloproctology Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons to obtain their opinions of the availability, actual use, and perceived helpfulness of different methods for the evaluation of the physiology of the colon and rectum. Responses revealed a similarity in age and practice patterns in both groups. Of the 19 methods surveyed, greater than 90 percent of respondents in both groups rely on three traditional methods of patient evaluation: patient history, digital examination, and sigmoidoscopy. Four other methods have gained acceptance by the majority of respondents in both groups: colon transit studies, defecography, perfused-catheter manometry, and rectal compliance. The three methods ranked lowest in availability, actual use, and helpfulness by both groups were single-fiber electromyography, use of a perineometer, and evoked potential studies. Our study provides a baseline for future surveys on the investigative efforts of physicians studying the physiology of the colon, rectum, and anus. 
Familial multicentric paragangliomas in a child. A 12-year-old girl presented with bilateral carotid-body paragangliomas and a unilateral jugular paraganglioma. The tumours were surgically removed. This is a rare combination of tumours in any patient and previously unreported in a child of this age. Her father died of a cerebellar astrocytoma and her mother underwent surgical removal of a large mediastinal paraganglioma. The association of astrocytoma with familial paragangliomas has never been documented. The literature on the epidemiology and inheritance pattern of familial paragangliomas is reviewed. The need for thorough pre-operative evaluation of the patient and close follow-up of family members is stressed. 
Role of hepatitis delta virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integrates into the host DNA and shows a series of potentially oncogenetic properties, but HBV is not an acutely transforming virus, because HCC develops decades after infection. Other factors, namely cirrhosis, inflammation, alcohol intake, and viral superinfections, could promote the oncogenetic process induced by HBV-DNA integration. We studied the impact of HDV infection in the pathogenesis of HCC in 62 consecutive patients. Their mean age was 59 years (range 25-75 years), 54 were male and eight female; 58 had cirrhosis. The findings suggest that HBsAg-positive patients with HDV superinfection developed cirrhosis and HCC at an earlier age than HBsAg carriers without HDV infection. HDV appears to represent a "promotion" factor for HCC in subjects with an oncogenic risk induced by HBV. A long-lasting necroinflammatory lesion of the liver substained by productive HBV and HDV infections may be a major pathogenetic mechanism. 
A pilot study of the efficacy and safety of bolus administration of alteplase in acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE--To examine the efficacy, safety, and the pharmacokinetic profile of a bolus dose administration regimen of alteplase in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN--An open pilot study. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--33 suitable consecutive patients presenting within six hours of the onset of symptoms who satisfied the electrocardiographic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS--Two intravenous boluses of 35 mg alteplase, 30 minutes apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Angiographic coronary patency at 90 minutes and 24 hours. Plasma alteplase concentration-time profile and pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS--Coronary patency at 90 minutes: 26 of 30 arteries (87%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 74-99%). Coronary patency at 24 hours: 24 of 29 arteries (83%, CI 69-97%). Mean (SD) plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration reached 4434.8 (2117.8) and 4233.3 (2217.5) ng/ml within 10 minutes of each bolus and fell to 425.8 (288.3) ng/ml between boluses. The estimated peak concentrations at two minutes after boluses were 12,389 (8580) ng/ml and 10,811 (6802) ng/ml. The derived pharmacokinetic variables were volume of distribution 3.11 (1.89) 1, clearance 21.3 (9.3) 1/h, half life 5.9 (1.7) minutes. CONCLUSIONS--This simple administration regimen achieved brief, high concentrations of plasma t-PA that were well tolerated. The regimen was associated with a high coronary patency rate at 90 minutes that was well maintained at 24 hours. 
Altered myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolites in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) of ischemic or idiopathic etiology was assessed at rest by one-dimensional phase-encoded 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies performed in conjunction with 1H imaging in 20 patients with DCM and in 12 normal volunteers. The measured values of anterior myocardial phosphocreatine/beta-adenosine triphosphate (PCr/beta-ATP), corrected for partial saturation and contamination of the spectra by blood metabolites, averaged 1.80 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SE) in normal volunteers and 1.46 +/- 0.07 in the patients overall, a highly significant (p less than 0.001) decrease. In patients with DCM accompanied by coronary artery disease (n = 9), the PCr/beta-ATP ratio averaged 1.53 +/- 0.07, while in those with DCM alone it was 1.41 +/- 0.12 (n = 11), a value that was not significantly different. There was no significant correlation (r = 0.34) between myocardial PCr/ATP ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients. These studies demonstrate that myocardial PCr/ATP ratios are reduced at rest in human ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. 
Angelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures. 
Effect of graded reductions of coronary pressure and flow on myocardial metabolism and performance: a model of "hibernating" myocardium. The term "hibernating" myocardium has been applied to chronic left ventricular dysfunction without angina or ischemic electrocardiographic changes in patients with coronary artery disease that is reversed by therapy that increases myocardial blood flow. To investigate the relation between coronary blood flow and ventricular function experimentally, graded reductions in coronary artery pressure were produced in isolated perfused rat hearts as contractile performance (peak systolic pressure and its first derivative [dP/dt]) and metabolic variables were measured using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As coronary pressure and flow were reduced, significant reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile performance were observed, which returned to control levels when coronary artery pressure and flow were restored to baseline values. Two phases of metabolic abnormality were observed. With modest reductions in coronary perfusion, proportionate reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile behavior were accompanied by a slight reduction in creatine phosphate but no significant lactate production. With greater reductions in coronary artery pressure and flow, creatine phosphate decreased more, adenosine triphosphate levels and myocardial pH decreased significantly and myocardial lactate production increased. The balanced reductions in myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption without metabolic abnormalities traditionally associated with "ischemia" observed in the first phase provides evidence in normal hearts for resetting of the myocardial contractile behavior and oxygen consumption in the presence of reduced coronary flow (that is, hibernating myocardium). The data suggest that reductions in adenosine diphosphate and the index of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (lactate formation) do not explain the coupling between coronary artery pressure and flow and myocardial oxygen consumption as contractile performance decreases. 
Pulmonary and urinary clearance of atrial natriuretic factor in acute congestive heart failure in dogs. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone of cardiac origin elevated in acute congestive heart failure (CHF), which is degraded by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP). This study was designed to investigate the pulmonary and urinary clearance of ANF before and after the initiation of acute experimental CHF in dogs, and to assess the contribution of enzymatic degradation to these clearances in CHF. This study demonstrated a significant clearance of plasma ANF across the pulmonary circulation at baseline, and a tendency for pulmonary clearance to decrease in CHF (1115 +/- 268 to 498 +/- 173 ml/min, NS). The pulmonary extraction of ANF present at baseline was not altered with acute CHF (36.0 +/- 7.8 to 34.9 +/- 12.1%, NS). NEP inhibition (NEPI) abolished both the clearance and extraction of plasma ANF across the lung in CHF. Similarly, significant urinary clearance of ANF was present at baseline, and in acute CHF the urinary clearance of ANF decreased (0.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.02 +/- 0.01 ml/min, P less than 0.05). NEPI prevented the decrease in the urinary clearance of ANF, and enhanced the renal response to endogenous ANF, independent of further increases in plasma ANF during CHF. This study supports an important role for NEP in the pulmonary and urinary metabolism of endogenous ANF during acute CHF. 
Non-trauma mortality in elderly women with low bone mineral density. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. 9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes. 
Reversible inactivation of the insular cortex by tetrodotoxin produces retrograde and anterograde amnesia for inhibitory avoidance and spatial learning. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; a voltage-sensitive sodium channel blocker) was microinjected bilaterally into the insular (IC), frontal (FC), or parietal (PC) cortex or the ventral caudate nucleus of rats either before or after they were trained in an inhibitory avoidance task. When administered either before or after training, injections of TTX into the IC impaired performance on a 48-hr retention test. Injections of TTX into the PC also impaired retention when administered before training. One week later, rats with cannulae in the IC, FC, and PC received microinjections of TTX either before or after training in a water maze (Morris) spatial learning task and retention was tested 24 hr later. TTX impaired retention when administered to the IC either before or after training. These findings indicate that a functionally intact IC during and after training in these tasks appears to be essential for the storage of long-term memory. 
The effect of elemental diet on intestinal permeability and inflammation in Crohn's disease. This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
Secretory diarrhea following a dog bite. Overwhelming sepsis is rarely complicated by secretory diarrhea. We present a case of fulminant sepsis associated with dermatologic manifestations, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a severe secretory diarrhea that has not previously been described. This followed a dog bite, and the patient was otherwise healthy. The combination of septic shock, skin lesions, and DIC occurring after a dog bite has been attributed to dysgonic fermentor 2 organisms, now called Capnocytophaga canimorsus, but none were cultured in this case (7). Dysgonic fermentor-2 may be a new cause of secretory diarrhea and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of overwhelming sepsis associated with diarrhea. 
Long-term efficacy of oral cisapride in symptomatic upper gut dysmotility. We conducted a 12-month trial of cisapride (10 mg three times a day) in 21 patients with gastric stasis due to clinically and manometrically diagnosed gastroparesis (N = 9; seven due to diabetes) or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (N = 12). Radionuclide solid-liquid gastric emptying tests were performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month period. Symptoms were assessed monthly by diary and every three months by the investigators; frequency and severity of symptoms were scored in a standardized manner. For the whole group of 21 patients, gastric emptying of both solids and liquids improved significantly after one year of cisapride (P less than 0.05). Among chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients, there was predominantly an improvement in gastric emptying of solids; in contrast, patients with gastroparesis had a greater improvement in liquid emptying. Total symptom score improved significantly in the gastroparesis group (median score: 8 at baseline vs 6 at one year, P less than 0.05) but not in the chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients (median score at baseline 10 vs 9 at one year). Similarly, body weight showed a trend towards improvement in the gastroparesis group. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that during a 12-month open trial, cisapride was effective in improving gastric emptying in patients with gastric stasis and consistently improved symptoms in those with gastroparesis. 
Growth patterns and prognosis of submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus. A pathologic study. Sixteen cases of esophageal carcinoma invading the submucosa were analyzed in terms of growth patterns. Seven were classified into the massively penetrating (down growth) type, four into the superficially spreading (spreading growth) type, and five into the unclassified type. In the down growth type, the ratio of the submucosal area to the total (mucosa and submucosa) area was more than 0.2 (one fifth), and in the others that ratio was less than 0.2. The down growth type is characterized by a tendency toward elevated lesions, a high incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a poor prognosis after surgery. Lymphatic and/or vascular invasions were recognized in six of seven cases, and the 5-year survival rate was 0%. In contrast, the spreading growth and unclassified types was characterized by superficial lesions, a low incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a favorable prognosis. In only one with the spreading growth type was there lymphatic invasion. Three of the four with the spreading growth type survived over 5 years, and the other one with the spreading growth type and all of five with the unclassified type are alive without recurrences 15 to 52 months after surgery. Thus, growth patterns reflect well the prognosis of the submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus. 
Cerebral balloon angioplasty for treatment of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty can offer marked improvement to selected patients with ischemic deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm. Vasospasm resulting from subarachnoid hemorrhage related to aneurysmal rupture or occurring during detachable balloon embolization therapy for treatment of an aneurysm has responded to angioplasty when conventional methods have failed. Indications, appropriate timing, patient selection, and nursing implications for cerebral angioplasty are discussed in this article. 
Home blood pressure monitoring for mild hypertensives. A clinical trial of 204 untreated patients with mild hypertension was conducted to assess the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure level, pharmacologic treatment, reduction of risk factors, and use of health services. After 1 year, no statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups. The findings indicate that, while home blood pressure monitoring may be useful, it has no measurable short-term impact on these aspects of blood pressure management for patients with mild hypertension. 
Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. 
Isoflurane partially preserves energy balance in isolated hepatocytes during in vitro anoxia. We investigated whether a volatile anesthetic (1.5% isoflurane or 1.0% halothane) or an added anaerobic energy source (10 mM glucose or fructose) could act directly on liver cells to protect energy status during 20-30 min of anoxia. We used hepatocytes freshly isolated from fed rats or rats that had fasted, suspended them in Krebs' buffer, and incubated them in sealed flasks under O2/CO2 or N2/CO2 (95%:5%). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio (ATP/ADP) measured cellular energy balance--the balance between overall ATP supply and demand. Lactate levels measured the extent to which ATP was supplied by the nonmitochondrial pathway, (anaerobic) glycolysis. Maximum values of energy balance were seen in cells from fed rats incubated in the presence of glucose and O2. When glucose was replaced by fructose, ATP/ADP decreased and lactate increased. During anoxia (O2 replaced by N2), increases in lactate were also seen with glucose; and ATP/ADP decreased to similarly low values with both substrates. In cells from fasted rats, ATP/ADP decreased significantly below the value for cells from fed rats only in the presence of glucose and O2. Compared with cells from fed rats, cells from fasted rats showed decreased lactate in the face of decreased ATP/ADP, suggesting that glycolysis was impaired. Isoflurane partially prevented anoxia-induced decreases in ATP/ADP. This protective effect on energy balance occurred equally with glucose and fructose, but was not seen in cells from fasted rats or with halothane. Thus, 1 MAC isoflurane and some factor(s) related to the fed state combined to protect partially the energy balance in anoxic liver cells through action(s) at the cellular level. 
CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System--short form (CARES-SF). A cancer specific rehabilitation and quality of life instrument. The CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES) (CARES Consultants, Santa Monica, CA) a rehabilitation and quality of life instrument with well-documented reliability and validity, has been shortened. This report describes the development and psychometric properties of the new instrument, the CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System--Short Form (CARES-SF). The data from four existing samples of cancer patients demonstrate that the CARES-SF is highly related to the CARES (r = 0.98), has excellent test-retest reliability (86% agreement), concurrent validity with related measures, and acceptable internal consistency of summary scales (alpha = 0.85 to 0.61). In a new sample of breast cancer patients evaluated at three points in time (1 month, 7 months, and 13 months after diagnosis) the instrument appears to be sensitive to change and is highly related to the Functional Living Index--Cancer (FLIC), an existing quality of life instrument. The authors conclude that the CARES-SF has excellent potential as a quality of life instrument for use in clinical trials. 
A prospective evaluation of hepatic resection for colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver: Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group Protocol 6584. We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival. 
Cytofluorometric analysis of metastases from lung adenocarcinoma with special reference to the difference between hematogenous and lymphatic metastases. Metastatic tumors in the brain, liver, and regional lymph nodes (20 cases each) from patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were examined by cytofluorometric analysis, and compared with the respective primary lung tumors. The nuclear DNA content of tumor cells was significantly increased in metastatic tumors in the brain and liver compared with the primary (P less than 0.01). However, the DNA content of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes was almost identical to that of the primary tumor in many instances. From the viewpoint of the nuclear DNA content of lung adenocarcinoma, blood-borne tumor cells in the brain and liver were considered likely to constitute a discrete tumor cell subpopulation, i.e., probably a more malignant one, different from the major subpopulation in the primary tumor, whereas lymphatic metastases in regional lymph nodes were similar to the primary. The subpopulation with an increased DNA content in hematogenous metastases were thought to have originated from a minor subpopulation in the primary tumor or to have developed at the metastatic site. 
Ovulation induction with gonadotropins in women with polycystic ovary disease. Seventy-two infertile women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) and clomiphene citrate treatment failure underwent 220 human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment cycles for ovulation induction over a period of 19 months. Forty-two patients ovulated but failed to conceive on clomiphene, and the remaining 30 failed to ovulate on clomiphene. Monitoring of treatment consisted of serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels and ultrasonic assessment of follicular growth. Treatment was withheld whenever the E2 levels exceeded 1,500 pg/mL and/or when more than two follicles greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter each were encountered on ultrasonography. Twenty-nine patients conceived (40.2%), and 23 delivered viable infants. Twenty-three of the 29 pregnancies were achieved in the 42 patients who ovulated on clomiphene, while only 6 pregnancies resulted in the 32 anovulatory patients on clomiphene. Six patients (20.6%) aborted in the first trimester. Multiple pregnancies consisted of only two sets of twins (6.9%). There were only two cases of mild hyperstimulation (2.7%) and no severe hyperstimulation. Because of the low occurrence of multiple pregnancies and hyperstimulation and the reasonable success rate, all PCOD patients should be started on this protocol. 
A randomized study of cisplatin versus cisplatin plus vindesine for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Between August 1983 and March 1985, a randomized study was conducted that compared cisplatin (CDDP) (80 mg/m2 on day 1) alone with CDDP plus vindesine (VDS) (3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) in 160 consecutive patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There were no complete responses. The response rate for CDDP plus VDS (22 of 77 patients, 29%) was significantly higher than that for CDDP alone (9 of 78 patients, 12%) (P less than 0.05). However, no difference existed in the median duration of response (20 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 20 weeks for CDDP alone) or the median survival time (45 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 39 weeks for CDDP alone). No significant differences in toxicity were detected between the two arms; myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy occurred more frequently with CDDP plus VDS and there was one lethal episode of hepatorenal syndrome in the CDDP plus VDS arm. Among the variables Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), age, sex, stage, weight loss, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, albumin level, histologic cell type, and chemotherapy arm, only chemotherapy arm was a significant factor leading to a major response (P = 0.019, multiple logistic regression analysis). The significant predictors of survival were PS (P = 0.000), sex (P = 0.000), and stage (P = 0.002) (Cox's proportional hazards model), with a PS of 0 or 1, female sex, and lower stage yielding the best survival. Although a significantly higher response rate was obtained in the combination arm than in the single agent arm, the survival benefit to patients receiving such combination chemotherapy was not determined and more effective chemotherapy regimens are required. 
Hyperreactivity of tubuloglomerular feedback in chronically salt-loaded spontaneous hypertensive rats. In order to investigate the mechanisms of the hyperreactivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) the resetting of TGF by chronic dietary NaCl loading was studied in SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). This treatment is known to reset the TGF by an inhibitory factor in tubular fluid and not by alterations of the intrinsic characteristics of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). TGF reactivity, and its resetting, were determined by loop of Henle perfusion with artificial late proximal tubular fluid and with harvested endogenous tubular fluid respectively. Dietary effects of the high sodium intake were measured by means of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma volume (PV), and renal sodium excretion. The 4-week dietary treatment had no significant influence on SBP in WKY, whereas it accelerated the rise of SBP in SHR significantly. After 1 week of treatment, PV was increased in both WKY and SHR as compared with the control groups kept on the normal diet. Whereas PV in WKY declined to control values over the next 3 weeks, SHR remained expanded. GFR was similar in all groups, whereas urinary sodium excretion was significantly increased in salt-loaded SHR and WKY. Dietary salt loading was paralleled by the appearance of a TGF-inhibiting substance in the tubular fluid in SHR and WKY. However, when assayed with artificial late proximal tubular fluid, hyperreactivity was similar in normal and salt-loaded SHR as compared with WKY. Thus, in SHR TGF hyperreactivity is maintained in spite of volume expansion and TGF resetting by a humoral factor in tubular fluid. 
Supraventricular tachycardia. Changes in management. The various forms of supraventricular tachycardia can be differentiated by careful review of a patient's electrocardiogram. If reentrant tachycardia involves the atrioventricular node, intravenous adenosine (Adenocard) provides a rapid means of converting the tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Adverse effects of adenosine, though common, are mild and of brief duration. Wide QRS complex tachycardia of ventricular origin is usually not affected by the drug. 
Three-port perineal sparing technique. The records were reviewed of 103 patients with low-lying pelvic malignancies irradiated with a skin-sparing technique involving use of a pair of anteroposterior-posteroanterior opposed ports and a direct perineal port. Patients had rectal, anal, cervical, vaginal, urethral, or vulvar cancer. Use of a special lead compensator allowed the three beams to be applied perpendicularly to the surface, while delivery of a homogeneous dose to the pelvis and perineum was maintained. Skin dose with this method was greatly reduced compared with that delivered with simple opposing or four-port techniques, in which irradiation is tangential to the surface at the perineum. Acute perineal skin irritation was assigned a grade between 0 and 3, with grade 0 representing the least amount of irritation. All patients were in the grade 0 or grade 1 category. Patients treated for low-lying rectal carcinoma showed no increase in perineal recurrences when compared with historic control subjects. Use of this approach allowed delivery of adequate doses to the pelvis and perineum and a definite decrease in local toxic effects, and local control was not compromised. 
Pancreatic lesions in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Common manifestations of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, an autosomally dominant inherited cancer-prone disorder, include retinal angiomatosis, hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system, renal cysts, renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and epididymal cystadenoma. Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome. In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied. Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging. Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging. For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available. Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%). One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome. In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy. Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment. Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations. In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis. 
Cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. To determine the cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin) for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, we used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a computer-stimulated model that estimates the risk factor-specific annual incidence of coronary heart disease and the risk of recurrent coronary events in persons with prevalent coronary heart disease. When used for secondary prevention, 20 mg/d of lovastatin was estimated to save lives and save costs in younger men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L) and to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio regardless of the cholesterol level except in young women with cholesterol levels below 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). Doses of 40 mg/d of lovastatin had favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). By comparison, primary prevention had favorable cost-effectiveness ratios only in selected subgroups based on cholesterol levels and other established risk factors. We conclude that current national recommendations regarding medication for secondary prevention are not as aggressive as our projections would suggest, while recommendations regarding the use of medications for primary prevention should consider the cost of medication as well as the risk factor profile of the individual patient. 
Investigation of colonic prostaglandins in carcinogenesis in the rat colon. Large bowel carcinoma was induced in rats by injecting MNNG intrarectally, and changes in the large bowel mucosa prostaglandin (PG) with time were determined. The PGE2 levels of the colonic mucosa in a control group were 20.9 +/- 9.7 (pg/mg total protein) at 5 weeks, 25.5 +/- 9.7 at 10 weeks, 26.5 +/- 18.1 at 20 weeks, and 34.8 +/- 12.7 at 40 weeks. The PGE2 levels in the MNNG-treated group were 44.7 +/- 6.2 at 5 weeks, 43.1 +/- 14.9 at 10 weeks, 70.1 +/- 23.4 at 20 weeks, and 79.7 +/- 54.1 at 40 weeks. The intrinsic PGE2 levels of the noncancerous mucosa were thus significantly higher for the MNNG group than for the control group at all weeks. At 40 weeks, the PGE2 levels of cancer lesions were significantly high compared with those of the noncancerous area. In the cancerous lesions, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha decreased and TXB2 increased significantly at 40 weeks. The observations demonstrated that PGE2 was implicated as a promoter in the development and proliferation of carcinoma in MNNG-induced large bowel carcinogenesis in rats. 
Inverted papilloma of the urinary bladder with granular eosinophilic cells. An unusual neuroendocrine variant. We report the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic characteristics observed in a case of an inverted papilloma that contained neuroendocrine cells resected from the urinary bladder of a 77-year-old woman. Additionally, we evaluated the incidence of neuroendocrine cells in eight cases of inverted papillomas of the urinary bladder obtained from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC. To our knowledge, an in-depth study of neuroendocrine cells in this neoplasm and a comparison of the same with neuroendocrine cells observed in other conditions in the lower genitourinary tract have not been previously published, prompting this report. 
Streptococcus salivarius meningitis and colonic carcinoma. Streptococcus salivarius caused fulminant meningitis in an elderly patient. A gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an asymptomatic colonic adenocarcinoma. This first reported instance of S salivarius sepsis associated with a colonic neoplasm is not unexpected, since the organism is bacteriologically similar to S bovis, the prime bacterial indicator of occult malignancy. Exact speciation of streptococcal strains is fraught with technical difficulties, and gastrointestinal investigation may be warranted in an expanded variety of streptococcal infections. 
Spinal cord protection during aortic occlusion: efficacy of intrathecal tetracaine. Spinal cord ischemia and resultant paraplegia are devastating sequelae in up to 40% of patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We investigated the effect of intrathecal tetracaine on the neurological sequelae of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion with aortic occlusion. Cocaine-derived anesthetics (lidocaine and its analogues) have been shown to decrease neuronal cell metabolism and also have specific neuronal membrane stabilizing effects. New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and spinal cord ischemia was then induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. Animals were divided into six treatment groups. Tetracaine (groups 2 and 4) or normal saline solution (group 5) was administered intrathecally before aortic cross-clamping. Groups 1 and 3 functioned as controls. Group 6 animals received intravenous thiopental. Rabbits were classified as either neurologically normal or injured (paralyzed or paretic). Among controls, 25 minutes of aortic occlusion produced varied neurological sequelae (group 1, 3/6 injured, 50%) whereas 30 minutes resulted in more consistent injury (group 3, 5/6 injured, 83%). All rabbits that received intrathecal saline solution were paralyzed (group 5, 4/4 injured, 100%). Animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion of 30 minutes (group 4) showed significantly better preservation of neurological function (6/7 normal, 86%) than controls and saline-treated animals (groups 3 and 5). All animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion for 25 minutes (group 2) showed no signs of injury (5/5 normal, 100%), but this was not significant versus controls (group 1). Intravenous thiopental (group 6, 5/5 injured, 100%) had no beneficial effect. Intrathecal tetracaine significantly and dramatically abrogated the neurological injury secondary to spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion after aortic occlusion at 30 minutes in the rabbit model. 
Could recurrent cholangitis after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy be explained by motor intestinal anomalies? A manometric study. The aim of this study was to describe the motor patterns found in two patients with recurrent cholangitis episodes after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In one patient, cholangitis was due to a stenosis of the anastomosis between the limb and the left intrahepatic bile duct, while motility of the limb, duodenum, and distal jejunum was normal. In the second patient, no anatomical explanation was found for cholangitis attacks. However, although the duodenal motor activity was normal, the motility of the limb and of the jejunum below the jejunojejunal anastomosis was grossly abnormal: permanent minute rhythm, phase IIIs absent or rare and slowly propagated, all motor abnormalities that could promote bacterial overgrowth in the limb. This stresses the interest in performing motor studies of the Roux-limb when cholangitis remains unexplained after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. 
Human galanin: molecular cloning reveals a unique structure. Galanin, a novel neuropeptide/hypothalamic hormone originally identified and isolated by virtue of its carboxy-terminal amide group, has recently been shown to have a diverse range of biological activities, including potent effects on the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. The physiological role of galanin remains unclear, with different effects being observed when porcine and rat galanin have been used in various animal model systems and in human studies. Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding human galanin and galanin mRNA associated peptide (GMAP) from both pituitary and neuroblastoma sources has revealed a unique and unexpected structure. In contrast to porcine, bovine and rodent galanin, human galanin lacks a carboxy-terminal amide. By analogy to other neurohormones, the absence of carboxy-terminal amidation would be expected to have significant effects on functional properties such as affinity for different receptor subtypes and physiological half life, and may be responsible for the species specificity observed in the action of galanin. 
Tissue responses to degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint: a review. The articular cartilage covering of the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence, as well as the tissue of the articular disc, may be affected by degenerative changes associated with osteoarthrosis. Degenerative changes of cartilage alter its physical properties and, as a result, affect its ability to withstand compressive and shearing stresses. Increased friction between the articular surfaces may impair joint movement and may elicit compensatory or pathologic responses of the cartilage and the adjacent tissues, such as capsule and ligaments, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and associated musculature. In this review, these structural changes are described and related to common signs and symptoms of craniomandibular dysfunction, such as clicking, locking and instability, pain and tenderness, restricted ranges of mandibular motion, crepitation, deformity, muscle wasting, and changes of occlusion. 
Diagnosis and monitoring of subarachnoid hemorrhage by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Thirty-six patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (26 caused by rupture of an aneurysm) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications. 
The natural history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Highly uncommon or highly unrecognized? Among 2000 descendants of an English immigrant to Tasmania, Australia, the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 was found to be very highly probable or highly probable in 130 and moderately probable in 22. Another 242 children and siblings were 50% likely to have inherited this dominant gene. In all age groups, especially the elderly, the majority of affected members had symptoms of only one endocrine disorder or were asymptomatic. In teenagers, the most common presentation was pituitary lesions and the second most common presentation was insulinomas. Frequently, pituitary lesions or insulinomas developed before any parathyroid lesions could be detected. Elevation of gastrin levels, usually associated with hypercalcemia, was rarely seen in patients younger than 25 years. The classic presentation with symptoms of multiple endocrinopathy may represent only a small fraction of these patients in the community. 
Exacerbation of psoriasis after megavoltage irradiation. The Koebner phenomenon. This is a case report of a patient with a known history of psoriasis who experienced an exacerbation after palliative treatment with high-energy irradiation. A discussion of the radiobiology is presented. 
Right ventricular pacing and left ventricular filling pattern. An echo-Doppler study. The influence of right ventricular pacing on left ventricular filling has not been completely clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the possible alteration in and effects on left ventricular filling resulting from right ventricular pacing. The study population consisted of two groups; group A was comprised of 12 patients with a spontaneous left bundle branch block, and group B had 12 patients without left bundle branch block. All the patients underwent an interrogation of the mitral valve inflow by Doppler echocardiography, in order to measure isovolumic relaxation time, early and late peak velocity (E and A wave), E/A ratio and deceleration time. The study was performed at spontaneous rhythm and after, inhibition of the pacemaker. In group A, there were no changes in the Doppler parameters when passing from a spontaneous to an 80/min electrically induced rhythm. Analysis of group B revealed a statistically significant lengthening of IVR and Dec t with electrical stimulation. No statistically significant differences were found when we compared the Doppler parameters of the two populations at the same pacing frequency. Right ventricular pacing causes interventricular asynchrony and abnormalities in diastolic filling times, which resulted in a lengthening of either IVR and Dec t, simulating a pattern of abnormal relaxation. 
Malignant colorectal strictures in Crohn's disease. One hundred thirty-two of 980 patients (13.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD) involving the colon, admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1985, developed 175 colonic strictures. Thirty-three patients developed more than one stricture. The frequency was twice as great in colitis (19%) as in ileocolitis (11%). Ten malignant strictures were identified in nine patients (three ileocolitis, six colitis). One of these patients had three strictures (two malignant, and one benign), and two had two strictures (one malignant and one benign). The frequency of cancer in patients with stricture (6.8%) was higher than in those without stricture (0.7%, six of 848, p less than 0.001). There were no differences in clinical symptoms between patients with benign and malignant stricture. Seventeen of 165 benign strictures (10.3%) were long, extending over more than one anatomical segment of colon, but all 10 malignant strictures were short (p less than 0.0001). The age at the diagnosis of stricture was higher in the nine patients with malignant stricture than in the 123 patients with benign stricture (mean age 57.2 vs. 41.4 yr, respectively, p less than 0.01). The proportion of strictures that were malignant increased with duration of disease from 3.3% with less than 20 yr of CD, to 11% with CD of 20 yr or more. All nine patients with malignant stricture were treated surgically, and four of the nine died of colon cancer during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr. Prognosis was worse in six other nonstricture cancers in this series, with five colon cancer deaths during mean follow-up of 1.6 yr. In view of the high rate of malignancy, 6.8% in this series, colonoscopy with biopsy is essential in Crohn's disease patients with colonic strictures, and surgery must be considered when a stricture cannot be fully assessed during colonoscopy. 
Drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: an unusual complication. A 34-year-old white woman had external drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst. During sinography, contrast medium filled perigastric varices, causing septic shock. From this experience, we believe that although sinograms are helpful, they should be preceded by prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that contrast material should be sterile. The drainage catheter should be removed as soon as possible. 
Kistrin, a polypeptide platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, enhances and sustains coronary arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in a canine preparation BACKGROUND. Kistrin is a 68-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma, which inhibits the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Its effect on thrombolysis, reocclusion, and bleeding associated with administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Coronary patency was monitored for 2 hours by ultrasonic flow probe and repeated coronary angiography. The rt-PA was given as 0.45-mg/kg bolus injections at 15-minute intervals until recanalization or to a maximum of four boluses. Four groups of four or five dogs were studied: a control group that received intravenous heparin (4,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units each hour) and three groups that received heparin and 0.48, 0.24, or 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, administered as a 10% bolus injection and an infusion during a 60-minute period. In the control group, reflow occurred in four of five dogs within 37 +/- 47 minutes but was followed by cyclic reflow and reocclusion. Kistrin at a dose of 0.48 and 0.24 mg/kg reduced the time to reflow to 6 +/- 5 and 10 +/- 3 minutes, respectively, and abolished reocclusion. With 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, reflow occurred in all four animals, within 27 +/- 23 minutes, and reocclusion occurred in two animals. Kistrin induced a dose-related prolongation of the template bleeding time: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, the bleeding time was prolonged from 3.8 +/- 1.3 minutes before infusion to 29 +/- 2 minutes during infusion, but it was shortened to 8.3 +/- 2.6 minutes at 90 minutes after the end of infusion. Kistrin also caused a dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation with ADP and collagen: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, platelet aggregation was abolished during the infusion but had partially recovered toward the end of the observation period. Pathological examination of recanalized coronary arterial segments of dogs given 0.48 or 0.24 mg/kg kistrin revealed widely patent arteries with some platelets layered on the damaged intimal surface. CONCLUSIONS. Kistrin increases the rate and extent of thrombolysis with a reduced dose of rt-PA, and it prevents reocclusion. At an effective dose, it is associated with a transient prolongation of the bleeding time and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kistrin may offer promise as adjunctive treatment to thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of Ewing's sarcoma cell surface antigen p30/32MIC2. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) HBA71, which was raised against Ewing's sarcoma cells, recognizes a cell-surface glycoprotein, p30/32MIC2, that is encoded by the MIC2 gene in the pseudoautosomal region of human chromosomes X and Y. This immunohistochemical study evaluates the specificity and sensitivity of MAb HBA71 for tumor diagnosis. Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues of more than 300 tumors of diverse histologic type, including more than 100 small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence, were tested with this MAb by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure. The authors found HBA71 immunoreactivity in 61 of 63 Ewing's sarcomas studied and 9 of 11 primitive neuroectodermal tumors and peripheral neuroepitheliomas. HBA71-negative tumors included neuroblastomas (0 of 24), melanomas (0 of 13), an esthesioneuroblastoma, small cell osteosarcomas (0 of 2), a malignant ectomesenchymoma, desmoplastic SRCT (0 of 5), and medulloblastomas (0 of 5). Heterogeneous expression of HBA71 immunostaining was found in some embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (3 of 14) and astrocytomas (4 of 7), and in a few neuroendocrine tumors (4 of 26), carcinomas (3 of 94), and lymphomas (6 of 30). Because Ewing's sarcomas are consistently HBA71 positive, the authors searched for antigen-positive normal cells that may represent precursors for these tumors; however, no obvious candidate for the elusive cell of origin for Ewing's sarcoma was identified in the normal fetal tissues tested. Their findings indicate that HBA71 is a highly restricted cell-surface antigen of Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and immunohistochemistry employing this antibody may be of value in the differential diagnosis of selected small round cell tumors in childhood and adolescence. 
The significance of critical care errors in causing preventable death in trauma patients in a trauma system. The regionalization of trauma care has led to a decrease in preventable death after injury. This decrease has been attributed to earlier resuscitation and surgical intervention. Little emphasis, however, has focused on the critical care phase of trauma patient management. This study was undertaken to determine the significance of critical care errors (CCEs) on preventable mortality and morbidity in a regionalized system of trauma care. The records of 12,910 trauma patients admitted to six trauma centers over a three-year period were reviewed. The cause and preventability of death was determined by a panel of trauma experts. Critical care errors occurred in 151 (23%) of all patients with errors occurring during any phase of care. The CCEs were identified in 38 of 125 (30%) deaths of patients with errors in some phase of care. The CCEs were implicated as the cause of death in 30 (48%) of the 62 preventable deaths. The proportion of preventable deaths attributable to CCEs was higher than the proportion of preventable death attributable to errors in the resuscitative and operative phases of care (p less than 0.001, chi-square). These data indicate that CCEs significantly contribute to preventable mortality and morbidity in trauma patients. It is imperative that physicians caring for trauma patients possess expertise in the critical care management of injured patients. 
Stump pressure, the contralateral carotid artery, and electroencephalographic changes. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and measurement of stump pressure are the most widely employed methods of assessing the risk of cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. The status of the contralateral carotid artery has also been thought to influence the need for placing a shunt. The relationship of EEG monitoring, stump pressure, and the contralateral carotid artery has not been completely delineated. We retrospectively reviewed these three variables in 113 patients undergoing 124 carotid endarterectomies. The contralateral artery was classified as occluded, stenotic (greater than 50% decrease in diameter), or nonstenotic. There was a 48% incidence of EEG changes with contralateral occlusion, 18% with stenosis, and 21% with nonstenotic arteries (p = 0.014). There was a 73% incidence of EEG changes when the stump pressure was less than 25 mm Hg, 32% when the stump pressure was 25 to 50 mm Hg, and 2% when the stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean stump pressure for patients with occlusion (43.8 mm Hg), stenosis (44.7 mm Hg), or nonstenotic contralateral arteries (51.3 mm Hg). All patients with contralateral occlusion and a stump pressure less than 25 mm Hg had EEG changes. No patient with a stump pressure greater than 50 mm Hg and a patent contralateral artery had EEG changes. Although the incidence of EEG changes in the majority of patients was not accurately predicted by the stump pressure and the status of the contralateral carotid artery, stump pressure less than or equal to 50 mm Hg was sensitive, identifying 97% of patients with EEG changes. 
Left atrial ball thrombus: review of clinical and echocardiographic manifestations with suggestions for management. Left atrial ball thrombus is an infrequent clinical syndrome, which can have a catastrophic outcome but can be readily treated when recognized. It is usually a complication of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis. Symptomatic presentation is variable: fragmentation of the thrombus followed by peripheral embolization will produce ischemia or infarction of myocardium, brain, viscera, or extremities; random, intermittent, partial, or total occlusion of the mitral valve orifice may cause syncope, pulmonary congestion, and occasionally sudden death in other patients. Embolic and obstructive phenomena may also occur together. Cardiac physical findings usually suggest mitral stenosis; variability in the intensity of the diastolic rumble is common. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the gold standard for identifying ball thrombus. Cardiac catheterization provides assessment of coronary artery status when needed. The outcome of untreated ball thrombus is unlikely to be favorable. The results of anticoagulation and thrombolysis are unpredictable and potentially as harmful as no treatment at all. Current evidence although scant suggests that prompt surgical removal of the free thrombus, often in conjunction with mitral valve repair or replacement, is the appropriate therapeutic course in most patients. 
Sudden asphyxial death due to a prolapsed esophageal fibrolipoma. Fibrolipomas of the esophagus are extremely uncommon benign tumors. Accurate diagnosis and resection are essential, due to their tendency to become impacted and obstruct the airway. The case is presented of a 56-year-old man who died suddenly of asphyxia because of upper airway obstruction by a prolapsed fibrolipoma of the esophagus. 
Left and right ventricular systolic function and exercise capacity with coronary artery disease. This prospective study of symptom-limited supine ergometry was conducted to determine the contributions of right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) systolic function to the exercise capacity of a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with unstable angina, angiographically proven CAD (n = 53) and stable symptoms after medical therapy or angioplasty were included. Documented myocardial infarction (greater than or equal to 2 weeks before exercise) was present in 43 of 53 patients. Angina was the limiting symptom in 11 of 53; the other 42 stopped exercise with dyspnea or fatigue, or both. Oxygen consumption was measured on-line during exercise with a metabolic cart. RV ejection fraction and LV ejection fraction were measured by validated methods from gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography. There were weak but statistically significant correlations between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise RV ejection fraction (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05) and between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise LV ejection fraction (r = 0.38, p less than 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis, including exercise RV ejection fraction, exercise LV ejection fraction and exercise heart rate versus exercise oxygen consumption revealed a better relation (r = 0.48, p less than 0.005) than any variable in univariate regression. The values of RV and LV ejection fraction at rest did not correlate significantly (r = 0.2, difference not significant), but the exercise values did correlate weakly (r = 0.41, p less than 0.01). The reserve of LV ejection fraction, defined as exercise minus rest value, correlated weakly with exercise oxygen consumption (r = 0.32, p less than 0.05). 
Resection of the inferior vena cava or intraluminal vena caval tumor thrombectomy during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell cancer: indications and results. A total of 42 patients underwent inferior vena caval resection (40) or intraluminal tumor thrombectomy (2) during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for bulky abdominal metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (7% of all post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection cases). The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options. 
Transplant aspiration cytology: applications to kidney and liver transplantations. In summary, cytologic monitoring of renal and liver transplants is a well established diagnostic procedure. The prime value of the FNAB relates to the posttransplantation perioperative period: the acute alterations in the transplant, such as acute rejection and the differential diagnoses, can be established in most cases. However, evaluation of vascular patterns of rejection, in particular chronic rejection, is impossible to obtain from the FNAB. A needle core biopsy is needed. 
Influence of the site of tumor growth on the capacity of a low tumorigenic line of Friend erythroleukemia cells to differentiate. Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) passaged in mice are highly tumorigenic and multiply extensively in the livers of suckling DBA/2 mice without differentiating. In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells. It is concluded that the tumorigenicity of FLCs depended on the site of tumor growth and that there is an inverse correlation between the tumorigenic capacity and the capacity to differentiate. 
Airway pressure release ventilation in severe acute respiratory failure Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), a new ventilatory support technique, was compared with conventional intermittent positive-pressure ventilation plus PEEP (CPPV) in 18 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Patients were initially stabilized on CPPV and then switched to APRV. The APRV provided effective ventilatory support in 17 of 18 patients; APRV achieved similar levels of alveolar ventilation as CPPV (for APRV, mean PaCO2 = 45.0 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; vs for CPPV, mean PaCO2 = 43.3 +/- 5.7 mm Hg), with significantly lower mean maximum airway pressures (38.9 +/- 10.1 cm H2O vs 64.6 +/- 15.4 cm H2O; p = 0.0001) and mean VT (0.79 +/- 0.11 L vs 1.05 +/- 0.15 L; p = 0.0002). No significant differences in mean airway pressure, end-expiratory pressure, FIO2, ventilator rate, arterial blood gas levels, and hemodynamic function were noted between APRV and CPPV. 
Left-sided pleural effusion secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. A previously unrecognized relationship. The association of left-sided pleural effusion and subcapsular splenic hematoma was reported in 1980. We describe a patient in whom a left-sided pleural effusion resulted from splenic vein thrombosis, a relationship not previously reported. Splenectomy was performed, demonstrating the spleen to be enlarged and hemorrhagic. The pleural effusion did not recur after splenectomy. The three effusions due to splenic hematomas reported previously cleared only after splenectomy, suggesting splenectomy may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation. We propose possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend that splenic vein thrombosis be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained left-sided pleural effusions. 
Hypocalciuria of preeclampsia is independent of parathyroid hormone level. Hypocalciuria is a feature of preeclampsia. The roles of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) in its pathogenesis have not yet been determined. Fourteen preeclamptic women were compared with 12 women with chronic hypertension and 11 normotensives, all in the third trimester. Preeclamptics had the lowest urinary calcium excretion rate (62.1 +/- 32.8 mg/24 hours) compared with chronic hypertensive women (162.6 +/- 97.8 mg/24 hours) and normotensive controls (225.6 = 146.9 mg/24 hours) (P less than .05). Serum PTH was lowest in preeclamptics (9.8 +/- 5.5 pg/mL), in contrast to the chronic hypertensives (18.5 +/- 2.7 pg/mL) and normotensives (16.4 +/- 3.2 pg/mL) (P less than .005). Similarly, urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) excretion was 2.9 +/- 1.4 mumol/24 hours in the preeclamptics, 5.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/24 hours in the chronic hypertensives, and 4.6 +/- 1.3 mumol/24 hours in the normotensive group (P less than .05). These data suggest that the mechanism of hypocalciuria in preeclampsia is independent of the PTH-calcitriol axis. Therefore, it is suggested that the hypocalciuria of preeclampsia is due to intrinsic renal tubular dysfunction. 
Development of sustained achlorhydria in a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with omeprazole. Spontaneous remission of gastric acid hypersecretion in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs rarely. This study shows the development of gastric secretory mucosal atrophy resulting in achlorhydria and loss of pepsin secretion in a 63-year-old woman with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Reduced secretion began soon after starting treatment with omeprazole, and achlorhydria became complete 6 months later. The patient remains well with normal endoscopy results and is achlorhydric 4 years after the start of treatment and 34 months after stopping omeprazole. She was not colonized with Helicobacter pylori until 36 months after developing achlorhydria. Serum gastrin has increased from 1000 to between 5000 and 12,500 ng/L (pg/mL), was not suppressible by gastric acidification, and was not associated with G-cell hyperplasia. She also has a normal Schilling test and normal immunoglobulins, and lacks antibodies to parietal cells or H+, K(+)-ATPase. Moderate enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia is apparent for the first time on the latest biopsy sample. 
Acetylcholine receptor-reactive T lymphocytes from healthy subjects and myasthenia gravis patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 23 of 114 (20%) myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed positive T-cell proliferative responses to native acetylcholine receptor (AChR) purified from the electric fish Torpedo, compared with two of 25 (8%) healthy or other neurologic disease controls. Responsiveness appeared to fluctuate seasonally. Long-term T-cell lines and clones could be selected as readily from the two healthy responders as from the MG cases and showed similar culture behavior, CD4+ phenotype, and HLA class II restrictions. One clone from a control cross-reacted with recombinant human AChR alpha chain (r37-429A) and with the synthetic peptide 125-143(S-S) from its sequence. Both these human antigens stimulated primary proliferative responses at substantially higher frequencies (26 to 59%) than native xeno-AChR--in both patients and controls--demonstrating that truly autoreactive T cells are not inevitably deleted during normal T-cell development. 
Evaluation of pulmonary venous flow by transesophageal echocardiography in subjects with a normal heart: comparison with transthoracic echocardiography Nineteen normal subjects and five patients with atrial fibrillation underwent transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiographic studies to evaluate the normal pulmonary venous flow pattern, compare right and left pulmonary venous flow and assess the effect of sample volume location on pulmonary venous flow velocities. Best quality tracings were obtained by transesophageal echocardiography. Anterograde flow during systole and diastole was observed in all patients by both techniques. Reversed flow during atrial contraction was observed with transesophageal echocardiography in 18 of the 19 subjects in normal sinus rhythm, but in only 7 subjects with transthoracic echocardiography. Two forward peaks during ventricular systole were clearly identified in 14 subjects (73%) with transesophageal echocardiography, but in none with the transthoracic technique. The early systolic wave immediately followed the reversed flow during atrial contraction and was strongly related to the timing of atrial contraction (r = 0.78; p less than 0.001), but not to the timing of ventricular contraction, and appeared to be secondary to atrial relaxation. Conversely, the late systolic wave was temporally related to ventricular ejection (r = 0.66; p less than 0.001), peaking 100 ms before the end of the aortic valve closure and was unrelated to atrial contraction time. Quantitatively, significantly higher peak systolic flow velocities were obtained in the left upper pulmonary vein compared with the right upper pulmonary vein (60 +/- 17 vs. 52 +/- 15 cm/s; p less than 0.05) and by transesophageal echocardiography compared with transthoracic studies (60 +/- 17 vs. 50 +/- 14 cm/s; p less than 0.05). Increasing depth of interrogation beyond 1 cm from the vein orifice resulted in a significant decrease in the number of interpretable tracings. 
Delayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism. In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results. 
Local cardiac responses--alternative methods of control. Much attention has been paid to the influence of the beta-adrenoceptor system on cardiac function in heart failure. Full agonists and partial agonists acting on cardiac beta 1 receptors have been widely investigated, as has the density of these receptors in the failing heart. However, other cardiac control mechanisms may play important roles in the normal heart as well as in heart failure. The Frank-Starling mechanism of enhanced cardiac contraction produced by mechanical stretching of the ventricular myofibrils is well known. When treating patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators and other drugs that influence preload, it is important to consider their overall effects in relation to the Starling curves. Atrial stretching also produces compensatory responses which are currently being intensively studied. Reflex release of atrial natriuretic factor after stimulation of atrial receptors has important physiologic effects in heart failure. The atria, but not the ventricles, are innervated by the vagus; the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulation is often overlooked. The initial increase in heart rate during exercise is primarily due to withdrawal of vagal influence. Besides acetylcholine, the parasympathetic transmitter, many other local hormones may affect cardiac function; these include prostaglandins, 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. Although the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is mediated primarily through beta 1 adrenoceptors, both beta 2 and alpha receptors are also found in the heart. Myocardial alpha 1 receptors, which mediate a positive inotropic effect, have been identified, and prejunctional alpha 2 receptors may mediate inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. 
Quantitative bone and 67Ga scintigraphy in the differentiation of necrotizing external otitis from severe external otitis. Qualitative technetium Tc 99m bone scintigraphy using phosphate compounds and gallium 67 scintigraphy were described as a helpful means in diagnosing necrotizing external otitis (NEO). They were, however, claimed to be nonspecific. Quantitative Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy and gallium 67 scintigraphy were performed in eight patients with NEO and in 20 patients with severe external otitis, in order to prove usefulness of scintigraphy in the diagnosis of NEO. Ratios of lesion to nonlesion for bone scintigraphy were 1.67 +/- 0.16 in patients with NEO and 1.08 +/- 0.09 in patients with severe external otitis, and for gallium 67 scintigraphy they were 1.35 +/- 0.24 in NEO patients and 1.05 +/- 0.03 in patients with severe external otitis. There was no difference in uptake between diabetic patients with severe external otitis and nondiabetic patients. The scintigraphic studies were also evaluated using a qualitative scoring method (scores 0 to +4), according to the intensity of the radiopharmaceutical uptake. This method was found to be inferior in the diagnosis of NEO compared with the quantitative method. We conclude that lesion-to-nonlesion ratios greater than 1.5 and 1.3 on bone and gallium 67 scintigraphy, respectively, are indicative of NEO. Quantitative bone scintigraphy, which is quicker to perform, may be used as a single imaging modality for the diagnosis of NEO. 
Primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle. We report on an unusual case of primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle. Diagnosis was confirmed by light and electron microscopy, as well as specific immunohistochemical staining. This rare tumor is highly aggressive, and refractory to traditional surgical and adjuvant therapeutic modalities. Sarcomatous lesions of the seminal vesicle are reviewed. 
Human T-lymphotropic virus type I screening in volunteer blood donors--United States, 1989. On November 29, 19898, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations to screen all whole blood donations in the United States for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). This report summarizes results of the first 13 months of screening (December 1988 through December 1989) by the American Red Cross (ARC) and the Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC). 
Duodenal ulcer and Sjogren's syndrome in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: a casual association? Peptic ulcer has been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), but its frequency and pathogenesis are still poorly defined. We have analyzed the occurrence of duodenal ulcer in 37 female patients affected by PBC and in 35 with chronic liver disease of various etiologies. An active ulcer was found in seven patients with PBC and in one with chronic autoimmune hepatitis. The presence of an exocrine gland defect, as indicated by clinical signs of Sjogren's syndrome (SS), was found in six patients with PBC and duodenal ulcer (85%), but in only eight (26.6%) of those without ulcer (p less than 0.02). Therefore, in our patients, duodenal ulcer occurs more often in PBC than in other types of chronic liver disease. The association of SS with PBC, significantly higher in patients with than without ulcer, supports the hypothesis that the underlying exocrine gland defect is involved in the development of duodenal ulcer. 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. As clinical experience with patients with ZES has grown, increasing recognition has been made of the broad spectrum of symptoms associated with gastrinomas. Diarrhea and acid-induced esophageal injury have taken their place alongside chronic peptic ulcer disease as indications for screening for gastrinoma. Diagnostic testing should begin with fasting serum gastrin levels and should include intravenous secretin infusion if fasting serum levels of gastrin are nondiagnostic and the patient is not found to be hypochlorhydric. Tumor localization is critical to aid in the identification of patients with potentially curable localized disease. Preoperative evaluation utilizing CT scanning with intravenous contrast should be done early and should be supplemented by other imaging modalities as necessary. Exploratory laparotomy, including a thorough examination of the duodenum and perhaps intraoperative ultrasound, should be performed in all patients with sporadic gastrinoma who lack evidence of extensive metastatic disease on preoperative evaluation. By utilizing this approach, it is likely that at least 20% of patients with ZES can be cured. With the availability of the highly effective H(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole, excellent control of symptoms related to gastric acid hypersecretion can be expected. Patients with unresectable gastrinoma may thus avoid potentially morbid antisecretory surgery and be managed with a fairly simple medical regimen. Further developments in the chemotherapeutic management of these patients with unresectable disease should be forthcoming in the future. 
Left anterior fascicular block: an ischaemic response during treadmill testing. A patient in whom exercise induced reversible ischaemic left anterior fascicular block is reported. Glyceryl trinitrate relieved the fascicular block. Coronary angiography showed a 90% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior fascicular block induced by exercise disappeared after a successful coronary angioplasty. 
Cytomegalovirus appendicitis in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We report a homosexual patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and histopathologic evidence for cytomegalovirus (CMV) appendicitis in a patient with no prior history of CMV infection. The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain and intermittent fevers. The diagnosis of appendicitis was difficult to make in this patient because of the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis ileitis and the frequent presentation of abdominal pain with fever in AIDS patients. Although CMV colitis is frequently seen in AIDS patients, the prevalence of CMV appendicitis is exceedingly rare. The problems related to making a diagnosis of CMV appendicitis and the therapeutic management of CMV infections are reviewed. 
Ten years after cryosurgical treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. From 1974 to 1977 we treated 96 patients for grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with cryotherapy. They were monitored for 10 to 14 years with an attendance rate of 98%. Treatment resulted in cure in 92%. Nine patients had persisting lesions, and three patients had a recurrent lesion. The last recurrence was diagnosed 6.7 years after cryotherapy. 
Use of fluorescent in situ hybridization for marker chromosome identification in congenital and neoplastic disorders. Identifying marker chromosomes of unknown origin in the clinical cytogenetics laboratory has been a problem historically, despite advances in specialized staining techniques. Determination of the origin of these marker chromosomes in patients with congenital or malignant neoplastic disorders is essential for more complete diagnosis, counseling, and treatment. The authors describe the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific alpha-satellite DNA probes to identify the origin of marker chromosomes in two patients with congenital disorders and three patients with malignant neoplastic disorders. The impact of firm identification of the marker chromosome for the diagnosis of these patients is discussed. The authors also discuss the feasibility of using this technique routinely in the clinical cytogenetics laboratory. 
Milrinone, a bridge to heart transplantation. We describe the use of a milrinone infusion as a bridge to heart transplantation in the treatment of severe congestive cardiac failure secondary to viral cardiomyopathy. The clinical improvement that occurred when milrinone was commenced made it possible to wean the patient from conventional cardiovascular support with an intra-aortic balloon pump and dobutamine. There was an improvement in organ perfusion. 
In situ evidence for HPV 16, 18, 33 integration in cervical squamous cell cancer in Britain and South Africa. In a previous study three types of HPV signal were described in CIN. It was suggested that a type 1 signal represented episomal HPV while a type 2 signal represented integrated HPV; and a type 3 signal was indicative of both episomal and integrated HPV. To test this hypothesis 91 squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the cervix from Britain and South Africa were examined for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35. Of the South African group (n = 69) 64% contained HPV types 16 (n = 29) and 18 (n = 15). The SCC in the British group (n = 22) contained HPV 16 and HPV 33 in 12 and three cases, respectively. Of the HPV positive biopsy specimens, 86% showed a type 2 signal in keratinising and non-keratinising tumours and the remainder a type 3 signal. Type 3 signal was present only in keratinising tumours. The presence of punctate signal in 100% of HPV containing SCC, together with localisation of HPV signal to sister chromatids in tumour cell mitotic figures in vivo, provides further evidence for type 2, and the punctate component of type 3 signal representing viral integration. 
Changes in the serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SGOT and myoglobin due to cardiac surgery. Elevation of serum levels of enzymes due to myocardial necrosis is considered to be a specific finding for myocardial infarction. This study was designed to determine the changes in the levels of LDH, SGOT enzymes, LDH1, CK-MB isoenzymes and myoglobin in patients who have had coronary bypass grafting and who have had atriotomy for surgical correction without any evidence of myocardial infarction diagnosed by clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. It was found that CK-MB, LDH, LDH1 and myoglobin showed significant elevations which mimicked a perioperative myocardial infarction. SGOT also increased, but remained within the normal range. CK-MB, LDH and LDH1 increased more in the coronary bypass grafted patients whereas myoglobin increased in the patients who had atriotomies. It was concluded that in order to demonstrate a perioperative myocardial infarction it is necessary to determine at least two of these enzymes for a long period and to correlate these results with the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. 
Unusual presentations of duodenal tuberculosis. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is still rampant in underdeveloped countries and can mimic other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Herein we report four cases of isolated proximal duodenal tuberculosis, without involvement of other parts of the GI tract. The clinical presentation in three of them resembled that of peptic ulcer disease, and one had features of gastric outlet obstruction. On investigation, one of these patients had a pyeloduodenal fistula. The limitations of clinical evaluation, radiology, and endoscopy are stressed, and the value of surgical biopsy is highlighted. 
Antegrade approach to radical retropubic prostatectomy in patients with difficult apical dissection. Among 335 radical retropubic prostatectomies an antegrade dissection was used in 30 because of difficulty in developing the usual planes of dissection during apical dissection. The adequacy of tumor resection, preservation of sexual potency and urinary continence were compared in patients who underwent the antegrade dissection and those who underwent the standard retrograde nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy. Histopathological evaluation revealed no significant difference in the over-all completeness of tumor excision between the group having an antegrade dissection (16 of 30, 53% completely excised) and those having a retrograde dissection (177 of 305, 58% completely excised) (p = 0.62). Patients with clinically localized but pathological stage C disease undergoing an antegrade dissection and a nerve-sparing procedure had a significantly higher incidence of positive lateral margins (9 of 12, 75%) than the comparable group undergoing a retrograde dissection (40 of 99, 40%) (p = 0.02). The incidence of positive apical margins was similar in both groups, with 5 of 14 (36%) of the antegrade stage C cases (36%) having positive apical margins compared to 37 of 117 of the retrograde stage C cases (32%) (p = 0.65). Sexual potency was preserved in 5 of 6 patients (83%) treated with an antegrade dissection who had both neurovascular bundles preserved and were followed for at least 6 months, compared to 86 of 142 (61%) who underwent retrograde dissection (difference not significant, p = 0.26). Potency was preserved in 6 of 13 evaluable patients (46%) undergoing unilateral antegrade nerve-sparing procedure compared to 21 of 48 evaluable patients (44%) undergoing unilateral retrograde nerve-sparing procedure (p = 0.88). Of 22 patients followed for 1 year 21 (95%) have regained urinary continence. We conclude that the antegrade approach to radical retropubic prostatectomy provides results that are comparable to those achieved with the standard retrograde approach but that when an antegrade approach is chosen because of periprostatic fibrosis, bilateral preservation of the neurovascular bundles may result in a higher incidence of positive surgical margins. 
Asthma in the emergency department: impact of a protocol on optimizing therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a simple educational intervention on the prescribing habits of internal medicine residents in the treatment of acute asthma in a busy emergency department (ED). Prescribing habits for 16 residents were documented for 4 months. The first 2 months served as a control period during which eight residents managed asthma patients without the benefit of any specific educational intervention beyond standard department protocols. A total of 129 patients treated by the residents during this initial phase were assessed. During the second 2-month period, a 10-minute verbal presentation and explicit written treatment protocol were provided to another eight residents, and their treatment of 83 patients was covertly evaluated. Increased prescribing of desired therapy was significantly improved in every area except that of prescribing an inhaled steroid metered dose inhaler for use as a discharge medication. The 10-minute verbal presentation given in conjunction with a three-page handout was found to be highly effective for eliciting improvement in treatment practices during short clinical rotations. The duration of this effect beyond each rotation is unknown. This educational intervention should be presented by the ED medical director, clinical pharmacist, or other appropriate clinician in virtually any ED as quality of patient care can be dramatically improved. 
Low peptic ulcer and high gastric cancer prevalence in a developing country with a high prevalence of infection by Helicobacter pylori. We compared the prevalence rates of peptic ulcer (duodenal and gastric) and gastric cancer in 1,796 dyspeptic Peruvian patients with those reported in 2,883 similar patients from developed countries. The prevalence of total peptic ulcer was significantly lower, and that of gastric cancer significantly higher, in the Peruvian patients. The prevalence of gastric ulcer was lower but not significantly so. We deduced that the significantly lower prevalence of total peptic ulcer was directly related to the low prevalence rate of duodenal ulcer. We hypothesize that the reason for these differences was probably a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis with hypochlorhydria in the Peruvian patients. Hypochlorhydria decreases the predisposition to peptic ulcer (especially duodenal ulcer), and chronic atrophic gastritis may predispose an individual to gastric cancer. 
Psychosis following temporal lobe surgery: a report of six cases. Six consecutive patients who had had temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy, and been referred for psychiatric assessment of psychotic symptoms, are reported. Their symptoms (a delusional depression, four schizophrenia-like illnesses, and a case of Capgras' syndrome) are discussed in relation to the possible role of their operations, all of which were on the right hemisphere. 
Quality of life after proctocolectomy. A comparison of Brooke ileostomy, Kock pouch, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Recent work has shown that patients undergoing proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis experience a better quality of life than those undergoing proctocolectomy and Brooke ileostomy. To assess whether the improvement with the pouch is due to the absence of a stoma or the preservation of fecal continence, functional and performance activities were assessed in 406 patients with Brooke ileostomies (stoma present, incontinent), 313 with Kock pouches (stoma present, continent), and 298 with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses (stoma absent, continent). All patients underwent proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. After adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, attitude towards the operation, dietary satisfaction, and ability to work, the likelihood of an impact on performance was estimated for the three types of operation using logistic regression analysis. Patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses had fewer restrictions in sports and sexual activities than those with Kock pouches (P less than 0.05), whereas those with Kock pouches in turn had fewer restrictions in these activities but more restrictions in travel than those with Brooke ileostomies (P less than 0.05). In contrast, performance in the categories of social life, recreation, work, and family was similar between groups. It is concluded that both the presence of a stoma and fecal incontinence impair the quality of life after proctocolectomy. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which avoids both stoma and incontinence, offers the best quality of life between the three operations studied. 
Normal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual "oddball" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe. In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300. 
Optimum dosage of 5-aminosalicylic acid as rectal enemas in patients with active ulcerative colitis. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active moiety of sulphasalazine (SASP), was given as a rectal enema to patients with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis to determine the minimum effective dosage. A double blind study was carried out using enemas containing 1, 2, or 4 g or 5-ASA or placebo for a one month treatment period. One hundred and thirteen patients with ulcerative colitis attending our outpatient clinic volunteered to participate. Clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological assessments were carried out at the beginning of the study and after 15 and 30 days of treatment. All patients who received 5-ASA enemas showed significantly better results than those who received a placebo enema (p less than 0.001) but no difference was detected among the patients receiving differing concentrations of 5-ASA. This study suggests that 1 g 5-ASA (in a 100 ml enema) is a sufficient dosage for patients with a mild to moderate attack of ulcerative colitis. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of transthyretin devised for semimicro plasma diagnosis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. A highly sensitive and reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human transthyretin was developed. The method is most suitable to serial monitoring of transthyretin peaks in reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for the diagnosis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy based on isolation of variant transthyretin. This method semimicronized the original diagnostic method, requiring plasma samples of only 0.2 ml. The present enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method is also applicable to determine transthyretin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It correlated well when compared with a commercially available single radial immunodiffusion (r = 0.951, p less than 0.001). 
Detection of hepatitis B virus pre-S1 and pre-S2 determinants in paraffin wax embedded liver tissue: importance of reagents used. The presence of pre-S polypeptides in paraffin wax embedded liver sections from the biopsy specimens of 15 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive patients (five with chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), four with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), four with cirrhosis and two "healthy" HBsAg carriers) was investigated using monoclonal antibodies directed to distinct epitopes on pre-S1 (18/7 and TO 606) and pre-S2 (5535 and Q 19/10). Pre-S1 was found in 13 cases when MA 18/7 was used but in only one specimen when TO 606 was used. Pre-S2 was detected in all the biopsy specimens with 5535 and in eight samples with Q 19/10. Mild enzymatic digestion annulled the staining of all monoclonal antibodies but Q 19/10. No association was observed between pre-S polypeptide expression and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication or disease severity. Pre-S polypeptides can be detected readily in paraffin wax embedded material but the results obtained largely depend on the monoclonal antibodies used. 
A randomized trial of ofloxacin versus cefoxitin and doxycycline in the outpatient treatment of acute salpingitis. The object of this randomized study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, versus intramuscular cefoxitin, 2 gm, plus oral probenecid, 1 gm, followed by oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 10 days, in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute salpingitis. Thirty-eight women (53%) had Neisseria gonorrhoeae from their pretreatment endocervical or endometrial cultures, and 18 had Chlamydia trachomatis (25%). Thirty-five of 37 women (95%) treated with the ofloxacin regimen were clinically cured, and 34 of 35 (97%) were cured with the cefoxitin-doxycycline regimen (p = 0.52). One clinical failure occurred in each group with N. gonorrhoeae infection, and one failure occurred in the ofloxacin group because of side effects. The bacteriologic response for N. gonorrhoeae in both groups was 100%. The eradication of C. trachomatis was 100% (10/10) for the cefoxitin/doxycycline group and 86% (6/7) for ofloxacin. The side effects were similar in both groups of subjects. In this study both regimens were effective for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute salpingitis. 
Value of dual-energy CT in differentiating focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density masses. Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased. 
Nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension in diabetes mellitus. Hypertension may be partially or completely controlled by appropriate use of nondrug therapies. Because diabetic patients are so often hypertensive and because the same nondrug therapies effective for treatment of hypertension may also benefit the diabetes, the use of nondrug therapies is particularly important in these patients. Evidence about the effectiveness of various nondrug therapies is provided along with practical suggestions to improve patient adherence to them. 
Problems faced by the urban emergency department in providing rapid triage and intervention for the patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Widespread application of thrombolytic therapy has increased the importance of rapid triage and intervention for the patient who seeks treatment in the emergency department (ED) for suspected acute myocardial infarction. It has been suggested that all patients with acute myocardial infarction who might benefit from thrombolytic therapy should receive treatment within the first "golden hour" of arrival at the hospital ED. Busy urban medical centers, particularly public hospitals serving a large proportion of indigent patients, face special challenges in attempting to meet this goal. ED overcrowding, in part caused by patient "dumping," and diminishing governmental financial support have created an environment in which rapid triage and treatment are difficult. Because only 4% to 5% of all patients who are seen in the ED with chest pain actually require thrombolytic therapy, there is negative reinforcement for the triage nursing staff. The busy urban ED environment also creates greater litigation potential for the physician and nurse. Problems created by the busy ED environment can be minimized by providing adequate nursing staff, standing orders and protocols for evaluation of the patient with chest pain, equipment for an immediate electrocardiogram, and a thrombolytic drug stock in the ED. Hospital administrators must recognize the unique problems created in the ED when inpatient beds are unavailable. The hospital must also have efficient bed turnover and a community-wide plan for dealing with patients when the ED "closes" to incoming ambulance traffic. Governmental entities must recognize the consequences of their actions in curtailing health care benefits for those who cannot afford care in private hospitals. 
Reactivity of proximal and distal angiographically normal and stenotic coronary segments in chronic stable angina pectoris. To assess whether vasoreactivity of significant coronary stenosis (greater than 50% intraluminal diameter reduction) and that of angiographically normal coronary segments differs in proximal and distal locations, 53 patients (40 men, 13 women, mean +/- standard deviation age 55 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease were studied. While abstaining from antianginal therapy, all 53 patients underwent coronary arteriography before and after 1 mg of intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and 21 of the 53 also before and after 20 to 30 micrograms intracoronary ergonovine. Computerized quantitative angiography was used to assess changes in the intraluminal diameter of 126 normal coronary segments (63 proximal, 63 distal) and 43 significant coronary stenoses. Nitrates dilated proximal normal coronary segments by 7.4 +/- 1.2% and distal normal coronary segments by 15 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.01). Significant proximal coronary stenoses dilated by 11 +/- 2.5% and distal stenoses by 23 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.01) after nitrates. Ergonovine reduced the diameter of proximal normal coronary segments by 9.3 +/- 1.7% and that of normal distal segments by 15.5 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.01). Proximal stenoses constricted by 11 +/- 2.2% and distal stenoses by 18.4 +/- 2.8% (p = 0.06). Analysis of segments showed that nitrates dilated 19 of 63 (30%) proximal normal segments by (greater than or equal to 10%), 31 of 63 (49%) distal (p less than 0.05) and 21 of 43 (49%) stenoses. 
Subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil and herpes simplex keratitis. We present a case of herpes simplex keratitis that appeared during a period following filtering surgery in which subconjunctival 5-FU was being administered. Although the 5-FU treatment was not halted, 4 days later the keratitis healed. The typical practice of discontinuing 5-FU treatment when these kinds of inflammation occur following filtering surgery may be unwarranted. 
Murine typhus identified as a major cause of febrile illness in a camp for displaced Khmers in Thailand. Scrub and murine typhus have been identified as causes of illness among the 238,000 displaced Khmer people residing in temporary settlements on the Thai side of the Thai-Cambodian border. Still, the true extent of the problem and the relative frequency of infection with scrub typhus as compared to murine typhus are unknown. We evaluated consecutive patients with unexplained pyrexia (documented fever, no exclusionary diagnosis, and constitutional symptoms) in 1 temporary settlement over 1 month. Laboratory studies included culture of blood and assay of paired sera for rickettsial IgM and IgG antibody, for dengue IgM and IgG antibody, and for leptospiral IgM and IgG antibody. Among 37 patients (27 adults and 10 children), 28 (75%) had a rickettsiosis (26 cases of murine typhus and 2 cases of scrub typhus). No case of enteric fever, dengue, or leptospirosis was diagnosed. The illnesses of 9 patients were not identified. Signs and symptoms did not distinguish confirmed rickettsial infections from undiagnosed illnesses. The 1 month attack rate of rickettsial infection was 29/100,000 for children and 185/100,000 for adults. Murine typhus was a major cause of febrile illness in this settlement. 
The Washington University-Barnes Hospital experience with lung transplantation. Washington University Lung Transplantation Group OBJECTIVE.--To review our experience with lung transplantation, emphasizing recipient selection, choice of procedure, functional results, and outcome. DESIGN.--Retrospective review of patients who received lung transplants at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Mo, between July 1, 1988, and January 31, 1991. SETTING.--Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo, and Barnes Hospital, a medical school and its affiliated referral hospital, respectively. PATIENTS.--Sixty-nine lung transplant procedures were performed in 66 recipients. Patients with clinically and physiologically severe lung disease were selected according to predetermined guidelines. Underlying diseases in the recipients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome associated with an atrial septal defect, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangiomyomatosis. INTERVENTION.--Double-lung, bilateral sequential, and single-lung transplantations were performed. Eight patients underwent en bloc double-lung transplantations or a modification of this procedure with separate bronchial anastomoses. Thereafter, the bilateral sequential approach to replacement of both lungs was performed in 26 patients. Thirty-two patients underwent single-lung transplantations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas levels, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and actuarial survival. RESULTS.--Actuarial survival at 1 year for the 66 lung transplant recipients was 79%. Actuarial survival at 1 year was 82% for the bilateral lung transplant recipients and was 90% for the single-lung transplant recipients. In patients with either restrictive or obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels improved markedly after lung transplantation. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome, the pulmonary artery pressure decreased and the cardiac index increased into the normal range after single-lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS.--In carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease, single-lung and bilateral lung transplantations can significantly improve functional capacity, with promising early actuarial survival statistics after 1 year. 
Migraine pain associated with middle cerebral artery dilatation: reversal by sumatriptan. The combination of measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood velocity in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) by transcranial doppler sonography was used to investigate cerebrovascular involvement in migraine. Ten migraine patients with unilateral headache were studied during an attack and when they had been free of attacks for 5 days (non-attack). On both occasions they were given as intravenous infusion of sumatriptan (2 mg), a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, which relieved the symptoms within 30 min without affecting rCBF. The MCA velocity was normal on both sides on the non-attack day and on the unaffected side during the attack. However, during the attack the MCA velocity on the headache side was significantly lower than that on the non-headache side (45 vs 61 cm/s:mean difference 16.3 [95% confidence interval 10.3-22.3]; p = 0.02). The MCA velocity on the headache side returned to normal after treatment with sumatriptan and recovery. Since rCBF in the MCA supply territory was unaffected, the lower velocity can be explained only by dilatation of the MCA. The mean MCA diameter increase was estimated to be 20%. Thus, headache was associated with intracranial large arterial dilatation on the headache side. Sumatriptan predominantly had effects on the distended artery, which suggests that the 5-HT receptor system has a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. 
Beta-adrenergic blocker therapy does not worsen intermittent claudication in subjects with peripheral arterial disease. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Beta-Adrenergic blockers have been considered relatively contraindicated in peripheral arterial disease because of the perceived risk that these drugs could worsen intermittent claudication. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials from the English-language literature to determine whether or not beta-blockers exacerbate intermittent claudication. The primary focus of this analysis was the effect of beta-blockers on exercise duration, measured as walking capacity or endurance time. Outcomes were pooled where appropriate. Of 11 eligible reports, six included 11 individual controlled treatment comparisons that provided data for an analysis of pain-free exercise capacity; no effect size was statistically significant. The pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance was -0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.62 to 0.14), indicating no significant impairment of walking capacity compared with placebo. Only one study reported that certain beta-blockers were associated with worsening of intermittent claudication. These results strongly suggest that beta-blockers do not adversely affect walking capacity or symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. In the absence of other contraindications, beta-blockers can probably be used safely in such patients. 
Exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease with and without angina. Left ventricular dysfunction during exercise is considered a relatively sensitive marker of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction was more severe in patients with angina than in patients with ischemia without angina. Seventy-seven patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and an abnormal left ventricular response to exercise were studied by means of gated blood pool imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing were compared with those of 53 patients who were pain free at the time of the test. Both groups were similar with regard to rate of multivessel disease (50% vs 51%, p = NS) and prior myocardial infarction (46% vs 51%, p = NS), as well as age, sex, and history of angina. Mean global ejection fraction remained unchanged (but abnormal) in both groups of patients during exercise. Furthermore, evidence of new regional asynergy during exercise assessed by a five-point scoring system was found to be equally abnormal in the two groups. Results of this study suggest that the severity of exercise-induced global and regional left ventricular dysfunction is independent of the presence of absence of angina during exercise testing. 
Laser balloon angioplasty: potential for reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and for local application of bioprotective materials. Mitigation of adverse biologic reactivity after balloon angioplasty is necessary before the incidence of restenosis can be appreciably reduced. A brief review of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall can be reduced by a suitable level of thermal denaturation or cross-linking of thrombogenic proteins. In addition, the concept of local pharmacologic therapy, which can be provided with laser balloon angioplasty at the site of arterial injury, is introduced. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data suggest that guide catheter-injected albumin-heparin conjugates fabricated as water-insoluble microspheres remain adherent to the injured luminal surface and deeper arterial layers after physical trapping by the inflated balloon and subsequent laser/thermal exposure. The combination of initially adequate luminal morphology, reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and application of local pharmacologic therapy with laser balloon angioplasty may eventually prove helpful in reducing the incidence of restenosis. 
Leber congenital amaurosis in siblings with diffuse dysmyelination. Two brothers are described with the previously unrecognized combination of Leber amaurosis and abnormal myelin detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Both have evidence of delayed psychomotor development and one has autistic features. A possible relationship with infantile autism or a peroxisomal dysfunction syndrome is explored. No peroxisomal defect was found in these patients. 
The effect of carbon dioxide laser surgery on the recurrence of keloids. The efficacy of carbon dioxide laser excision as a primary modality for the treatment of keloids was evaluated. This retrospective study focuses on 31 patients with one or more keloids, 23 of whom were available for follow-up after carbon dioxide laser excision. The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 72 years. There were 16 females and 7 males. One patient was Caucasian, 22 patients were non-Caucasian, and there were no Asians. The keloids that were excised ranged in size from 1 to 30 cm in greatest diameter. One patient had no recurrence of her keloid after carbon dioxide laser excision, 9 patients required steroids to suppress recurrences, and 13 patients were considered failures. Reasons for the failure of this modality, as well as speculation regarding the future of this procedure, are discussed. 
The comparison of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose and 15-(ortho-123I-phenyl)-pentadecanoic acid uptake in persisting defects on thallium-201 tomography in myocardial infarction. The myocardial uptake of glucose and fatty acids into 201Tl redistribution defects were studied in 32 patients with myocardial infarction by tomography using 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and 15-(ortho-123I-phenyl)-pentadecanoic acid (oPPA). A total of 1153 segments were analyzed, 408 (35%) of which showed a persistent thallium-defect in stress-redistribution images. Of the segments with a decreased 201Tl uptake in these redistribution tomograms, 50.5% had a decreased uptake of both FDG and oPPA; in 21.8% FDG as well as oPPA uptake was within normal range. Normal FDG uptake but decreased oPPA uptake was detected in 17.4%, whereas 10.3% of the segments had normal oPPA uptake but decreased FDG uptake (chi-square test, p less than 0.001). A significant correlation of FDG and oPPA uptake (r = 0.51) was found in the segments with persistent 201Tl defect. Thus, a substantial fraction of persistent thallium-defects after healed myocardial infarction exhibit FDG as well as oPPA uptake, probably due to residual fatty acid metabolism in partially ischemic regions. 
Carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in dogs with experimental heart failure. We have previously demonstrated a decrease in baroreceptor discharge sensitivity in dogs with experimental heart failure. In the present study, we determined the sensitivity of the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure. The carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was determined by pressurizing one carotid sinus with all other baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor inputs removed. The data were analyzed by plotting carotid sinus pressure-mean arterial pressure curves and carotid sinus pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity curves in the two groups of dogs. The peak arterial pressure during carotid hypotension was significantly depressed in dogs with heart failure compared with normal dogs (107.1 +/- 5.7 versus 139.8 +/- 7.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial pressure range, renal sympathetic nerve activity range, and peak slope were significantly decreased in the heart-failure group. To determine if this depression was completely due to depression of baroreceptor discharge per se, or to alterations in central or end-organ responsiveness, similar experiments were performed by stimulating the carotid sinus nerve and evaluating frequency, voltage, and duration of stimulation on the resultant mean arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity. As was the case with carotid sinus pressurization, electrical stimulation caused a significantly smaller change in mean arterial pressure in heart-failure dogs compared with the normal dogs. However, there was no significant difference between normal and heart-failure dogs for the renal sympathetic nerve activity-electrical stimulation curves. These data strongly suggest that the depressed carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in heart failure is not solely the result of depressed baroreceptor responsiveness but may be related to poor end-organ responses and normal central control of renal sympathetic outflow. 
Therapeutic approach to sinusitis: antiinfectious therapy as the baseline of management. Although acute sinusitis is an infectious disease in which several bacterial species play a major etiologic role, there is an important interaction between the respiratory viruses (common cold viruses) and the bacteria in the pathogenesis of acute community-acquired sinusitis. The relative inaccessibility of the sinus cavities makes special techniques of sampling necessary to acquire specimens that accurately reflect disease conditions in the sinuses. Bacterial etiology of sinus infection has therefore been determined by sinus puncture studies, chiefly of the maxillary sinus, several of which are reviewed here. Because the bacteria causing acute sinusitis have not changed in many years, puncture is not often necessary for clinical diagnosis. Patients with acute, community-acquired sinusitis can usually be treated empirically, on the basis of previous studies, unless complications are suspected. In that case, and in other patients with hospital-acquired sinusitis, puncture of the involved sinus and aspiration of sinus fluid for Gram's staining and quantitative microbial cultures and sensitivities are required for appropriate antimicrobial management. 
Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation (CAFA) Study. The Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential of warfarin to reduce systemic thromboembolism and its inherent risk of hemorrhage. As a result of the publication of two other "positive" studies of similar design and objective, this study was stopped early before completion of its planned recruitment of 630 patients. There were 187 patients randomized to warfarin and 191 to placebo. Permanent discontinuation of study medication occurred in 26% of warfarin-treated and 23% of placebo-treated patients. The target range of the international normalized ratio was 2 to 3. For the warfarin-treated patients, the international normalized ratio was in the target range 43.7% of the study days, above it 16.6% of the study days and below it 39.6% of the study days. Fatal or major bleeding occurred at annual rates of 2.5% in warfarin-treated and 0.5% in placebo-treated patients. Minor bleeding occurred in 16% of patients receiving warfarin and 9% receiving placebo. The primary outcome event cluster was nonlacunar stroke, noncentral nervous systemic embolism and fatal or intracranial hemorrhage. Events were included in the primary analysis of efficacy if they occurred within 28 days of permanent discontinuation of the study medication. The annual rates of the primary outcome event cluster were 3.5% in warfarin-treated and 5.2% in placebo-treated patients, with a relative risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence limits, -63.5%, 75.5%, p = 0.17). 
Comparative reflex response times of vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis in normal subjects and subjects with extensor mechanism dysfunction. An electromyographic study. Reflex response times of the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis were evaluated in 41 normal subjects and 16 patients with extensor mechanism dysfunction. The reflex response times for both muscles to a patellar tendon tap were evaluated by electromyography. The latencies of the muscles were statistically analyzed in both groups. In normal subjects, one-tailed paired-sample t-tests determined that the vastus medialis obliquus fired significantly faster than the vastus lateralis (P less than 0.001). In the patients, the vastus lateralis fired significantly faster than the vastus medialis obliquus (P less than 0.001). A chi square goodness of fit test demonstrated a dependency between the order of muscle firing and the type of subject (P less than 0.001). Two-tailed independent-sample t-tests revealed that the patients demonstrated a significantly faster vastus lateralis response time than the normal subjects (P less than 0.001), whereas the vastus medialis obliquus times were not significantly different. This increase in vastus lateralis reflex response time may indicate a motor control problem in the patient with extensor mechanism dysfunction. Results indicate that there is a reversal of the normal muscular firing order between the two muscles in these patients. Patients with extensor mechanism dysfunction may be demonstrating a neurophysiologic motor control imbalance that may account for or contribute to their anterior knee pain. 
Unsuspected quinine intoxication presenting as acute deafness and mutism. A case of unsuspected quinine overdose is reported in a 14-year-old girl. Presenting symptoms included deafness and mutism. Diagnosis was delayed for approximately 4 hours because of the absence of an accurate history. Case details, laboratory values, and hospital course are discussed. Signs of cinchonism and common ototoxins are discussed. Strategies for the management of quinine overdose are reviewed. 
Unilateral pulmonary oedema of the contralateral lung following transaxillary sympathectomy. A previously healthy young male developed unilateral pulmonary oedema immediately after re-expansion of an intentionally collapsed lung after transaxillary sympathectomy. The pulmonary oedema was localised to the contralateral, uncollapsed lung. 
Primary surgical treatment for carcinoma of the larynx: influence of the local invasion. In the period from 1976 to 1988, 417 patients with supraglottic carcinoma of the larynx were treated by primary surgery. Infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space was found in 11.99 per cent (50/417) of the patients. Carcinomas of the infrahyoid epiglottis spread to this space more frequently--14.24 per cent (44/309), than those of suprahyoid localization--5.55 per cent (6/108). Tumour invasion of the pre-epiglottic space is a relative contra-indication for reconstructive surgery. Partial conservation operations were performed on 32 per cent (16/50) of patients with invasion of the pre-epiglottic space. The remaining patients had a total laryngectomy. Infiltration of the paraglottic space intra-operatively was found in 2.4 per cent (10/417) of patients and all of these tumours were from the infrahyoid localization. Spread of tumours to this site is an indication for radical surgery and laryngectomy was performed on 80 per cent (8/10) of patients. 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A new look at regression of gastrinomas. Of 44 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated at our institution, nine appeared to have undergone "regression" of their gastrinomas. Six of the nine patients had sporadic gastrinomas and became permanently eugastrinemic following excision of nodal metastases and total gastrectomy (n = 4), antrectomy (n = 1), or pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 1) (mean survival, 13 years). The other three patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the multiple endocrine adenopathy type 1 syndrome and became temporarily eugastrinemic after total gastrectomy (mean survival, 11 years). Occult submucosal duodenal-wall microgastrinomas (mean size, 3.0 mm) were found to have been serendipitously excised in four patients. Long-term follow-up of these nine patients, as well as of six other patients described in the literature, demonstrates that excision of occult duodenal-wall gastrinomas provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of apparent regression of primary gastrinomas and the eugastrinemia that may follow total gastrectomy. 
Spontaneous dissecting aneurysms of the basilar artery presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Report of two cases. A spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the basilar artery is a rare disorder, usually presenting with ischemia rather than a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Two cases are described of a dissecting aneurysm of the basilar artery presenting with an SAH. Vertebral angiography revealed a double lumen to the basilar artery. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging detected the intramural hematoma. One patient was treated conservatively, and the other underwent operative intervention with wrapping of the aneurysm. The usefulness of MR imaging in the diagnosis and the treatment options are discussed. 
Reversible sustained increase of gastrin and gastric acid secretion in a subgroup of duodenal ulcer patients on long-term treatment with H2 antagonists We assessed the effect of long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion on basal and meal-stimulated serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion in 37 patients on long-term maintenance treatment with H2 antagonists for severe relapsing and/or complicated duodenal ulcer disease. After a mean of 142 weeks (range, 28-324 weeks) of continuous treatment, gastric acid secretion, basal plasma gastrin, and gastrin response to a test meal were evaluated. All tests were performed a week after drug discontinuation to exclude rapidly reversible hypergastrinemia. Gastrin levels were above the normal range in seven patients (18.9%). After H2 antagonist were stopped for 6 weeks, basal gastrin returned to normal levels in all cases [from a median of 180 (range, 130-350) pg/ml to 58 (25-90) pg/ml] and peak meal-stimulated gastrin significantly decreased from a median of 500 pg/ml to 245 pg/ml (p = 0.02). In patients with hypergastrinemia, the discontinuation of H2 antagonists for 6 weeks led to a significant decrease of gastric acid secretion. Patients who developed hypergastrinemia spent more weeks on full-dose treatment and had more recurrences during therapy. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion can induce, in a small percentage of patients, a reversible sustained hypergastrinemia and a consequent increase of acid secretion, which conceivably could lead to more frequent relapses of duodenal ulcer disease. 
Molecular differences between human and experimental pancreaticobiliary diversion-induced rat pancreatic neoplasia. A series of molecular changes are now known to be seen in human pancreatic neoplasia, including the very frequent mutational activation of Kirsten ras oncogene at codon 12, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and abnormalities of c-erbB-2 expression. In order to determine whether similar changes can be seen in animal models of pancreatic cancer a molecular analysis of tumours induced in rats by pancreaticobiliary diversion was performed. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify portions of the rat Kirsten ras gene and sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridisation was used to define whether sequences were wild type or mutant. No evidence of mutation was found in the Kirsten ras gene at codons 12 or 61, where activating mutations are known to occur. In addition immunohistochemical methods were used to investigate expression of c-erB-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor but no evidence of abnormal expression was found. We conclude that there are major molecular differences between human and experimental rat pancreatic cancer. 
Nd:YAG iliac and femoropopliteal laser angioplasty: results with large probes as "sole therapy". Laser assisted balloon angioplasty with a laser heated metallic capped fiberoptic catheter may be effective in the treatment of femoral and iliac artery occlusive disease. In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time "debulk" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as "sole therapy". Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts). Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage. The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries. In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent. When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively. By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as "sole therapy" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis due to Xylohypha bantiana. We encountered a rare case of pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis due to Xylohypha bantiana documented by culture. This dematiaceous (darkly pigmented) fungus is primarily neurotropic. It usually produces phaeohyphomycosis of the central nervous system but may also involve the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The patient, a 49-year-old woman with a history of steroid-treated inflammatory bowel disease, was found to have a lung nodule consisting of granulomas that contained dark hyphal fragments that stained positively with the argentaffin reaction. Surgical excision was curative and appears to be the treatment of choice. 
Angiographic evolution of coronary atherosclerosis in patients receiving propranolol. A two-year follow-up STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test whether propranolol may influence the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. DESIGN: Repeat coronary angiography after two year treatment and evaluation of changes in coronary narrowings. SETTING: Subjects with effort angina of recent onset requiring coronary angiography and medical treatment. PATIENTS: 80 untreated patients, with a greater than or equal to 50 percent focal narrowing on a major coronary branch associated or not with a less than 50 percent stenosis of other major branches. They were randomized to isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg bid) (group 1, control group) or to propranolol (80 mg qid) (group 2, treatment group). RESULTS: At restudy, there were more diseased vessels and These narrowings per patient in both groups. Multivessel involvement and greater than or equal to 50 percent obstructions were also augmented. These changes were not statistically significant. Patients with progression of the stenotic tracts (both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent were 19 (48 percent) in group 1 and 28 (70 percent) in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Narrowings with progression were 25 in group 1 and 48 in group 2. Thirteen narrowings in group 1 and 15 in group 2 were newly detected at restudy. Eighteen patients (45 percent) in group 1 and nine (23 percent) in group 2 had a steady disease. Smoking, high blood pressure, family history of coronary disease, blood glucose values and lipid levels were considered; the only significant group differences were 31 percent rise of total triglyceride and 23 percent decrease of HDL cholesterol in patients who were treated with propranolol. CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol showed an adverse influence on coronary atherosclerosis, regarding the evolution of both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent narrowings and not the formation of new stenoses. Changes in serum lipid values might have a role. 
Comparison of duplex ultrasonography and venography in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Sixty-five patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 68 limbs were entered consecutively into a study to compare venography with duplex ultrasonography scanning. Both tests were performed on 64 limbs, venography being contraindicated in four. Overall, duplex scanning correctly identified 86 per cent of DVTs diagnosed on venography and correctly excluded 80 per cent with negative venograms. Nearly all errors arose in the diagnosis of calf DVT. In the femoral vein duplex scanning had a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 95 per cent. In addition, duplex scanning provided data on the limb not undergoing venography. Of 55 limbs that underwent bilateral duplex scanning, five had thrombus in the femoropopliteal segment and a negative contralateral venogram. In addition, three Baker's cysts were diagnosed. Duplex scanning can be used in patients in whom venography is contraindicated and may also provide information about the contralateral limb. We regard femoropopliteal duplex scanning as sufficiently accurate that treatment can be initiated on the basis of the scan. Duplex scanning should replace venography as the standard method of diagnosing femoropopliteal DVT; radiographic studies should now be required only when the scan result is in doubt. 
Use of amiodarone for short-term and adjuvant therapy in young patients. Limited data are available defining the safety of amiodarone for short-term use or as part of combination antiarrhythmic therapy in pediatric patients. Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances. 
Gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with AIDS. To clarify the prevalence and characteristics of gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with AIDS, we reviewed the demographics and clinical features of patients with AIDS and gastrointestinal neoplasms seen at North Central Bronx Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center during the past 8 yr. Malignant neoplasia complicated AIDS in 108/869 (12%) of the cases in our study. Most common was Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) (60%), followed by lymphoma (35%) and miscellaneous tumors (6.5%). The gastrointestinal tract was involved in 35/108 (32%) of patients with AIDS and neoplasia. Gastrointestinal tract involvement with KS usually was silent, although present, in every patient with KS who underwent autopsy. Lymphoma was most commonly non-Hodgkin's, and often produced symptoms. Uncommonly, the gastrointestinal tract was the primary site of neoplasms other than KS or lymphoma. 
Frontal lobe degeneration: clinical, neuropsychological, and SPECT characteristics. The clinical, neuropsychological, and cerebral blood flow characteristics of eight patients with frontal lobe degeneration (FLD) were studied. Social withdrawal and behavioral disinhibition were the earliest and most common clinical presentations, and psychiatric symptoms typically preceded the onset of dementia by several years. Neuropsychological testing showed selective impairment of frontal and memory tasks with relative sparing of attention, language, and visuospatial skills. Single-photon emission computerized tomography demonstrated frontal and temporal hypoperfusion with relative sparing of parietal and occipital blood flow. Previous studies suggest that the neuropathologic findings in patients with FLD are varied; some demonstrate frontal gliosis, neuronal loss, and Pick bodies while others show only gliosis and neuronal loss. 
Physician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk hospital patients. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review. SETTING: A community-wide study in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts. PATIENTS: A total of 2017 patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of age, length of hospitalization, and the presence of at least one additional major risk factor, 17% of 151,349 discharges (25,410 patients) were identified as being at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Eight percent of these discharges were randomly selected for medical record review. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was received by 32% of these high-risk patients. Prophylaxis use among the 16 study hospitals varied widely, ranging from 9% to 56%, and was higher in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals (44% compared with 19%; P less than 0.001). One or more of the following methods of prophylaxis was used: low-dose heparin (78%), intermittent calf compression (13%), warfarin (12%), and inferior vena caval filter (3%). Use of prophylaxis increased with the number of risk factors identified (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis for venous thromboemobolism is underused, particularly in nonteaching hospitals. 
Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease among U.S. military veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs maintains a computerized patient treatment file that contains all records from veterans treated as inpatients in VA hospitals distributed throughout the United States. Using the patient treatment files from 1986 to 1989, the present study takes advantage of this large national data set to examine demographic and geographic associations of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease tended to affect predominantly female, white, and younger veterans, these trends being more marked in cases of Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. Hospital discharges secondary to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in veterans from northern than southern parts of the United States, but did not show a seasonal variation different from the general pattern of all other diagnoses. The results in veterans confirm observations made in other studies and suggest that inflammatory bowel disease among different populations is modulated by similar pathophysiologic mechanisms and environmental risk factors. 
Barrett's esophagus. A continuing conundrum. Barrett's esophagus, a condition in which the distal esophagus is lined by columnar epithelium, is almost always caused by gastroesophageal reflux and often occurs in conjunction with a sliding hiatal hernia. Patients are typically white men in their 50s who smoke and drink, and they present with complaints of regurgitation, heartburn, and/or dysphagia. Endoscopic biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Complications, such as stricture, ulcer, dysplasia, and malignant degeneration, occur in many cases. Adenocarcinoma is the most serious complication. Medical treatment, including life-style changes as well as pharmacologic therapy, usually relieves symptoms and heals esophagitis, but when it fails, antireflux surgery is indicated. Patients without evidence of dysplasia should undergo endoscopy yearly; those with mild dysplasia require more frequent surveillance. If biopsies disclose severe dysplasia, esophagogastrectomy should be performed. 
Reading problems in adult chronic headache sufferers. In a questionnaire survey we determined the prevalence of problems with reading, at present as well as in the past, in adult chronic headache sufferers as compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The reading problems inquired about were those with reading in general, reading quickly, prolonged reading and reading comprehension. The subjects were also asked about present and past problems with writing, concentrating, performing mathematics and overall learning. Significant differences in the prevalences of the problems studied between the headache sufferers and controls were observed on just two items and only for the female groups. These items were present problems with reading comprehension (39.3% versus 7.5%; p = 0.002) and concentrating (46.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.015). We concluded that adult female headache sufferers have impaired reading comprehension and concentration abilities which do not seem to originate from the past. 
Structure-function relationships of the mouse inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The homotetrameric complex of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptors displays a Ca2+ release activity in response to InsP3 molecules. Structure-function relationships of the mouse cerebellar InsP3 receptor have been studied by analyses of a series of internal deletion or C-terminal truncation mutant proteins expressed in NG108-15 cells. Within the large cytoplasmic portion of the InsP3 receptor, approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila, and this region has the critical sequences for InsP3 binding that probably form the three-dimensionally restricted binding site. The N-terminal region of each InsP3 receptor subunit also binds one InsP3 molecule. Cross-linking experiments have revealed that InsP3 receptors are intermolecularly associated at the transmembrane domains and/or the successive C termini. The interaction between the receptor subunit and InsP3 may cause a conformational change in the tetrameric complex, resulting in the opening of Ca2+ channels. 
Treatment of pathologic fracture of the humerus. Twenty-one patients with 22 pathologic humeral fractures were seen between January 1977 and November 1988. All fractures were secondary to myeloma or metastatic disease. Primary bone tumors were not included. Nineteen of 22 fractures were treated with intramedullary fixation: 12 of these fractures were also treated with methylmethacrylate. Two patients had compression plating, and the remaining patient had no surgery. Twenty-eight percent had a previously undiagnosed malignancy. Postoperatively, 78% of the patients had only mild or moderate pain. Five patients had progression of local disease postoperatively, two resulting in failure of fixation. Both plates failed. Three patients required additional humeral procedures, one of which was a shoulder disarticulation for pain. Intramedullary fixation of pathologic fractures improves the quality of life by controlling pain for most patients. Complications, treatment failures, and pain are related to a 29% rate of tumor progression and a 23% rate of fixation failure. 
Preeclampsia, trisomy 13, and the placental bed. Genetic predisposition and abnormal trophoblastic function are thought to contribute to the development of preeclampsia. A multipara developed severe preeclampsia and subsequently delivered a live growth-retarded infant with trisomy 13. Biopsy of the placental bed taken immediately after delivery demonstrated inadequate trophoblastic remodeling of the maternal uterine vasculature, with an absence of normal physiologic changes in the spiral arteries. This case suggests that fetal trisomy 13 can be associated with preeclampsia in multiparous women and that abnormal trophoblastic invasion may contribute to the pathophysiology. 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to assess the side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate in hormone replacement therapy. Cyclic progestin therapy has been widely advocated as an adjunct to postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy to reduce the risk of endometrial carcinoma. Acceptance of this approach, however, appears to have preceded detailed evaluation of possible adverse side effects of progestins that could result in patient noncompliance. We evaluated the nonmenstrual physical and psychological side effects of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate given in conjunction with transdermal estrogen in two groups of women with previous hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Twenty-four women with prospectively documented severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before surgery and 24 women with no such history of adverse premenstrual changes received transdermal estrogen 100 micrograms on days 1-25 and either oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily or an identical placebo (days 12-25) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Mood and physical symptoms were monitored prospectively, using daily self-ratings on the Daily Symptoms Checklist. The Beck Depression Inventory and Premenstrual Tension Self-Rating Scale were completed on day 24. At the study's completion, the patients were asked which treatment period they preferred. Paired comparisons did not reveal any significant differences, and preference for treatment was equally divided between medroxyprogesterone acetate and placebo. We conclude that addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 14 days to cyclic transdermal estrogen therapy (days 1-25) produces no consistent adverse physical or psychological effects on women for one cycle of treatment, regardless of their PMS history. 
A randomized trial comparing radiation therapy versus concomitant radiation therapy and chemotherapy in carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus. From September 1982 to December 1985, 59 previously untreated patients with Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were randomly assigned to receive radiation therapy (RT) alone versus the concomitant use of RT and chemotherapy (CT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C, and bleomycin (RT + CT). Thirty-one patients were randomized to the RT regimen and 28 to the RT + CT regimen. The complete local response rate was 58% for the RT group and 75% for the RT + CT group (P = 0.77). The median duration of response was 8 months for both groups. The overall 5-year survival rates were 6% and 16% (P = 0.16) for the RT and RT + CT groups, respectively. Acute toxicities were more pronounced in the RT + CT group. This clinical trial did not detect a difference in outcome with combined-technique therapy. This result must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of patients entered in this trial. Confirmation of the value or lack of value for combined therapy will require additional larger clinical trials. 
Characterization of in vitro chemosensitivity of perioperative human ovarian malignancies by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay. We report the in vitro chemosensitivity of primary and recurrent human ovarian tumor samples analyzed by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay. We defined sensitivity as a greater than or equal to 70% decrease in intracellular adenosine triphosphate versus control at 20% of the reported peak plasma concentration per agent tested. Twenty of 21 assays (95.24%) were completed successfully. Single-agent and combined dose-response patterns consisting of decreasing viability with increasing drug concentration were observed consistently. Thirteen primary tumors were assayed, with 15.4% sensitive to cisplatin, 7.7% sensitive to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and 53.8% sensitive to their combination. Seven recurrent tumors were assayed, with 14.3% sensitive to cisplatin, 28.6% sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, and 42.9% sensitive to their combination. Dose-response characteristics and in vitro sensitivity rates reported in this article are consistent with reports of patient response in the literature. We conclude that adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay is an efficient and reliable instrument for the in vitro chemosensitivity assessment of human tumors and warrants further clinical investigation. 
The abdomen, thigh, and arm as sites for subcutaneous sodium heparin injections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three subcutaneous injection sites for low-dose heparin therapy (5,000 units). One hundred and one subjects were randomly placed in one of three groups. Group A received injections in the abdomen, Group B, in the thigh, and Group C in the arm. Each subject received three injections at the one site. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured prior to initiation of heparin and again four hours after the first injection. Bruising was measured at 48, 60, and 72 hours postinjection. There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either changes in APTT or bruising at 60 and 72 hours postinjection. Thus the clinical practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported. 
Open surgery assisted by the neuronavigator, a stereotactic, articulated, sensitive arm. A new computed tomographic-stereotactic device that translates the operating point onto preoperative computed tomographic (CT) images, the Neuronavigator, has been developed. We have applied this system to various neurosurgical procedures to examine its usefulness. The system consists of a 6-joint sensing arm and a 16-bit personal computer. It projects the location of the arm tip onto a corresponding CT slice with a cursor that guides the surgeon toward the intracranial target during open surgery. The system also projects the location of the tip onto angiograms, and when used in conjunction with echography or a transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow meter, the surgeon's ability to navigate is enhanced. Sixty-eight patients underwent operation with the Neuronavigator. The navigation system worked as the core of a multimodal three-dimensional data base that proved to be useful during surgery. The maximum detection error was 2.5 mm, which was considered sufficient for open microsurgery. It also proved useful in designing the position of a craniotomy, in targeting deep-seated mass lesions, and in tracing the tumor edge, which had been identified on a CT scan. When the angiogram was combined with the navigator, it became easy to identify key vessels within a small operating field. The system was also combined with a TCD flow meter. This combination makes it possible to translate the measuring point of the TCD directly into CT coordinates, improving the precision of location of the TCD probe. The Neuronavigator combines various diagnostic images into one database and effectively guides the surgeon during surgery. 
Can anxiety help us tolerate pain? It was hypothesized that anxiety which is relevant to the source of pain exacerbates pain, whereas anxiety which is irrelevant to the source of pain reduces the experience of pain. Female subjects were given either high or low anxiety provoking information about a cold pressor task (relevant anxiety) or high or low anxiety provoking information about a potential shock (irrelevant anxiety). Subjects were then exposed to the cold pressor. The results demonstrated that subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor reported experiencing the most pain. Subjects who were highly anxious about the shock reported the least pain and reported significantly less pain than subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor. These findings clearly demonstrate that the relationship between anxiety and pain is not always positive or unidirectional. 
Von Hippel-Lindau disease and erythrocytosis: radioimmunoassay of erythropoietin in cyst fluid from a brainstem hemangioblastoma. A 59-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease developed erythrocytosis and a recurrent intracranial hemangioblastoma. Radioimmunoassay showed an elevated level of erythropoietin in her serum. Cyst fluid from the tumor also contained erythropoietin, concentrated a thousandfold relative to the serum level. Production of erythropoietin by hemangioblastomas may explain the erythrocytosis present in some patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. 
One hundred ten consecutive primary orthotopic liver transplants under FK 506 in adults. An account is given of the 6- to 12-month survival, and causes of failure in 110 consecutive patients who underwent primary liver transplantation under treatment from the outset with FK 506 and steroids. The patient survival is 92.7%, and the first graft survival is 87.3%. At a very high frequency, the patients achieved good graft function, and they had a relatively low morbidity that was partially ascribable to minimal use and early discontinuance (in 60% of cases) of steroids. Renal dysfunction and other adverse findings were largely confined to patients with poor initial graft function and consequent apparent alteration of the kinetics of FK 506 elimination, causing functional overdosage. Results compare very favorably with our past record using conventional immunosuppression, and support the belief that FK 506 is a superior immunosuppressive agent which is suitable for chronic administration. 
Alcohol consumption of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation. We studied the recent alcohol consumption and other possible precipitating factors in 99 consecutive patients (53 men and 46 women) all under 65 years of age with sustained re-entry and automatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and compared them with those of two groups of controls. One control group was derived from the Emergency Room patients and matched for age and sex; the other group (44 men, 22 women, mean age 48.7 years) was randomly selected from the general out-of-hospital population. There were 50 patients with supraventricular tachycardia, 30 with atrial flutter, and 19 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Coronary heart disease (14% of patients), hypertension (10%), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases associated with the arrhythmias. The self-reported alcohol consumption of patients with arrhythmias during the week preceding the arrhythmia did not differ significantly from that of hospital or population controls, although significantly more patients than controls had liver enzyme levels above normal; neither were there any significant differences between the groups regarding prevalence for alcoholism as judged by the CAGE questionnaire. The results were essentially similar when patients with supraventricular tachycardia and those with intra-atrial tachyarrhythmias (flutter and paroxysmal tachycardia) were separately compared with the controls. We conclude that alcohol consumption, although a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, is not associated with the induction of other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients of working age. 
Intensive combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation leads to the reappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fifteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or alpha-interferon therapy were included in this study. Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission. 
Progressive myoclonic ataxia (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome). It has been suggested from studies of patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy that the term Ramsay Hunt syndrome should be abandoned, as its use has led to nosologic confusion, and because, in the light of modern diagnostic techniques, the majority of cases can be allocated to specific disease categories, chiefly, Unverricht-Lundborg disease (Baltic myoclonus) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Review of 30 cases of this syndrome, defined as progressive ataxia and myoclonus and infrequent seizures in the absence of dementia, showed that a clinical or biochemically supported diagnosis could not be made in 43%. This low diagnostic yield probably reflects differences in ascertainment of patients; those described here were referred with a syndrome of progressive myoclonic ataxia (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome) rather than progressive myoclonus epilepsy. These two syndromes share common causes, but a smaller proportion of patients with progressive myoclonic ataxia can currently be diagnosed precisely during life. 
Tetanic response of the cricothyroid muscle. Tetanic response of canine cricothyroid muscle tissue was investigated through a series of experiments conducted in vitro. Two separate portions of the cricothyroid muscle, namely the pars recta and pars oblique, were studied. Samples of the muscle were dissected from dog larynges excised a few minutes before death and kept in Krebs-Ringer solution at a temperature of 37 degrees +/- 1 degrees C and a pH of 7.4 +/- 0.05. Tetanic contraction of the muscle samples was obtained by field stimulation to the muscle through a pair of parallel-plate platinum electrodes and with a train of square pulses of 0.1-millisecond duration and 85-V amplitude. Isometric force responses of the pars recta and pars oblique muscles were obtained electronically with a dual servo system (ergometer). The effect of tissue elongation on the active and passive responses was quantified by stimulation of the sample during cyclic elongation. Both active and passive responses as a function of elongation were obtained on the same sample. 
Clinical symptoms in young adults with atypical chest pain attending the emergency department. Clinical symptoms were studied in 69 consecutive patients below the age of 40 years who were attending the emergency unit because of unexplained chest pain. In a structured interview a few weeks after the emergency visit, only one-third of the patients reported that they believed in the doctor's diagnosis; they believed in a psychological or cardiac origin of the pain more often than the doctors. The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing. In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided. Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling. Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported. On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed. We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance. 
Failure of infection control in intensive care units: can sucralfate improve the situation? Conventional infection control measures in intensive care units (ICUs) are aimed primarily at stemming cross-infections. The role of patients' endogenous flora in the pathogenesis of nosocomial infection and occasional lapses in aseptic technique in ICUs help to explain the frequent failure of the conventional approaches. Newer control strategies include avoiding gastric and oropharyngeal overgrowth of gram-negative bacilli by using sucralfate to avoid gastric alkalinization and/or suppressing nosocomial flora by use of topical antimicrobials. 
Shower versus sink bath: evaluation of heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective response of the patient with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a sitting shower versus a sitting sink bath in low-risk patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Heart rate, blood pressure (mean blood pressure and rate-pressure-product), ratings of perceived exertion, and occurrence of symptoms during the baths and between resting, bathing, and recovery periods were evaluated. Thirty patients with MI were tested during their first and second self-bath on 2 consecutive days between 2 and 9 days after MI. The bathing methods produced significant increases from the resting values in all the variables (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences between the resting and recovery values existed (p greater than 0.05). Ten subjects experienced atypical responses to bathing as indicated by heart rate and blood pressures. Fatigue was the most frequently encountered symptom at rest and during the bathing activities. The findings suggest that low-risk patients with MI can choose between a sitting sink bath or a sitting shower as their first self-bath after MI, based on preferences. However, because the bathing activity (and not the bathing method) did produce some atypical responses in one third of the subjects, readiness to engage in bathing activities should be individually assessed by objective and subjective criteria. 
Functional myocardial impairment in children treated with anthracyclines for cancer. A non-invasive exercise method was used to look for myocardial damage in apparently normal children who had received moderate doses of anthracyclines for treatment of cancer. 19 children (mean [SD] age 10.6 [4.3] years) who had received anthracyclines (mean total dose 230 [119] mg/m2) and 10 who had received other cytotoxic drugs (mean age 13.3 [4.9] years) were selected from 263 children attending routine follow-up examinations. They underwent measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, and left ventricular dimensions by echocardiography before and after exercise on a bicycle for a maximum of 10 min. All 29 were in remission. All the subjects showed normal fractional shortening (FS = left ventricular end-diastolic minus end-systolic diameter as a percentage of the end-diastolic diameter) at rest, but the increase in FS on exercise was significantly lower in the children who had received anthracyclines than in those who had not (3 [16]% vs 23 [17]%; p less than 0.05). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and drug exposure. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the adjusted mean percentage changes on exercise in heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Disease type had no effect on the cardiological indices. Thus, many children who have received anthracyclines may have suffered subclinical myocardial damage. Post-exercise echocardiography seems a useful non-invasive method for detecting such damage. Long-term cardiological follow-up of these patients is needed. 
Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm presenting as recurrent epistaxis. Massive epistaxis from a leaking intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is a rare occurrence. Such an unusual case is presented with appropriate imaging and a successful treatment program. 
Pharmacology of the nitrovasodilators. Antianginal, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet actions. The nitrovasodilators, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside, cause both arterial and venous smooth muscle dilation by the intracellular release of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an accumulation of cyclic GMP. The endogenous formation of nitric oxide results in vasodilatory activity similar to the nitrovasodilators. Nitroglycerin is commonly used in the treatment of angina pectoris because of its ability to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. Most likely, this response occurs as a result of a reduction in preload, which can decrease arterial wall tension and improve coronary blood flow. This pharmacologic effect warrants the use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of myocardial ischemia or infarction, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Sodium nitroprusside is effective in reducing arterial blood pressure in hypertensive crisis as a result of systemic vasodilation leading to a reduction in preload and afterload. Sodium nitroprusside is not as effective in the treatment of angina pectoris or in diminishing of myocardial ischemia because it does not preferentially improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium over nonischemic myocardium. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has been demonstrated with these drugs, but the clinical applications need further investigation. Nursing interventions for the patient on nitrovasodilator therapy include careful hemodynamic monitoring and drug infusion, along with elimination of physical and emotional stimuli that can aggravate the patient's underlying pathology. 
Sudden death due to disease flare with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for carcinoma of the prostate. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer is a new method of management for metastatic disease. During the initial 1 to 2-week period of administration an increase in serum testosterone concentration can lead to an exacerbation of clinical symptoms (flare phenomenon). Two patients are summarized who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy without flare blockade and died suddenly during month 1 of therapy. A review of 765 patients in 9 series found 10.9% who suffered disease flare and 15 who died during disease flare. Of these 17 patients 12 were similar to our 2. These data suggest that any patient placed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer merits some form of flare blockade during the initial 1 or 2 months of therapy. 
Acute central nervous system complications after pulse steroid therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed an acute psychosis and a cerebrovascular accident after pulse methylprednisolone therapy. A literature review revealed 8 additional patients with SLE with acute central nervous system complications after pulse therapy. 
Vascular complications of cardiac catheterization. Femoral artery injury after diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization is a frequently encountered clinical problem. This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed. 
Malignant astrocytomas: focal tumor recurrence after focal external beam radiation therapy. Hochberg and Pruitt have reported glioblastomas recurring within 2 cm of the primary site in 90% of patients after whole-brain radiation therapy. They suggested that computerized tomography (CT) scan accuracy would permit smaller radiation fields. A treatment protocol with smaller-field focal brain irradiation following surgical resection is reported. The first 4500 cGy of radiation is focused to within a 3-cm margin around the tumor, with a 1500-cGy boost within a 1.5-cm margin. Forty-two patients with grade III or IV astrocytoma, treated with focal brain radiation therapy were reviewed retrospectively to assess patterns of tumor recurrence. Thirty patients received intra-arterial bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) radiosensitization with focal brain radiation therapy, and 12 patients underwent conventional focal brain radiation therapy. Tumor margin was defined on preoperative and recurrence CT scans as the contrast-enhanced area; these were traced on acetate templates and compared with each other and with the actual scans. In all 42 patients, the lesion recurred within a 2-cm margin of the original tumor. Four patients had two recurrent areas: the second area was within the 2-cm margin in two, and outside this margin in two. These results are similar to those of Hochberg and Pruitt. It is suggested that focal irradiation is now the optimal treatment for malignant astrocytoma. Since recurrences continue to be within the irradiated volumes, it appears that higher focal doses of radiation are appropriate for clinical treatment trials of malignant astrocytomas. 
Abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Association with neurological dysfunction. An increased prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report an unexpectedly high prevalence (20%) of such abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism in a population of HIV-infected patients referred for neurological evaluation. This abnormality was associated with both peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy. A majority of those treated with cyanocobalamin had a therapeutic response. Selected neuropathological results suggest a relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and vacuolar myelopathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be a frequent and treatable cause of neurological dysfunction in patients with HIV infection. 
Photodynamic killing of human squamous cell carcinoma cells using a monoclonal antibody-photosensitizer conjugate. We have developed procedures in which the photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD) can be covalently linked to carrier molecules of modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce water-soluble PVA-BPD conjugates with a molecular mass in the range of 30 kd. These carriers can subsequently be covalently linked to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) using heterobifunctional linking agents. We describe here such a conjugate in which the MoAb (5E8) has specificity for a glycoprotein detected on human squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. We provide evidence that the conjugates produced were covalently linked and retained both their photosensitizing and antigen-binding activities. We show further that the MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate, in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, exhibited highly enhanced phototoxic killing of the target cell line (A549) over that exhibited by free BPD or a control MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate. These results demonstrate, therefore, both the selectivity and specificity of this MoAb conjugate. 
An in vivo model of experimental arterial stenosis, intimal damage, and periodic thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a "critical stenosis." Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury. 
Growth hormone treatment of growth failure secondary to total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Growth hormone was given to 13 children (nine boys, four girls) with acute leukaemia who had undergone treatment with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation. Mean age at total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation was 9.0 years (range 3.7-15.8). Endocrinological investigation was carried out at a mean of 2.0 years (range 0.4-4.0) after bone marrow transplantation. Peak serum growth hormone responses to hypoglycaemia were less than 10.0 micrograms/l (less than 20.0 mU/l) in 10, 10.5 micrograms/l (21.0 mU/l) in one, greater than 16.0 micrograms/l (greater than 32.0 mU/l) in two patients. Mean age of the patients at the start of growth hormone treatment was 12.2 years (range 5.8-18.2). The mean time between total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation and the start of growth hormone treatment was 3.2 years (range, 1.1-5.0). Height velocity SD score (SD) increased from a mean pretreatment value of -1.27 (0.65) to + 0.22 (0.81) in the first year, +0.16 (1.11) in the second year, and +0.42 (0.71) in the third year of treatment. Height SD score (SD) changed only slightly from -1.52 (0.42) to -1.50 (0.47) in the first year, to -1.50 (0.46) in the second year, and -1.74 (0.92) in the third year. Measurement of segmental proportions showed no significant increase in subischial leg length from -0.87 (0.67) to -0.63 (0.65) in the first year, to -0.58 (0.70) in the second year, and -0.80 (1.14) in the third year of treatment. 
Disseminated leiomyosarcoma in a child with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A child with disseminated leiomyosarcoma and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is reported. She was originally believed to have peptic ulcer disease by radiographic and endoscopic evaluation but was found subsequently to have hypergastrinemia, hypochlorhydria, and a smooth muscle tumor. Leiomyosarcoma in children and its evolution in AIDS are discussed. 
Improvement of cyclosporin absorption in children after liver transplantation by means of water-soluble vitamin E. Many childhood recipients of liver transplantation require massive doses of cyclosporin to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations of the drug. The impaired absorption of this strongly lipophilic drug may be due to reduced intestinal absorptive area, suboptimal mixing of the drug with hepatobiliary secretions, or residual cholestasis. Improvement of cyclosporin absorption was sought by means of oral coadministration of d-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene-glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS), a water-soluble form of vitamin E which can form micelles. 25 mg/kg daily of TPGS was given to six paediatric liver transplant recipients and one young adult with severe hepatobiliary graft-vs-host disease after bone-marrow transplantation, who required 29-136 mg/kg cyclosporin daily to achieve therapeutic cyclosporin blood concentrations. Five responded; the oral cyclosporin dose could be reduced by 40-72% within 2 months. In addition, intravenous cyclosporin was stopped in two of the responders. In the two non-responders the cyclosporin doses at entry were similar to those in the responders after TPGS treatment. Oral cyclosporin absorption tests correctly predicted the outcome of treatment in three responders and one non-responder tested. Treatment with TPGS to enhance cyclosporin absorption might be a useful way of reducing the high cost of immunosuppression in paediatric liver transplant recipients. 
Effect of coronary reocclusion after initial reperfusion on ventricular function and infarct size. Reocclusion of a coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy occurs in approximately 12% to 33% of patients; however, there are few experimental data concerning reocclusion. Accordingly, to compare the effects of reocclusion versus sustained occlusion on the myocardium, a canine model (n = 12) of 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion, 1 h of reperfusion and 1 h of reocclusion was studied. In a control group (n = 11), 3 h of circumflex artery occlusion was followed by 1 h of reperfusion. As a result, both groups had the same total duration of ischemia (3 h) and reperfusion (1 h). Hemodynamic measurements, radioactive microsphere injections and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed at baseline, occlusion and reperfusion for both groups and at the end of reocclusion for the experimental group. In vivo risk area was determined with Evans blue dye and infarct size with triphenyltetrazolium staining methods. Similar decreases in myocardial blood flow after coronary occlusion and similar reperfusion blood flows occurred in both groups. Despite intervening reperfusion in the reocclusion group, no significant difference was found in the infarct size/risk area ratio between the reocclusion and control groups (54.5 +/- 6.9% vs. 48.4 +/- 5.1%, respectively, p = NS). Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated a similar degree and extent (159 +/- 9 degrees vs. 153 +/- 12 degrees, p = NS) of left ventricular dysfunction with both the occlusion and reocclusion. In addition, there were no significant differences in global or regional left ventricular function between the two groups. However, reocclusion after reperfusion did produce a further deterioration in ischemic zone wall thickening (9.5 +/- 2.0% to 0.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma: treatment with a combination therapy of transcatheter arterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. In an attempt to obtain complete tumor necrosis in large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, the authors studied the clinical and histologic findings of a new combination therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) (pretreatment with TAE and subsequent PEI) in 15 patients with a single, large (3.0-9.0 cm in diameter), encapsulated lesion of HCC. Two weeks after TAE, PEI was performed under ultrasound guidance. A total of four to 11 injections were administered at a rate of one injection twice a week. During the follow-up period (range, 7-23 months), all lesions were reduced in size and no evidence of HCC was present at contrast material-enhanced computed tomography or angiography in nine of 11 patients who did not subsequently undergo surgery. Six patients had a follow-up of 1 year or more, for a 1-year survival rate of 100%. Four patients subsequently underwent surgical resection; complete necrosis of the tumor was observed in all four. The authors conclude that a combination of PEI and TAE is an appropriate treatment for patients with large, encapsulated HCC lesions who are poor surgical risks. 
Simultaneous in situ genotyping and phenotyping of human papillomavirus cervical lesions: comparative sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of immunocytochemistry were compared with those of non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) for the direct detection of human papillomaviruses in biopsy specimens. Four monoclonal antibodies raised to the capsid protein of HPV16 were less specific than NISH: all four reacted with lesions containing HPV33, and HPV18. Absolute discrimination of HPV types, therefore, was not possible with the monoclonal antibodies used in this study. The relative sensitivities of these antibodies were also lower than NISH. Sequential immunocytochemistry and NISH on the same section showed that 2.9-13.0 times as many cells were positive by NISH than by immunocytochemistry using the most sensitive monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that NISH has higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to the HPV16 capsid protein. 
Intestinal mucosal permeability in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. II. Role of disease. Gut permeability as measured by the 51Cr-EDTA resorption test was determined in 56 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 73 patients with spondyloarthropathies (SpA), 18 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 97 controls (42 patients with no inflammatory rheumatic diseases and 55 healthy controls). Gut permeability was found to be increased in the 3 patient groups, partially due to the intake of antiinflammatory drugs. When only patients not taking these drugs were considered, an increased gut permeability was found in patients with SpA and IBD. In patients with RA gut permeability could not be evaluated as they were all taking antiinflammatory medication. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies of the gut was performed in 62 of the 73 patients with SpA and disclosed subclinical gut inflammation in 21. No difference in gut permeability was found between patients with or without gut inflammation. However, when the type of gut inflammation was considered, a significant increase of gut permeability was found in patients with chronic gut inflammation compared with patients presenting acute lesions. Our findings again suggest that the chronic gut inflammation seen in SpA is fundamentally different from acute gut inflammation and possibly related to the gut inflammation of IBD. 
Positron emission tomography of pituitary macroadenomas: hormone production and effects of therapies. Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was carried out in 24 patients with pituitary macroadenomas (32 studies) to assess the glucose utilization of these tumors in vivo. The adenoma metabolic index, which is the ratio of FDG uptake of tumor to a whole brain slice, was calculated. Comparisons were made between tumor uptake of FDG and hormone secretion and response to therapies. In each positron emission tomography study, the macroadenoma could be easily identified visually as an area of increased FDG uptake near the region of the sella. FDG uptakes were highest for nonfunctional adenomas, and the prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing groups displayed similar levels of glucose metabolism. The adenoma metabolic index for all tumors averaged 1.3, ranging from 0.3 for a thyroid-stimulating hormone adenoma to 3.5 for a nonfunctional tumor. Tumors did not exhibit metabolic rates that could characterize the type of hormone produced. Recurrent macroadenomas displayed metabolism similar to tumors not operated on, whereas irradiated adenomas showed lower glucose uptake than nonirradiated tumors. Drug therapy with bromocriptine or the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide also decreased the glucose utilization of the tumor. There was no correlation between the amount of hormone produced and the adenoma metabolic index when a group of tumors was analyzed. Patients scanned more than once, however, demonstrated changes in hormone levels that changed or did not change in parallel with tumor metabolism. Thus, positron emission tomography offers the potential capability for predicting and defining the growth of pituitary adenomas. This may be of particular value when plasma hormone assays and conventional imaging techniques prove inadequate for monitoring patient response to therapy. 
Hypertonic saline dextran resuscitation during the initial phase of acute endotoxemia: effect on regional blood flow. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Small-volume resuscitation by means of bolus application of hypertonic saline solutions has been demonstrated to restore central hemodynamics and regional blood flow in severe hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential of this new concept for treatment of profound hypovolemia and microcirculatory deterioration associated with sepsis and endotoxic shock. In a porcine model of acute hyperdynamic endotoxemia (elicited by continuous iv infusion of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin for 3.5 hrs), small-volume resuscitation applying hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions was analyzed for its effect on central hemodynamics, oxygen delivery (Do2), and regional blood flow. Fluid therapy was initiated when the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) tended to decrease (at 43 to 52 mins of endotoxemia), and consisted of 4 mL/kg bolus infusion of either 7.2% sodium chloride, 10% dextran, or 10% dextran in 7.2% sodium chloride; thereafter, PAOP was maintained by controlled infusion of 6% dextran-60. In a control group, 6% dextran-60 was given without preinjection of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions. RESULTS: On small-volume resuscitation, cardiac index significantly increased within 5 mins in all groups, while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Fluid requirements were significantly reduced after small-volume resuscitation and the hyperdynamic circulatory state was maintained until the end of the observation period; Do2 as well as blood flow to heart, kidneys, and splanchnic organs remained high. CONCLUSION: Small-volume resuscitation by means of hypertonic saline-dextran proved the most effective, and seems to be an attractive supportive therapy to prevent microcirculatory failure in sepsis and endotoxemia. 
The importance of preoperative evaluation of the subclavian vein in dialysis access planning. Adequate venous outflow is critical to the proper function of a vascular-access graft (arteriovenous fistula) used for chronic hemodialysis. Stenosis of the subclavian vein can significantly compromise this venous outflow. The development of such subclavian vein stenoses has been associated with the prior placement of temporary subclavian vein dialysis catheters. We evaluated the importance of preoperative detection of these stenoses before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in the upper extremity. Upper extremity venography was performed before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in 43 patients. A total of 62 extremities were evaluated. A 40% prevalence of moderate or severe subclavian vein stenosis was found in patients with prior or existing temporary dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. No stenoses were found in patients without a history of dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. This difference in the prevalence of subclavian vein stenosis is statistically significant (p less than .001). In no case was the stenosis suspected clinically. Before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft, the subclavian vein should be evaluated in all patients with a history of a temporary dialysis catheter in the subclavian vein. The use of sites other than the subclavian vein for temporary dialysis is strongly encouraged. 
Sarcoidosis presenting as an isolated intramedullary tumor. We report a case of isolated intramedullary sarcoidosis. The patient developed progressive signs that indicated a spinal tumor, which were investigated with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly revealed an intramedullary lesion, but the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the pathological analysis of the surgical specimen. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast enhancement is reported in a histologically proven case of intramedullary sarcoidosis. Only 12 other cases of isolated intramedullary sarcoidosis have been reported. We review and discuss these cases according to their clinical presentation, the segmental location of the granulomas in the spinal cord, preoperative and operative diagnoses, and signs for systemic sarcoidosis. In none of the cases was the diagnosis of intramedullary sarcoidosis made before surgery. We think that surgical therapy for intramedullary lesions is the best way to diagnose rare instances of benign lesions like sarcoidosis and to treat them in an appropriate manner. 
Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin response after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth-I type of reconstruction. Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) responses were measured after a pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) using the Billroth-I type reconstruction combined with distal partial gastrectomy (standard PD) and combined with preservation of the pylorus and the duodenal bulb (PPPD). Six unoperated patients, 4 men and 2 women, were studied as control subjects. Basal plasma levels of gastrin were significantly higher in controls than in patients who had a standard PD (p less than 0.05) and gastrin responses to a meal were also blunted in these patients. In contrast basal and postprandial levels of gastrin after PPPD were significantly higher than these found in patients with standard PD (p less than 0.05). Postprandial gastrin response after PPPD were similar in pattern to these found in controls. Integrated gastrin release after PPPD was less than that of the control but was significantly greater than that in patients with standard PD. Basal plasma levels of CCK in the patients after the standard PD were significantly lower than in controls and significantly higher postprandial levels of CCK were found after PPPD compared to standard PD (p less than 0.05). However integrated CCK from 0 to 120 minutes were not significantly different between PPPD and standard PD groups. Based on these observations concerning hormonal release of gastrin and CCK, preservation of the stomach and the duodenal bulb appears to be a more physiologic reconstructive procedure than the standard PD. In addition the operation probably has more beneficial effect on the injured pancreas in time. 
Preoperative and postoperative "aneurysm" associated with coarctation of the aorta. The reported incidence of aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine the incidence of aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1.5 +/- 3.4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the repair site or by abnormal dimensions at the repair site, defined by the ratio of the widest measurement at the repair site to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23%) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4.72 +/- 4.07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the repair site were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the repair site, one had an abnormally high repair site to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5%) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical repair site. In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair. 
Prognostic value of serum creatinine and effect of treatment of hypertension on renal function. Results from the hypertension detection and follow-up program. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Cooperative Group. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program followed up 10,940 persons for 5 years in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of treatment for hypertension. Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups, stepped care and referred care. The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality, with morbid events involving the heart, brain, and kidney as secondary end points. Loss of renal function, ascertained by a change in serum creatinine, was among these secondary events. Baseline serum creatinine concentration had a significant prognostic value for 8-year mortality. For persons with a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, 8-year mortality was more than three times that of all other participants. The estimated 5-year incidence of substantial decline in renal function was 21.7/1,000 in the stepped-care group and 24.6/1,000 in the referred-care group. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level between 1.5 and 1.7 mg/dl, the 5-year incidence of decline was 113.3/1,000 (stepped care) and 226.6/1,000 (referred care) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of decline in renal function was greater in men, blacks, and older adults, as well as in those with higher entry diastolic blood pressure. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, serum creatinine concentration declined by 25% or more in 28.6% of stepped-care and 25.2% of referred-care participants. Although the incidence of clinically significant hypercreatininemia in a hypertensive population is low, an elevated serum creatinine concentration is a very potent independent risk factor for mortality. The slightly lower rate of development of hypercreatininemia and the higher rate of improvement in stepped-care compared with referred-care participants is consistent with the belief that aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce renal damage and the associated increased risk of death. 
Integration of anticoagulation, thrombolysis and coronary angioplasty for unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina pectoris remains a challenging acute ischemic syndrome to treat despite recent randomized trials that confirm the benefit of intravenous heparin. Coronary angioplasty, which is often required to treat the underlying arterial lesion, is adversely affected by the presence of thrombus with at least a 2-fold increase in abrupt closure. Four studies with heparin treatment prior to angioplasty indicate a reduction of abrupt vessel closure from 8-33% to 0-6% with apparent reduction of morbidity; no controlled trials are thus far available for heparin pretreatment. Another therapeutic alternative, thrombolytic therapy, has had quite equivocal results with several negative small studies. When angioplasty has been performed with thrombolytic therapy, a nonfibrin-specific plasminogen activator appears to be preferable. Newer studies that focus on thrombin inhibitors that bind to clot-bound thrombin and potent antiplatelet agents are in the early phase of clinical investigation. This review offers current recommendations for the integration of heparin, thrombolysis, and coronary angioplasty for unstable angina pectoris. 
DNA flow cytometric evaluation of serous and mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. There have been few reports of flow cytometric studies of pancreatic neoplasms, whether endocrine or exocrine. In this report, the DNA content of three mucinous and seven serous cystic tumors of the pancreas was evaluated by flow cytometry on formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Two serous cystadenomas were aneuploid, with the remaining five serous and all three mucinous being diploid. All cases had a low S phase (ranging from 0.1% to 3.1%), indicating neoplasms with a low turnover. From these results, it appeared that DNA flow cytometry as an independent factor did not discriminate between the benign pancreatic serous cystadenomas and the more aggressive mucinous cystic neoplasms. 
Phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline for the prevention of transplant-related toxicities following bone marrow transplantation. Disease relapse and transplant related toxicities have limited the application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the treatment for hematologic malignancies. Because elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been correlated with the development of transplant related complications, we conducted a phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative capable of down-regulating TNF-alpha production, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing BMT. Thirty consecutive adult patients (median age, 34) were entered and received either an allogeneic (n = 26) or autologous (n = 4) BMT. Patients were enrolled at increasing dose levels (1,200, 1,600, and 2,000 mg/d) from day -10 through day +100 posttransplant. PTX was well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects noted at any of the dose levels administered. The actuarial day 100 survival for these 30 patients was 90% (95% confidence interval 79% to 100%). When compared with a good risk control group, PTX recipients experienced less mucositis (3.7 +/- 1.1 v 18.7 +/- 1.1 days, P = .004), less hepatic venocclusive disease (10% v 65%, P = .001), a lower incidence of renal insufficiency (3% v 65%, P = .0003), required less days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (24.0 +/- 1.3 v 35.0 +/- 2.4, P = .001) and were discharged from the hospital earlier than controls (day 26.0 +/- 1.8 v 37.0 +/- 3.8, P = .01). In addition the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade II was also reduced among the PTX recipients (35% v 68%, P = .03). PTX at doses in excess of 1,200 mg/d further reduced the severity of mucositis, and TPN requirements resulting in earlier hospital discharge than patients receiving 1,200 mg/d of PTX. In this study oral administration of PTX in doses up to 2,000 mg/d was well tolerated and associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT. Prospective randomized trials are currently in progress to test these preliminary observations. 
Tumor vascularization: assessment with duplex sonography. In this prospective study, the authors examined 123 patients with benign or malignant neoplasms (breast cancer, n = 44; liver neoplasms, n = 43; and tumors affecting other organs, n = 36) to establish general criteria for evaluation of neoplastic lesions by means of duplex sonography. The frequency shifts determined by means of different Doppler frequencies (2.31 or 3.75 MHz) were converted into flow velocities. Only the highest systolic peak flow velocity obtained from a lesion was used for statistical evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that a flow velocity of 0.4 m/sec is the optimal threshold value with which to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. The data obtained in all lesions indicated that only positive findings are potentially reliable. It is concluded that negative results of sonography should not be used to diagnose the presence of a benign lesion. The resistive index of the tumors was of negligible importance. 
Deforming arthropathy complicating primary biliary cirrhosis. A 53-year-old woman with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) developed a deforming but minimally symptomatic arthropathy. The simultaneous occurrence of SLE and PBC is believed to be rare. Moreover, destructive arthritis, in the absence of serum rheumatoid factor, has not been previously reported with either disease. We review the association of liver disease with arthritis and propose a possible mechanism to account for the severe joint destruction seen in our patient. 
Evidence for alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in hypotensive cirrhotic patients with ascites. Cirrhosis with ascites is often characterized by arterial hypotension associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels. Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings. 
Compound heterozygosity in nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalanemia: the contribution of mutations for classical phenylketonuria. Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) results from defective hydroxylation of phenylalanine in the liver, in most cases because of defective phenylalanine hydroxylase. HPA is highly variable, ranging from moderate elevation of plasma phenylalanine with no clinical consequences to a severe disease, classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Non-PKU HPA was found in excess of PKU in Israel, while the opposite is true in Europe. To study the genetic basis of non-PKU HPA, we performed haplotype analysis at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in 27 families with non-PKU HPA. All individuals with this condition were compound heterozygotes. In six of these families, in which both PKU and non-PKU HPA were segregating, haplotype analysis showed that non-PKU HPA resulted from compound heterozygosity for a PKU mutation and a second mutation, with milder effect, which is probably expressed only when it interacts with the severe mutation. The involvement of PKU mutations in non-PKU HPA was further demonstrated in Jewish Yemenite families with non-PKU HPA, in which the individuals with this condition were carriers of the single PKU allele which exists in this community. In addition, two previously known PKU point mutations (R261Q and R408W) were found in individuals with non-PKU HPA. These mutations are associated, in our population, with the same haplotypes as those with which it is associated in Europe. Based on the above-mentioned genetic model for non-PKU HPA, successful prenatal diagnosis of this condition was performed in one family. 
In vivo pharmacology of DuP 753. A review of the in vivo pharmacology of DuP 753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphen yl-4- yl)methyl]imidazole, potassium salt) is presented. In the pithed rat, DuP 753 exerted a selective and competitive inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin II (AII). In conscious normotensive rats, DuP 753 inhibited the AII-induced aldosterone secretion and drinking response. DuP 753 lowered blood pressure in conscious normotensive rats pretreated with furosemide but not in untreated normotensive rats. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 given intravenously did not cause pressor response. In conscious renal hypertensive rats (RHRs), a high renin model, DuP 753 decreased blood pressure with an intravenous ED30 of 0.78 mg/kg and an oral ED30 of 0.59 mg/kg. The antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 in RHRs was similar to that of captopril. In DOCA hypertensive rats, a low renin model, DuP 753 did not lower blood pressure. In conscious 18- to 21-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), DuP 753 given orally or intravenously reduced blood pressure dose-dependently and did not alter heart rate at these doses. The acute antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was greater than that of captopril in SHRs. In contrast, DuP 753 and captopril given orally at 10 mg/kg/day for 15 days in SHRs caused a similar decrease in blood pressure. Bilateral nephrectomy but not inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis abolished the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in SHRs. Our study, therefore, indicates that DuP 753 is an orally active, nonpeptide, selective, and competitive AII receptor antagonist lacking agonism. It appears that there is a relationship between basal renin level and the acute antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in rats. Further, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the control of blood pressure in conscious SHRs. 
Intermediate term results of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation from two centers. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has become established for selected infants with severe forms of congenital heart disease. This study reviews the combined experience and intermediate term results of infants undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation from Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, and Kosair Children's Hospital, Louisville. From June 1986 through December 1989, 20 orthotopic cardiac transplantations were performed in 19 patients. Sixteen patients had variants of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One infant had anomalous origin of the left coronary artery with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two infants had aortic stenosis with endocardial fibroelastosis, and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to transplantation. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran), and corticosteroids with an effort to wean the patients from steroids by 6 months to 2 years. Three early deaths resulted--from technical errors in two patients and from hyperacute rejection in one patient at 3 days. Four late deaths have occurred. Two patients died at 2 and 13 months of acute rejection. One patient died at 15 months of acute rejection after retransplantation. One patient died at 7 months of respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia. The remaining 12 patients are surviving 5 to 47 months (means 20 months) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Rejection surveillance in the first 6 months is by clinical signs supplemented by echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cell cycle analysis; endomyocardial biopsy is used after 6 months of age. For the cumulative series, 24 episodes of suspected rejection have been treated during 277 at-risk patient months with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) (n = 18) and monoclonal antibody (OKT3) (n = 6), for an incidence of 1.04 episodes of rejection per patient per year. Serious posttransplantation infections including endocarditis, catheter sepsis, meningitis, and colonic perforation were successfully treated in four patients. Subjectively, their quality of life is excellent as shown by normal growth and developmental milestones and a low hospital readmission rate (1.4 episodes per patient per year). These encouraging intermediate term results warrant continued application of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation for severe forms of congenital heart disease. 
Urinary tract calculi that form on surgical staples: a characteristic radiologic appearance. An autostapler is frequently used when bowel is interposed in the urinary tract during reconstructive urologic surgery in children. Usually the metallic staples are buried beneath the intestinal mucosa. However, if a portion of a staple is unintentionally left exposed or becomes exposed through migration and is then bathed by urine, it can become the nidus for formation of a calculus. The radiologic studies of 30 patients having surgery of this type in our hospital from 1980 to 1990 were reviewed prospectively, and stones were found to have developed on staples in eight patients. None of the patients had metabolic abnormalities. The stones were easily visible on plain radiographs because they were calcified. They formed in the lumen of the bladder or the bowel segment on the exposed portion of the staple. Thus, the staple was eccentric in the calculus and not central, as is usually the case with a stone forming on a foreign body. This experience suggests that stones forming on surgical staples during reconstructive urologic surgery have a characteristic radiologic appearance that may aid in their identification. 
Sleep-induced periodic breathing and apnea: a theoretical study. To elucidate the mechanisms that lead to sleep-disordered breathing, we have developed a mathematical model that allows for dynamic interactions among the chemical control of respiration, changes in sleep-waking state, and changes in upper airway patency. The increase in steady-state arterial PCO2 accompanying sleep is shown to be inversely related to the ventilatory response to CO2. Chemical control of respiration becomes less stable during the light stage of sleep, despite a reduction in chemoresponsiveness, due to a concomitant increase in "plant gain" (i.e., responsiveness of blood gases to ventilatory changes). The withdrawal of the "wakefulness drive" during sleep onset represents a strong perturbation to respiratory control: higher magnitudes and rates of withdrawal of this drive favor instability. These results may account for the higher incidence of periodic breathing observed during light sleep and sleep onset. Periodic ventilation can also result from repetitive alternations between sleep onset and arousal. The potential for instability is further compounded if the possibility of upper airway occlusion is also included. In systems with high controller gains, instability is mediated primarily through chemoreflex overcompensation. However, in systems with depressed chemoresponsiveness, rapid sleep onset and large blood gas fluctuations trigger repetitive episodes of arousal and hyperpnea alternating with apneas that may or may not be obstructive. Between these extremes, more complex patterns can arise from the interaction between chemoreflex-mediated oscillations of shorter-cycle-duration (approximately 36 s) and longer-wavelength (approximately 60-80 s) state-driven oscillations. 
Neuroeffector functions of sensory fibres: implications for headache mechanisms and drug actions. The results of recent investigations designed to elucidate the neuroeffector functions of sensory fibres, the cause of migraine headache and the mechanism of action of antimigraine drugs are reviewed and discussed. Neurogenic inflammation (vasodilatation and neurogenic plasma extravasation) is one explanation for the development of headaches and the blood flow changes which occur during migraine headache. Numerous studies have recently been carried out on rats and guinea-pigs into the effects of antimigraine agents, including ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater induced by electrical stimulation of trigeminal ganglia or systemic administration of capsaicin. It is known that the dura mater is able to produce headaches in man. Ergot alkaloids have been shown to block neurogenic inflammation via a C-fibre dependent neuronal mechanism. Sumatriptan appears to act fairly similarly although, whereas the ergot alkaloids are non-selective for either 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) receptors or 5-HT1, sumatriptan is selective for 5-HT1 receptors. The antimigraine action of NSAIDs may be via either an effect on blood vessels or an effect on the nerve fibre. The antimigraine effects of ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and NSAIDs are discussed in the light of the common vasoconstrictor actions of these agents and knowledge that vasodilatation is apparently not responsible for migraine headache pain in most cases. 
Degree of coronary artery disease predicted by exercise testing. The ability of exercise testing to predict the extent of coronary artery disease was examined in 268 male patients undergoing both coronary angiography and bicycle testing with electrocardiography before coronary artery bypass surgery. When maximal ST-depressions limited by symptoms increased from 0 to 4 mm or more, the percentage of patients with 'serious' coronary disease, defined as either triple vessel disease or left main stem stenosis, increased from 50% to 80% (P = 0.0001). The patients in the lowest third of physical work capacity showed only a slightly increased risk of serious disease. This tendency was abolished in patients who were using beta-blockers, whereas the relationship between ST-depression and disease was not affected by this medication. The probability of finding left main stem stenosis in a patient increased from 5 to 30% with increasing ST-depression: beta-blockers did not affect this relationship, but there was no additional predictive effect of implicating the level of physical work capacity. It is concluded that traditional electrocardiography during exercise is of value when selecting patients for angiography, but that the physical work level obtained during the test does not predict the degree of coronary pathology. 
Anticonvulsant activity of two orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and photically induced myoclonus in Papio papio. Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid CPG 37849 and the corresponding 1-ethyl ester CGP 39551, were tested as anticonvulsants in DBA/2 mice and photosensitive Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. In DBA/2 mice, CGP 37849 is more potent than CGP 39551 when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (ED50 for suppression of clonic seizures at 60 min: i.c.v. 0.038 and 0.21 nmol; i.p. 3.40 and 19.1 mumol/kg, respectively). When administered orally in mice, the two compounds are approximately equipotent (ED50 CGP 37849, 35.2 mumol/kg; ED50 CGP 39551, 28.1 mumol/kg). The time course of action of CGP 39551 is exceptionally prolonged: 42 mumol/kg i.p. protects against clonic seizures for 48 h. Protection provided by other NMDA antagonists in mice is of much shorter duration: 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5) 1 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) 4 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid 1-ethyl ester 3 h, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine carboxylic acid (CPP) 2 h, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) 4 h, and CGP 37849 4 h. After oral administration of the drugs, the therapeutic index (TI = ratio of the ED50 values for rotorod performance and anticonvulsant protection) remains relatively constant at 5.9-7.2 for 3 h (CGP 37849) and 4.0-6.1 for 24 h (CGP 39551). After i.p. administration, the TI values are CGP 37849 at 1 h 2.4, and at 3 h 20.0, CGP 39551 at 1 h 2.3, at 3 h 7.1, and at 24 h 3.6. In baboons, acute administration of CGP 37849 at doses of 48-191 mumol/kg intravenously (i.v.) suppresses photically induced myoclonus for at least 285 min, with severe side effects at the highest dose tested. CGP 39551 at doses of 169-675 mumol/kg i.v. shows weak anticonvulsant activity only at the highest dose tested (accompanied by severe side effects). CGP 37849 at 48-96 mumol/kg orally (p.o.) fails to protect against photically induced myoclonus up to 4 h after administration, but 191 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces complete suppression of seizures after 24 h. On the other hand, CGP 39551 at 169 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces total suppression of seizure activity at 4 h with a longer duration of anticonvulsant action (2-3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Mechanism of shock associated with right ventricular infarction. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the shock sometimes associated with right ventricular infarction, but only small numbers of patients with clinical shock have been studied. The haemodynamic profiles of seven patients with clinical cardiogenic shock after right ventricular myocardial infarction were studied prospectively. They were selected because all had a stable cardiac rhythm and none had absolute hypovolaemia during the study period. In all of them the mean right atrial pressure exceeded the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. After treatment with varying combinations of dopamine, dobutamine, and glyceryl trinitrate (titrated to achieve the optimum haemodynamic response) the mean systemic arterial pressure increased, as did the cardiac index. There was an associated increase in the left ventricular stroke work index but the right ventricular stroke work index was unchanged. There was no significant change in heart rate, mean right atrial pressure, or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. This suggests that the probable mechanism of the shock associated with right ventricular infarction is concomitant severe left ventricular dysfunction. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of paramedic emergency medical services in the treatment of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: 1) Identification of marginal costs associated with prehospital resuscitation of cardiopulmonary arrest; 2) Determination of cost effectiveness for such resuscitation; and 3) Comparison of cost effectiveness of paramedic care with selected other medical interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 190 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING: City limits of a midsized southwestern city. The events studied took place outside of medical facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom the EMS system was activated by a 911 telephone request for emergency medical assistance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost, including training, personnel, equipment, and response time maintenance, per year of life saved was found to be $8,886.00 for paramedic care. This result was compared with published cost-effectiveness figures for heart transplantation, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Paramedic care was more cost effective, as measured by cost per year of life saved, than organ transplantation and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital treatment by paramedics of cardiopulmonary arrest is more cost effective than heart, liver, bone marrow transplantation, or curative chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 
Prospects for the use of antagonists to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor to prevent post-angioplasty restenosis and thrombosis. Despite many advances since its inception in humans in 1977, coronary angioplasty continues to be limited by the problems of abrupt arterial closure and late restenosis. Excessive platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty undoubtedly plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both of these problems. Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function. Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty. 
Effective treatment of small-noncleaved-cell lymphoma with high-intensity, brief-duration chemotherapy. Small-noncleaved-cell (SNC) lymphoma is a high-grade, biologically aggressive neoplasm notable for poor response to therapy, high relapse rate, and less than a 20% long-term survival. We treated 20 patients with SNC lymphoma with a novel chemotherapeutic regimen using intensive doses of chemotherapy at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. All patients were previously untreated. Sixteen patients (80%) had stage IV disease. Most patients (95%) had at least one other characteristic associated with poor prognosis (bulky [greater than 10 cm] disease, multiple extranodal sites, poor performance status), and 85% had two or more characteristics associated with poor prognosis. Seventeen patients (85%) achieved a complete response (CR) to therapy, including all three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease. There have been three relapses, all occurring less than 18 months after treatment, and two of three relapses occurred in patients who were unable to complete therapy. At a median follow-up of 29 months, 13 patients (65%) remain disease-free; the calculated 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 60%. Toxicity, chiefly myelosuppression, was severe but manageable. There were two treatment-related deaths, both in elderly patients with poor performance status and advanced-stage disease. These data suggest that such a dose-intensive approach improves the response and survival of patients with SNC lymphoma. 
The transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the marrow after bone marrow transplantation. Of 14 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, 6 had a transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the bone marrow after transplantation. Most of these patients (11) had leukemia, although 3 had severe aplastic anemia. The cells were 8-18 micron in diameter and had scant cytoplasm and dense nuclei with smooth, homogeneous chromatin. They often had distinct nuclear clefts. These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells. They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-cell phenotype. CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells. The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage. The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells. The increase of small blastoid cells was a transient and self-limited phenomenon, in contrast to that of neoplastic blasts. These cells should be recognized as a common component of the bone marrow of marrow transplant recipients. The significance and role of these cells in immune recovery and hematopoiesis remain uncertain. 
Mitral valve replacement in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an eosinophil-mediated tissue injury causing multiple organ failure. Cardiac manifestations include subendocardial fibrosis, thrombus leading to peripheral emboli, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and valvar dysfunction. This article describes a patient with the syndrome and reviews surgical experience with valve replacement and long-term prognosis. 
Transrectal US in the diagnosis of localized colitis cystica profunda. Colitis cystica profunda (CCP) mimicks rectal carcinoma, which makes distinguishing this benign lesion from the more common rectal neoplasm clinically and pathologically difficult. When transrectal ultrasound (US) was used in this case, three features of CCP were seen. There were multiple lesions, which did not penetrate beyond the submucosa. A large cystic component was seen, with a layer of uniform thickness in two of the three lesions. Non-solid contents and a lack of infiltration can be visualized at transrectal US, which helps diagnose CCP. 
Headache syndromes as detected by configural frequency analysis. Data on headache symptoms obtained in two samples (N = 422 and 304) by means of questionnaires were subjected to configural frequency analysis (CFA). This not widely-known method tests whether certain symptom combinations appear more often or less often than expected by chance. In both samples symptom combinations corresponding to the syndromes of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and tension headache did indeed occur with significant frequency. The same clear-cut symptom patterns appeared when patients with preceding visual disturbances were excluded from analysis. These results seem to lend strong support to a categorical model of headache, rather than to the concept of headache as a spectrum. 
Recurrence after radiotherapy for glottic carcinoma. A series of 478 patients with T1-3N0 glottic carcinoma treated by irradiation is presented. Of these patients, 320 were previously untreated, whereas 158 patients were referred for treatment of a recurrence after receiving radiotherapy elsewhere. The primary recurrence rate in the previously untreated patients was 10%. The rate was higher in T2 and T3 tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and in patients who were in poor general condition. Over 80% of the recurrent tumors were Stage pT3 or pT4, whereas 12% of total laryngectomy specimens showed necrosis only with no evidence of tumor. The necrosis rate in previously untreated patients was 1% for T1 tumors, 4% for T2 tumors, and 3% for T3 tumors. Of all tumors, 60% were transglottic when they recurred, whereas only 29% were confined to the glottis at recurrence. Histologic diagnosis had a high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that a negative histologic report is unreliable. Of patients with a recurrent primary tumor, 13% were untreatable. The 5-year survival after a primary recurrence was 39%, and the main prognostic factors were sex, T stage at recurrence, and time to recurrence. Of patients available for follow-up at 5 years 49% were alive with a larynx, 5% were alive without a larynx, 13% were dead of the original cancer, and 33% had died of other causes. In those suffering a primary recurrence, the commonest cause of death was a subsequent lymph node metastasis, followed in order of frequency by stomal recurrence and recurrence in the pharyngeal remnant. The hospital mortality rate after laryngectomy was 3%, and 30% of patients undergoing laryngectomy developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The recurrence rate in lymph nodes was 14% at 5 years, general condition and T stage being the only significant predictors of recurrence. Only 17% of patients had small (N1) nodes by the time the diagnosis of cervical lymph node recurrence was made, and 27% of all patients were unsuitable for treatment. Host, tumor factors, and time to recurrence were not significant predictors of survival after node recurrence. The survival rate 5 years after node recurrence was 16%, and the main cause of death in those who died was uncontrolled disease in the neck. The hospital mortality after salvage neck dissection was 4.7%. 
Pulse oximetry monitoring outside the intensive care unit: progress or problem? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in general care units. DESIGN: Hemoglobin oxygen saturation data collected prospectively by use of pulse oximetry with concurrent review of the medical record. SETTING: General medical-surgical nursing units in a large, tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients on two nursing units monitored with continuous, bedside pulse oximetry at the request of their primary physicians. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. A research associate visited the bedside two or three times daily and recorded saturation compared with time data from the previous 8.75 hours. Patients were studied for 36 hours or until pulse oximetry monitoring was discontinued. Episodes of desaturation were counted. Patient charts were reviewed for documentation of desaturation in either nursing or physician notes. Orders adjusting oxygen therapy or other respiratory therapy within 12 hours of any desaturation episode were also recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty of the 40 patients (75%) had at least one episode of desaturation to less than 90%; 23 (58%) had at least one episode to less than 85%. Desaturation episodes were documented in nursing notes for only 33% of those patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in physician notes in only 7% of cases. Changes in respiratory therapy were ordered in 20% of patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in only 26% who desaturated to less than 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their repeated occurrence, episodes of hypoxemia were rarely documented in either nursing or physician notes. Further, even in patients who had episodic desaturation, pulse oximetry monitoring had little effect on changes in physician-directed respiratory care. 
Fatty infiltration in the liver in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem examination has been recommended as a criterion for selection of infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly for further biochemical investigation for disorders of fatty acid oxidation. We describe a boy with medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who died four months after diagnosis and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty infiltration was found. 
Peripheral neuropathy after chronic endoneurial ischemia. We have developed a method for producing chronic regional nerve ischemia in rats by creating proximal limb arteriovenous shunts. This procedure results in a 50 to 75% reduction in endoneurial blood flow within the distal sciatic nerve as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Nerve conduction velocities in sciatic nerves ipsilateral to the shunt fell by 25 to 30% within 2 weeks after creation of the shunt and did not recover for up to 10 months after the procedure. Morphological studies of the ischemic nerves showed structural abnormalities at nodes of Ranvier and mild axonal atrophy. Neither segmental demyelination nor axonal degeneration were evident. These results indicate that reduced endoneurial blood flow, insufficient to cause infarction, may result in measurable functional and morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves. 
Clinical comparison of polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) suture material. Over a 1-year period, 584 repairs of surgical defects were completed using two different synthetic absorbable sutures, polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon). No difference in scar width or postoperative complications were found between the two sutures, but polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) demonstrated preferable handling and tying characteristics. 
Low energy catheter ablation of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. A 38 year old woman with a structurally normal heart presented with near syncope and had right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. She was intolerant of antiarrhythmic medication and underwent low energy catheter ablation. Six non-arcing shocks of 25 J were delivered to the right ventricular outflow tract. No further ventricular tachycardia occurred during a follow up of seven months without antiarrhythmic treatment. 
Fixed subaortic stenosis: anatomical spectrum and nature of progression. Retrospective echocardiographic review identified 58 consecutive infants and children with fixed subaortic stenosis. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 4.8 (3.6) years (range two days to 14.7 years), and diagnosis occurred in infancy in eight. Associated cardiac abnormalities were present in 41 (71%) whereas fixed subaortic stenosis was an isolated lesion in 17 (29%). Four types of fixed subaortic stenosis were identified: short segment (47 (81%)), long segment (7 (12%)), posterior displacement of the infundibular septum with additional discrete narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (3 (5%)), and redundant tissue arising from the membranous septum (1 (2%)). Echocardiographic studies had been performed before the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis in nine patients, all with associated abnormalities. These were performed in infancy in each and showed a "normal" left ventricular outflow tract in six and posterior deviation of the infundibular septum in three. In 16 patients serial echocardiographic studies had been performed after the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis but before surgery of the left ventricular outflow tract. Rapid evolution of short segment to long segment narrowing was seen in one patient, and tethering of the aortic valve or mitral valve developed in a further four patients. Aortic valve or mitral valve involvement was not seen before the age of three years but was common thereafter (10/40 patients, 25%). Fixed subaortic stenosis may be an "acquired" lesion with the potential for changes in form as well as progression in severity of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 
Limited hepatic resection for selected cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma: a prospective study. From 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1989 123 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 122) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) were screened using liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein determination, ultrasonography with biopsy (and in selected cases computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance), laparoscopy and angiography, Child-Pugh classification and urea-nitrogen synthesis rate. Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients. 
The malignant nature of papillary and cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Two new cases of papillary and cystic neoplasm of the pancreas are reported. One patient was a 20-year-old woman with massive unresectable liver metastases, and the other was a 15-year-old boy. To study the natural history and malignant potential of this tumor, the English literature was reviewed to obtain an additional 56 cases. Clinical characteristics include pain and a mass in most patients, although many are found incidentally. Jaundice, hemoperitoneum, nausea, and vomiting are unusual findings. Most patients are treated by wide resection with good results. These tumors appear to be indolent. However, 16% of patients had major organ or blood vessel invasion, and 7% had liver metastases at some time during the course of their disease, illustrating the malignant nature of this tumor. Long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of treatment, especially in the case of locally advanced and metastatic disease. 
Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis after chronic administration of alcohol and "low-dose" carbon tetrachloride vapor in the rat Rats were exposed to carbon tetrachloride vapor, 5 days/wk, 6 hr/day, for periods of 5 or 10 wk at a concentration that by itself caused only fatty change with minimal liver cell necrosis and no fibrosis. The same carbon tetrachloride exposure when given in association with chronic alcohol feeding resulted in extensive hepatic fibrosis at 5 wk and established micronodular cirrhosis at 10 wk. The periodicity of the exposure profile was chosen to simulate that of human exposure to environmental toxins, albeit at a higher dose than would be permitted in the workplace. The development of significant liver injury in this animal model raises the possibility that some chronic liver injury in humans may be due to alcohol potentiation of other hepatotoxins present in the environment at subtoxic levels. 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
Osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience. Eighteen cases of osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck were treated at our institution between 1955 and 1987. The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 73 years, with a median age of 28 years. The sex distribution was equal. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 276 months, with a median of 79 months. The primary site of the tumor was the mandible in nine cases, maxilla and paranasal sinuses in six, skull in two, and orbit in one. Six of 18 patients were free of disease with greater than 5 years of follow-up. Four of the six received combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as their primary treatment. Of the five patients treated with surgery alone, four suffered recurrences, one of whom was salvaged with further surgery and chemotherapy. Five patients were treated initially without surgery. They received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy; all five developed local recurrence. We conclude that osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck is an aggressive tumor, prone to both local and distant failure. Based on our series and from published experience involving the extremities, osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck should be managed with multimodality therapy. 
Acute basophilic leukemia. A clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic study of eight cases. The authors describe eight cases of acute basophilic leukemia. In six of the eight cases, basophilic involvement was not apparent by light microscopic examination. The cases were identified on the basis of ultrastructural evidence for basophil/mast cell differentiation of the blasts with little or no differentiation into other lineages. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immature basophil granules in blasts in all eight cases and theta granules in blasts in four cases. In three cases, ultrastructural evidence of mast cell differentiation also was present, with rare cells showing evidence for both basophil and mast cell differentiation. No clinical features distinguished this group of patients from others with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetically, the cases were heterogeneous. Three had a Philadelphia chromosome; none had a t(6;9). The authors conclude that ultrastructural analysis usually must be used to diagnose acute basophilic leukemia, that acute basophilic leukemia is associated frequently with the Philadelphia chromosome, and that the ultrastructural findings provide evidence for a common origin of basophils and mast cells. 
Zones of differential sensory block during extradural anaesthesia. We have measured spinal segmental levels of anaesthesia to light touch (LT), pinprick (PP) and cold temperature discrimination (TE) during 2% lignocaine extradural anaesthesia in 22 patients, to determine if zones of differential sensory block develop during extradural anaesthesia and, if so, the extent to which TE extends beyond PP or LT levels and how age affects differential block. The median thoracic dermatomal levels were 4.5 for LT, 2.0 for PP and 2.0 for TE. Zones of differential sensory block developed within 5 min of extradural injection of local anaesthetic, and persisted for the next 55 min. In all instances, PP extended more cephalad than LT, and TE extended above PP levels. There were no differences in the extent of zones between the two groups of patients with mean ages of 28 and 48 yr. Thus, during extradural anaesthesia, sympathetic denervation extended one to two spinal segments above the sensory levels of LT and PP anaesthesia, age (28 vs 48 yr) affected neither the cephalad extent nor the width of zones of differential block, and PP levels of anaesthesia were closer to presumed levels of sympathetic block than were LT levels. 
Late complications involving the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery: recognition and management. Pseudoaneurysms and dissecting aneurysms of the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery are uncommon but important complications. Pseudoaneurysms, which result from extravasation of blood into the mediastinum, most commonly occur at the site of aortotomy or aortic cannulation. Infection may play an important role. Dissecting aneurysms after cardiac surgery usually occur at the site of aortic incision or cross clamping, especially in atherosclerotic aortas. Both conditions may be clinically silent but more frequently are seen with significant symptoms. Noninvasive techniques including CT scan, MRI, and echocardiography are very useful in the diagnosis of both complications, with contrast aortography remaining the definitive method. Surgical repair is necessary for dissecting aneurysms and for enlarging and symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, with improving morbidity and mortality. 
Endourology of lower urinary tract. Two methods for obtaining percutaneous access to the bladder are described. Depending on whether or not urethral access is available an endoscopic or fluoroscopic technique may be applied. We have successfully performed suprapubic percutaneous cystolitholapaxy, antegrade fulguration of posterior urethral valves, antegrade cystourethroscopy as an adjunct for urethroplasty, and internal drainage of a bulbar urethral abscess. Endourologic techniques may be readily applied to the lower urinary tract and may be specifically indicated in certain situations. 
Time-motion reconstruction of mitral leaflet motion from two-dimensional echocardiography in mitral valve prolapse. To assess the contributions of mitral leaflet billowing and exaggerated systolic mitral anular expansion to posterior motion of mitral leaflets recognized as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) by M-mode echocardiography, time-motion reconstructions of the anteroposterior displacement of points equally spaced along the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets were derived by computer-assisted analysis of 2-dimensional echocardiograms. Late or holosystolic posterior displacement of mitral leaflets, greater than or equal to 2 mm, occurred in the reconstructions from 24 of 24 (100%) patients with MVP with leaflet billowing and in 20 of 24 (83%) patients with MVP without leaflet billowing compared with 4 of 35 (11%) age-sex matched normal adults (both p less than 0.0000002). Posterior motion of the posterior mitral leaflet in time-motion reconstruction was significantly less with respect to the posterior end of the mitral anulus than with respect to the chest wall in patients with nonbillowing MVP (1.6 +/- 1.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.02), but not in those with leaflet billowing (3.6 +/- 1.8 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8, p = not significant), because anular expansion contributed importantly to MVP in the former but not in the latter group. Thus, M-mode echocardiographic patterns of MVP reflect the separate but interacting effects of distinct abnormalities of mitral anular and leaflet dynamics. 
Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma of the palate in a child. We report a case of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma involving the palate of a 12-year-old girl, the first example of this tumour occurring in the paediatric age group. The tumour displayed infiltrative growth, neural invasion, variegated histological patterns, and minimal cytological atypia. The patient remained disease-free four years after wide local excision of the tumour. The distinction of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma is also discussed. 
Experimental pain thresholds and plasma beta-endorphin levels during exercise. Experimental pain thresholds (electrical intracutaneous finger and dental pulp stimulation) and plasma hormone levels (beta-endorphin, cortisol, and catecholamines) were measured in ten healthy sportive men before, during, and after progressively more strenuous physical exercise. In a double-blind study conducted on two different days, 20 mg of the opioid-antagonist naloxone or placebo was administered prior to exercise. A significant pain threshold elevation was found during exercise for finger (ANOVA, P less than 0.004) and dental pulp stimulation (P less than 0.01). Pain threshold elevation was most pronounced during maximal exertion, at which time the subjects reported the greatest subjective fatigue. Thresholds remained elevated 10-15 min after the end of exercise, and, 60 min after exercise, thresholds returned to baseline values. The subjective magnitude estimation of suprathreshold stimuli was significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001) 5-10 min after exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin, cortisol, and catecholamines increased significantly (P less than 0.0005, all values) during exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin levels did not correlate significantly with pain thresholds (r = -0.37, NS). Naloxone failed to affect pain thresholds, although beta-endorphin and cortisol increased significantly more (P less than 0.02) during exercise after naloxone. It is concluded that short-term, exhaustive physical exercise can evoke a transient elevation in pain thresholds. This exercise-induced elevation in pain threshold does not, however, appear to be directly related to plasma endorphin levels. 
Arteriopathy and coarctation of the abdominal aorta in children with mucopolysaccharidosis: imaging findings. Eight children with mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), representing 33% of all children with MPS I seen at our institution during an 18-year period, developed hypertension. Five of these hypertensive children also exhibited symptoms of aortic coarctation. The radiographic evaluation of four of these children with MPS I (three with Hurler syndrome, MPS I H, and one with Scheie disease, MPS I S) and arteriopathy affecting the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and visceral and renal arteries is presented. Hypertension developed in all four children before they were 4 years old; three had differences between upper- and lower-extremity blood pressures. Irregular narrowing of the abdominal aorta with either multiple minor asymmetric wall lesions (n = 2) or abrupt concentric narrowing (n = 2) was present in all children as shown by aortography (n = 3), sonography (n = 3), MR imaging (n = 2), and/or autopsy (n = 1). A variety of other vessels also were involved, including the ascending aorta (n = 1) and vertebral (n = 1), axillary (n = 1), intercostal (n = 2), lumbar (n = 2), mesenteric (n = 3), renal (n = 2), and iliac arteries (n = 3). Autopsy in one child demonstrated thickened heart valves, narrowing of the coronary arteries, and irregularity of the aorta due to deposition of mucopolysaccharide material within the intima. Our series demonstrates various facets of the arteriopathy of MPS I as shown by sonography, MR imaging, and angiography. 
Congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of two types of leaking retinal macroaneurysms. We treated a patient with a rare combination of congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of leaking macroaneurysms of different types. Initially, leaking macroaneurysms developed in the shunt area of the arteriovenous communication; later, a preexistent fusiform macroaneurysm in the afferent arteriole of the congenital communication started leaking. Because exudates and fluid from the leaking macroaneurysms reached the fovea, laser treatment was performed to obliterate the macroaneurysms. We assume that after obliteration of the macroaneurysms with laser in the shunt area, the increase of hydrostatic pressure on the thin wall of the fusiform aneurysm of the afferent artery led to its leaking. We saw no signs of vascular occlusion after laser treatment. 
In vitro balloon dilatation of mitral valve stenosis: the importance of subvalvar involvement as a cause of mitral valve insufficiency. To investigate the mechanism that increases the orifice area of the mitral valve during balloon dilatation 43 surgically excised intact rheumatic mitral valves were studied. The main pathological features were (a) fibrosis of mitral valve leaflets and commissures (10 valves); (b) fibrosis with calcification of one commissure (eight anterolateral, seven posteromedial); (c) fibrosis with calcification of both commissures (seven valves); and (d) predominant involvement of the subvalvar apparatus (11 valves). The valves were assessed by photography and radiography before and after balloon dilatation (balloons up to 38 mm (bifoil 2 x 19 mm) and pressures up to 4 atmospheres). The valve was dilated in stages under direct visual control by balloons of increasing diameter. Splitting of the fused commissures was the most common mode of widening the orifice. However, the mitral valve leaflets were torn in two fibrotic valves and in six valves with extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus. In the fibrotic valves (group (a] the tear originated near the valve perimeter, at the thinnest part of the remaining valve leaflet. In the valves with subvalvar involvement splitting started at the apex of spaces between the fused chordal columns and proceeded upward. Where there is extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus in rheumatic mitral valve disease the risk of tearing of the valve leaflets by balloon dilatation is increased and this is likely to predispose to the development of acute valvar insufficiency. 
Diagnostic value of Lipiodol injection in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. We encountered a case of small focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver. It was difficult to distinguish FNH from hepatocellular carcinoma by means of sonography, computed tomography (CT), and angiography. After the injection of Lipiodol, it accumulated densely on FNH, but was washed away after a short time, as observed on the follow-up CT. This progress was different from that in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Systemic toxicity of ropivacaine during ovine pregnancy. Ropivacaine is a new amide local anesthetic structurally related to bupivacaine and mepivacaine. Its potency and duration of action are similar to those of bupivacaine but its therapeutic index may be greater. Since pregnancy enhances the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine, the current study was devised to compare the toxicity of ropivacaine in chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes during continuous intravenous infusion of the drug at the rate of 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1. In all animals, symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity occurred in the usual order--convulsions, hypotension, apnea, and circulatory collapse. There were no significant differences between the two groups of animals in the doses and plasma concentrations of ropivacaine associated with each toxic manifestations. For example, circulatory collapse occurred at a mean dose of 11.3 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1 in nonpregnant and 12.4 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1 in pregnant animals, with corresponding plasma concentrations of 7.3 +/- 0.3 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.ml-1 (P = not significant). Protein binding of ropivacaine in the concentration range associated with toxic manifestations was similar in sera obtained from nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. In conclusion, ovine pregnancy does not enhance the systemic toxicity of ropivacaine, possibly because of an absence of gestation-related increase in the availability of free drug. 
Claudication: an unusual side effect of DHE administration. DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine. The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety. DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation. The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine. There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE. This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE. Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE. Recovery was complete. 
Fatal varicella-zoster virus meningoradiculitis without skin involvement. A 77-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma developed an acute fatal meningoradiculitis of cranial nerve roots and cauda equina, pathologically and virologically confirmed to be caused by varicella-zoster virus. This is the first report of fatal varicella-zoster virus-induced neurological disease in the absence of skin lesions. Varicella-zoster virus should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute radiculoneuropathy in the immunocompromised patient, particularly because antiviral treatment for varicella-zoster virus exists. 
Cerebral vasculopathy associated with collateralization resembling moya moya phenomenon and with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. We describe a 48-year-old, previously healthy, anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibody positive black woman with negative risk factors for atherosclerosis, who developed mental status and personality changes over a 6-12-month period, and progressive cortical blindness over a 2-week period. Angiographic and computed axial tomographic studies of the brain demonstrated multiple large areas of infarction correlating with stenosis and occlusions of the internal carotid and posterior cerebral arteries. Moya moya-like findings were prominent radiographically. Results of angiographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were interpreted as being compatible with large, medium, and small vessel disease, most likely a vasculitis. 
Factors associated with poor visual outcome in acute retinal necrosis. We reviewed 22 consecutive patients (26 eyes) with acute retinal necrosis to elucidate whether there was any sign at an early stage to predict poor visual outcome. Final visual acuity of the patients fell into two groups, one worse than 20/600 (15 eyes) and the other better than 20/30 (11 eyes). The patients with poor visual outcome showed diffuse retinal arteritis or arterial obliteration which was associated with reduced amplitude of electroretinographic a and b waves and elevated levels of circulating immune complex, even at an early stage when retinal exudates were still localised to the peripheral fundus. The retinal exudates in these patients extended rapidly to the posterior pole. In contrast, the patients with good visual outcome showed retinal arteritis limited within retinal exudates throughout the course. These signs at an early stage can be used as prognostic factors to manage patients with acute retinal necrosis more constructively. 
Behavioral aspects of temperature-taking. Ear thermometry addresses two basic psychological aspects of fevers. The first one is obvious: the battle of the rectal temperature can be eliminated by ear thermometry. The second one addresses the overtreatment of tactile fevers. Tactile temperature taken by feeling the forehead occurs in 50% to 90% of homes. Half of warm foreheads occur in afebrile children who are warm because they're releasing heat generated by a recent activity or bath. If an actual temperature were measured, these children wouldn't be mislabeled as having fever and unnecessarily treated. 
Intrahepatic hematoma: a rare complication of exchange transfusion. A four-day-old male neonate who underwent three exchange transfusions for jaundice owing to ABO incompatibility on three consecutive days is presented. A large intrahepatic hematoma developed as a complication of the third exchange transfusion. The baby fully recovered. 
Hemodynamic effects of celiprolol in essential hypertension. The immediate and short-term (2 week) hemodynamic and humoral effects of the beta-1 antagonist, beta-2 agonist, celiprolol, were compared with those of more prolonged atenolol therapy in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Celiprolol produced an immediate dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (49 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.005) that was associated with an increased heart rate (67 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (2,347 +/- 129 to 2,708 +/- 111 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01). Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure with short-term treatment (p less than 0.01); this was associated with a reduced total peripheral resistance with celiprolol (from 24 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.02) and was not observed with atenolol. Moreover, in contrast with atenolol, celiprolol did not change heart rate or stroke and cardiac indexes. Splanchnic and forearm vascular resistances decreased with celiprolol (p less than 0.05) but not with atenolol; neither beta-blocking drug altered renal blood flow. These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were strikingly different from atenolol; celiprolol reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral and certain vascular resistances without altering heart rate, cardiac index or regional blood flows. These effects may be explained by celiprolol's cardiac beta-1 receptor inhibitory and peripheral beta-2 receptor agonistic effects. 
Ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in suspected acute myocardial infarction. Continuous electrocardiography during the first 24 hours of a stay in a coronary care unit was used to record ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or placebo. Recordings were made on 378 of the 436 patients admitted to a double blind trial of alteplase or placebo in one participating centre of the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombosis (ASSET), patients being selected according to the availability of recorders. Of these, 309 (158 given alteplase and 151 placebo) had greater than 5 hours of analysable data. Most of the arrhythmias were recorded in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia were significantly more common in the patients treated with alteplase. Further, in patients with myocardial infarction who had ventricular extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia type a, the number of hours in which each arrhythmia was recorded was significantly higher in the alteplase group. The various ventricular arrhythmias in the alteplase group tended to cluster in the first 4-12 hours of the recordings. During the first 24 hours admission there were four episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the alteplase group and five in the placebo group of taped patients. By one month there had been 18 deaths in these 309 patients (alteplase four, placebo 14). These bore no relation to any recorded arrhythmia. Clinical records for the patients with no or minimal tape data yielded six further episodes of ventricular fibrillation during the first 24 hours (three in the alteplase group and three in the placebo group). 
Multivariate assessment of traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease in very low birth weight neonates. The Newborn Lung Project. All neonates (n = 581) with birth weights less than 1501 gm admitted to seven neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin and Iowa were candidates for a study aimed at the multivariate assessment of risk factors for chronic lung disease while controlling for baseline severity of respiratory disease. Data from 361 neonates were analyzed for all risk factors except fluids; only neonates weighing less than 1200 gm were included (n = 220). Information on traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease was abstracted. A total of 110 (30%) of the analyzed neonates were oxygen dependent on day 30 of life. The following baseline factors were associated with increased risk of oxygen dependence in a joint multivariate model: lower birth weight (odds ratio 1.4/100 gm), higher baseline severity score (odds ratio 2.7/doubling at 32 weeks gestational age), lower gestational age (odds ratio 2.4/week at severity 0), Apgar score at 1 minute (odds ratio 1.6/2 points), male gender (odds ratio 1.9), and nonblack race (odds ratio 2.2). After adjustment for all baseline factors, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilator pressure at 96 hours, oxygen at 96 hours, and fluid intake were associated with oxygen dependence. Neonates with a low baseline severity score who remained oxygen dependent had a higher intake of fluid relative to output, whereas neonates with a higher baseline severity score had higher fluid intake and output. Lack of weight loss was associated with increased severity but not with oxygen dependence. The results of this study generally confirm the significance of previously reported risk factors for chronic lung disease in a multivariate setting but show that risk factors may not have the same impact in neonates with different baseline severity. 
MR imaging of the seminal vesicles. MR imaging (0.35 and 1.50 T) was used to assess the appearance of the seminal vesicles. The size and signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles vary with the age of the subject. In general, on T2-weighted images, the signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles is lower than that of fat in prepubertal children, similar to or higher than that of fat in adults, and similar to or lower than that of fat in patients older than 70 years of age. Endocrine and radiation therapy will influence the size and signal intensity of the seminal vesicles. The purpose of the essay is to illustrate the spectrum of seminal vesicle disease, including congenital anomalies, inflammation, and neoplastic disease. Although MR imaging is helpful in depicting seminal vesicle abnormalities, it does not allow differentiation of benign from malignant disease, distinction of hemorrhage due to tumor invasion from postbiopsy changes, or distinguishing between glandular obstruction due to tumor infiltration and mechanical compression. 
A comparative, randomized study of low-dose human menopausal gonadotropin and follicle-stimulating hormone in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment with low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is associated with a high rate of ovulation in anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), but it is not clear whether the success of treatment is because of the use of pure FSH or the low dose of gonadotropin. We undertook a randomized controlled study to compare the effects of urinary FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) using a low-dose regimen in 30 women with PCOS. Each subject received a maximum of three cycles of either FSH or hMG. Ovulation occurred in 75% of subjects and in 77% of cycles induced with FSH and in 94% of women, 85% of cycles of those treated with hMG. A single dominant follicle developed in 70% (FSH) and 65% (hMG) of cycles, respectively. Five singleton pregnancies occurred in each group. This study shows that low-dose FSH and hMG are equally successful in inducing ovulation, suggesting that the success of treatment depends on the low dose of gonadotropin used rather than the presence or absence of luteinizing hormone in the preparation. 
Platelet aggregating activity in serum from patients with HLA-B27 associated rheumatic and cardiac disorders: a possible link to the proliferative vascular changes. OBJECTIVE--To search for possible serum factors (immunochemical abnormalities) that reflect HLA-B27 associated inflammatory process with the proliferative endarteritis, which is an important cause of severe bradycardia and aortic valve regurgitation. PATIENTS AND METHODS--Seventy four men with pacemakers were studied: 24 were HLA-B27 positive and had associated rheumatic and cardiac disorders, 13 were B27 positive but had no clinical or radiographic signs of a related rheumatic condition, and 37 were B27 negative controls. Randomly obtained serum samples were examined for a series of serum factors. RESULTS--Thirteen (57%) of the 23 patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions had platelet aggregating activity in their serum. No such activity was found in sera from patients in the other groups. None the less, immunochemical abnormalities were common among patients of all groups; 30 (41%) had antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor or both. CONCLUSION--The platelet aggregating activity found in patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions may reflect serum factors that increase the stickiness of platelets and increase their adhesion to the vessel wall. This suggests a link via release of platelet derived growth factor(s) with the characteristic histopathological feature of proliferative endarteritis. Immunochemical abnormalities were common in serum from all men with pacemakers. 
Tertiary syphilis of the face. We report a case of noduloulcerative tertiary syphilis that had gone misdiagnosed as discoid lupus erythematosus for many years. This case is noteworthy for (1) a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction, (2) a dramatic response to penicillin therapy despite the presence of long-standing disease, and (3) posttreatment granulomas of possible hypersensitivity origin. 
Detection of human papillomavirus in head and neck tumors with DNA hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in oral, sinus, pharynx, and larynx lesions of Japanese patients was studied by Southern blot hybridization under less stringent (25% formamide, 42 degrees C) and stringent (50% formamide, 42 degrees C) conditions. Three samples from 10 benign tumors, and 3 of 30 malignant tumors, contained HPV DNA or HPV-related sequences. The HPV DNAs harbored in three laryngeal papillomas were HPV-11, -6, and -6 or -11, respectively. The HPV DNA and viral capsid antigens were easily detected by in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining. However, neither the typical restriction pattern of HPV DNA nor viral antigen was identified in the malignant tumors, suggesting that subgenomic fragments remained integrated in the host cell DNA. 
Diagnostic relevance of trigeminal evoked potentials following infraorbital nerve stimulation. A new tool in neurophysiological exploration of the trigeminal nerve has recently been introduced. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem. The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma). They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia. Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases). Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone. 
Application of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA sequence polymorphisms to the study of HBV transmission. Short sequences in hypervariable regions of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome can be used to identify different strains, providing a novel approach to the study of HBV transmission. The nucleotide sequence in positions 2551-2650 (1:EcoRI site) was determined for serum HBV DNA from 96 Chinese children living in Hong Kong and from 38 of their parents. HBV DNA was extracted and sequenced after amplification with the polymerase chain reaction, using as primers oligonucleotides corresponding to two conserved sequences. Among 82 unrelated children, 32 HBV DNA variants were present. One sequence was present in 33 children and 31 variants were found among the other 49. Siblings within each of nine families had the same variant; in three families siblings had different variants. Six of the eight fathers and 28 of the 30 mothers had HBV DNA sequences identical to those of their offspring. A total of 34 variants were found among the 134 individuals. The hypothesis of random assortment of sequences in parents and children was rejected (P less than .00005). Thus, this new approach proves the occurrence of intrafamilial transmission of HBV among Chinese. 
Antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron after outpatient laparoscopy. The safety and efficacy of ondansetron were evaluated for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic surgical procedures. Seventy-one healthy, consenting outpatients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. A standardized anesthetic technique consisting of alfentanil-thiopental-succinylcholine for induction and alfentanil-nitrous oxide-succinylcholine for maintenance of anesthesia was used. Patients in whom postoperative nausea and/or vomiting developed and persisted for greater than or equal to 10 min received equivolemic intravenous injections of either ondansetron (8 mg) or saline (placebo) over a 2-5 min period. Ondansetron significantly decreased the posttreatment nausea scores (vs placebo) without increasing sedation or producing changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. In the placebo-treated group, 92% of the patients experienced subsequent episodes of vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit compared with 51% of the patients in the ondansetron group. Finally, only 43% of the ondansetron-treated patients required a "rescue" antiemetic compared with 86% in the placebo group. Thus, ondansetron (8 mg IV) was associated with a decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting after outpatient laparoscopic procedures. 
The rhombotin family of cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes: distinct members are involved in T-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13. A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene. This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains. 
Racial differences in responses to thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Increased fibrin(ogen)olysis in blacks. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction Study Group. To determine whether there are differences in responses to thrombolytic therapy in certain populations, the data for the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (phase 1) study were analyzed for black and white patients. Baseline variables including risk factors and extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the 352 white and 24 black patients. The time from onset of chest pain to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy and rt-PA dosing regimens were the same in the two groups. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery at 90 minutes was 91% for blacks and was 72% for whites (p = 0.051). Blacks displayed significantly lower nadir fibrinogen levels (0.57 +/- 0.62 versus 1.3 +/- 0.76 g/l, p less than 0.0001), greater delta fibrinogen (baseline-nadir) (2.7 +/- 1.1 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 g/l, p less than 0.0001), and increased peak levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (837 +/- 865 versus 245 +/- 475 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.0001). rt-PA antigen levels tended to be higher in blacks than in whites (2.8 +/- 2.2 versus 2.2 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml [p = 0.10] at the peak and 1.6 +/- 1.3 versus 0.99 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml [p = 0.06] at the end of the maintenance infusion). Major clinical outcomes including survival until time of hospital discharge (92% black versus 93% white, p = 0.68) were not significantly different. However, despite undergoing fewer angioplasty procedures (25% versus 46.3%, p = 0.047), blacks received more transfusions (58.8% versus 19.5% were administered greater than or equal to 2 units packed erythrocytes, p = 0.001). 
Cutaneous silica granuloma. A rare entity or rarely diagnosed? Report of two cases with review of the literature. Cutaneous silica granuloma is a poorly understood, uncommon condition that may mimic cutaneous sarcoidosis. We describe two cases of this entity and their characteristic latency period (between the time of silica exposure to the time of clinical onset of granuloma). We also review the histologic and energy dispersive x-ray analysis data, which prove the diagnosis. This condition should be recognized as an occupational dermatosis as well as the result of past incidental cuts or abrasions, which result in the development of granulomas, many in old wound scars. Differentiation from cutaneous sarcoidosis is possible with polarized light microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. 
Congenital keratinizing desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract. We report the clinical and pathological findings of a case of congenital desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract associated with body dysmorphism. This entity has not been described previously in the literature. 
High-dose epinephrine improves the return of spontaneous circulation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the return of spontaneous circulation (RSC) rates in human victims of cardiac arrest treated with standard doses of epinephrine (SDE) or high-dose epinephrine (HDE). DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: A university hospital emergency department during 1987 through 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: At the discretion of the treating physician, patients received epinephrine in bolus doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg. HDE was defined as a dose of at least 0.2 mg/kg; smaller doses were defined as SDE. Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. Patients were also grouped by their presenting rhythm. Potentially perfusing rhythm was electromechanical dissociation or ventricular tachycardia. Nonperfusing rhythm was asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Rates were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and the two-tailed unpaired t test. HDE improved the rate of initial resuscitation (P = .008). The effect was greatest in patients with nonperfusing rhythms (P = .014) and disappeared when evaluating patients with potentially perfusing rhythms. No patient survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: High-dose epinephrine improves initial resuscitation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. Its greatest effect is in patients with a nonperfusing rhythm. 
Comparison of needle aspiration cytologic diagnosis with excisional biopsy tissue diagnosis of palpable tumors of the breast in a community hospital. Fine needle aspiration cytologic examination has not extensively been used in our hospital in the work-up evaluation of solid tumors of the breast and its reliability as a basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast was in question. One hundred and five aspiration cytologic specimens were obtained from palpable solid tumors of the breast just prior to excisional biopsy. Specimens were numbered and submitted to three different staff pathologists for diagnosis in a single blind manner. Results were then compared with tissue diagnosis of the same tumors. Of 105 specimens taken at biopsy of the breast, 28 malignant lesions were diagnosed on the final tissue report. Of those, ten were diagnosed as malignant (Class V), two were highly suspicious (Class IV) and six were insufficient specimens (Class O). Of those diagnosed as class IV and V by the results of cytologic examination, all were malignant on permanent section for a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 36 per cent. The cytologic diagnoses of Classes I, II and III did not correlate with any histologic report, benign or malignant. Malignant growths were misdiagnosed by cytologic examination in 36 per cent and missed because of inadequate specimens in 28 per cent. We believe that a Class V cytologic finding is sufficient basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast provided rigid criteria are used. There is a learning curve associated with this diagnostic modality. 
Diabetes-induced alterations in atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression in Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. We investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) synthesis, hemodynamic parameters, blood volume, and histopathology, as well as the reversibility of such effects with insulin therapy in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The biatrial ANP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the diabetic WKY rats increased by 16-17% compared with those in the age-matched WKY rats at 12 weeks after the onset of diabetes, whereas their ventricular ANP mRNA levels showed increases of 190% in left ventricles and 160% in right ventricles at 8 weeks. In the diabetic SHRs, the left atrial ANP mRNA levels increased by 36% compared with those in the age-matched SHRs, as early as 4 weeks after diabetes onset. Their ventricular ANP mRNA levels also showed 80-82% increases in left and right ventricles at 4 weeks. In proportion to changes in cardiac ANP synthesis, the biventricular end-diastolic pressures were significantly elevated at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and at 4 weeks in the diabetic SHRs. The blood volume significantly increased at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and remained higher thereafter, whereas it did not change in the diabetic SHRs throughout the experimental period. The left ventricular peak dP/dt was depressed in the 8-week diabetic SHRs, whereas in the diabetic WKY rats, its depression was observed at 12 weeks after diabetes onset. Histopathological studies showed that diabetic changes in ANP synthesis and hemodynamic parameters described above occurred before the cardiomyopathic histological changes. Cardiac ANP synthesis in the diabetic rats completely reverted to control levels after insulin therapy, accompanied by normalization of hemodynamic parameters. The present study indicates that 1) ANP synthesis is significantly augmented in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat compared with that in the normal rat, and the combination of diabetes and hypertension produces an earlier and greater effect in stimulating cardiac ANP synthesis than does either disease alone; 2) an elevation in the intraventricular filling pressure that occurs before observable cardiomyopathic histopathological alterations might be involved partially in the augmented ANP synthesis; and 3) the reversibility with insulin therapy suggests that the streptozotocin-induced alterations observed in cardiac ANP synthesis and hemodynamics result from insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, not from cardiac toxicity of streptozotocin. 
Lack of effect of peroral acyclovir for the treatment of acute infectious mononucleosis. Perorally administered acyclovir was evaluated in the therapy of acute infectious mononucleosis in a multicentered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 120 patients received 600 mg of acyclovir or placebo five times daily for 10 days. All patients were entered into the study within 7 days of symptom onset and had a positive Monospot test. Analysis of mean values and time to resolution of fever, lymphadenopathy, weight change, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver function tests, atypical lymphocytes, hours of bed rest, sense of well-being, and return to normal activities revealed no significant differences. There was a trend toward suppression of Epstein-Barr virus excretion in the oropharynx in acyclovir recipients. No toxicity was detected in patients treated with acyclovir. Under the conditions of the study, there was no evidence that treatment with perorally administered acyclovir affected the course of infectious mononucleosis. 
Eicosapentanoic acid suppresses intimal hyperplasia after expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet. The effect of purified eicosapentanoic acid on intimal fibrous hyperplasia in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was examined in 18 rabbits undergoing infrarenal aorta reconstruction. Six rabbits received commercial rabbit chow (control group), six a regular diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol (cholesterol group), and six the cholesterol diet with 91.1% pure eicosapentanoic acid 500 mg/day (eicosapentanoic acid group). Grafts were harvested 3 months after surgery for histologic examination. The platelet count and serum beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Serum arachidonic acid level in the cholesterol group was significantly higher than in the control group, and serum eicosapentanoic acid levels in the eicosapentanoic acid group were significantly higher than in the remaining two groups. Intergroup differences in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 concentrations were not significant. Intimal thickness at midgraft was 5.2 +/- 6.2 microns in the control group, 67.6 +/- 46.9 microns in the cholesterol group, and 19.2 +/- 18.4 microns in the eicosapntanoic acid group. intimal thickness in the cholesterol group was greater than in either the control or licosapentanoic acid group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that eicosapentanoic acid reduces intimal fibrous proliferation in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting as a result of hypercholesterolemia and that this effect is independent of the platelet count, activated platelet factors, and the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 ratio. 
Transforming growth factor alpha expression helps to distinguish keratoacanthomas from squamous cell carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas may be difficult to distinguish histologically from squamous cell carcinomas. We studied 20 keratocanthomas and 22 squamous cell carcinomas immunohistochemically using an antibody directed against transforming growth factor alpha to determine if the pattern of transforming growth factor alpha expression would provide a useful method of differentiating these tumors. Ninety percent of the keratoacanthomas demonstrated a diffuse pattern within tumor lobules in which all but the most peripheral rim of cells were stained. A similar localization of transforming growth factor alpha was not identified in squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, 40% of the squamous cell carcinomas but none of the keratoacanthomas showed focal transforming growth factor alpha immunostaining. Our results suggest that transforming growth factor alpha expression may be a marker of epithelial differentiation and may help distinguish between these two tumors.
